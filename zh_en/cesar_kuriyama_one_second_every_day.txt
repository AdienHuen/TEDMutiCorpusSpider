zh-cn:我是一名艺术家。我住在纽约，从事广告设计，从毕业开始我就一直做这行，至今已经七、八年了，慢慢的感觉有点厌倦了。我熬了很多夜，在办公室度过了很多的周末，我发现自己一直没有时间来做我真正想做的个人项目。
en:So, I&#39;m an artist.I live in New York, and I&#39;ve been working in advertisingfor — ever since I left school,so about seven, eight years now,and it was draining.I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends,and I found myself never having time for all the projectsthat I wanted to work on on my own.

zh-cn:有一天我在工作的时候看到了施德明（Stefan Sagmeister）在TED上的演讲，主题叫“时间流逝的力量”，他提到他每过七年，就拿出一年时间来休假，抛开工作，做自己的富有创造力的项目，我的思路被他打开了，然后我说：“我也要这么干，我要休一年的假。”“我需要时间旅行，陪伴家人，”“开始自己的富有创造力的想法。”
en:And one day I was at work and I saw a talkby Stefan Sagmeister on TED,and it was called &quot;The power of time off,&quot;and he spoke about how every seven years,he takes a year off from work so he coulddo his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired,and I just said, &quot;I have to do that. I have to take a year off.I need to take time to travel and spend time with my familyand start my own creative ideas.&quot;

zh-cn:我的项目中，第一个项目的名字叫“每天一秒钟”。大意就是我每天都坚持给自己录一秒钟的视频，下半辈子一直坚持下去，慢慢的将这些一秒钟的视频拼接起来，将我的生活的片段拼接成一段连续的视频，直到我没有能力再录制这些视频为止。
en:So the first of those projects ended up beingsomething I called &quot;One Second Every Day.&quot;Basically I&#39;m recording one second of every day of my lifefor the rest of my life,chronologically compiling these one-secondtiny slices of my life into one single continuous videountil, you know, I can&#39;t record them anymore.

zh-cn:项目的目的是，第一：我不喜欢忘记自己过去做过的事情。有很多我之前做过的事情，我都想不起来了，直到有人提起来的时候，我或许才能想起来，“对哦，我还做过这件事情。”在这个项目开始的早期阶段我发现如果今天过的不是很有趣，我可能会忘记录制视频。所以有一天，当我第一次忘记录制视频的时候，我非常的难过，我真的不想漏掉自己的生活记录。从我三十岁那时起，我就希望能够将这个项目延续到我死掉，而漏录了那天的一秒钟，我意识到，某种意义上这让我的脑子再也不会忘记这件事情了。
en:The purpose of this project is, one:I hate not remembering things that I&#39;ve done in the past.There&#39;s all these things that I&#39;ve done with my lifethat I have no recollection ofunless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,&quot;Oh yeah, that&#39;s something that I did.&quot;And something that I realized early on in the projectwas that if I wasn&#39;t doing anything interesting,I would probably forget to record the video.So the day — the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me,because it&#39;s something that I really wanted to —from the moment that I turned 30, I wantedto keep this project going until forever,and having missed that one second, I realized,it just kind of created this thing in my headwhere I never forgot ever again.

zh-cn:所以如果我能活到80岁，我的视频能够达到5个小时长度，浓缩了我50年的生活。当我到了40岁的时候，是1个小时，从我30岁开始算。这个项目让我每天醒来都生龙活虎想着今天要做哪些有趣的事情才好。
en:So if I live to see 80 years of age,I&#39;m going to have a five-hour videothat encapsulates 50 years of my life.When I turn 40, I&#39;ll have a one-hour videothat includes just my 30s.This has reallyinvigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up,to try and do something interesting with my day.

zh-cn:现在，我要处理的问题之一就是，随着时间一天一天、一个月一个月的过去，日子似乎变得模糊起来边界变得不那么明显你们知道，我不喜欢这种感觉，而可以看见的影像是激发回忆的方式。这个项目对我而言就是一座让我能够回忆起我过去生活的桥梁即使只是短短的一秒钟的视频，也能让我回忆起一整天的事情。有时候要在一天中选择一秒钟并不容易。美好的一天里，我真的想要多录制三秒或四秒，但是我只能把它压缩到一秒，但是即使压缩到了只有一秒钟，也足以让我记住一整天的回忆。
en:Now, one of the things that I have issues with is that,as the days and weeks and months go by,time just seems to start blurringand blending into each otherand, you know, I hated that,and visualization is the way to trigger memory.You know, this project for me is a way for meto bridge that gap and remember everything that I&#39;ve done.Even just this one second allows me to remembereverything else I did that one day.It&#39;s difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.On a good day, I&#39;ll have maybe three or four secondsthat I really want to choose,but I&#39;ll just have to narrow it down to one,but even narrowing it down to that one allows meto remember the other three anyway.

zh-cn:这个项目也是一种个人的抗议行为，抗议这样的一种现象、一种人，他们参加音乐会时会用手机把整场音乐会都录下来，并且打扰了你欣赏音乐。他们可能根本不喜欢这个音乐会。他们在手机上观看音乐会。我不喜欢这样。我承认或多或少的我也曾经如此。而我后来意识到，让自己记录和保留视频资料，同时又避免成为我不喜欢的那种人的最好的方法就是，只录一秒钟的时间，让我能够触发对当天生活的回忆。“音乐会棒极了，我真的很喜欢。”只需要短短的一秒钟。
en:It&#39;s also kind of a protest, a personal protest,against the culture we have now where peoplejust are at concerts with their cell phones outrecording the whole concert, and they&#39;re disturbing you.They&#39;re not even enjoying the show.They&#39;re watching the concert through their cell phone.I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit,back in the day, and I&#39;ve decided that the best wayfor me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my lifeand not be that person, is to just record that one secondthat will allow me to trigger that memory of,&quot;Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert.&quot;And it just takes a quick, quick second.

zh-cn:今年夏天我度了三个月的假。这是我一生梦寐以求的东西，开车环游美国和加拿大，每天只需想明天去哪里，这样的生活太棒了。后来没钱了，我在路途上花了太多的钱，把为休假一年准备的存款都花光了，所以我不得不跑到西雅图跟一些朋友一起花了一点时间赶了一个小项目赚钱。我休假一年的目的之一是花更多的时间陪伴我的家人，而这期间发生了一件悲剧性的事情，我的小姨子，一天突发肠梗塞，我们把她送到了急救室，而她的情况非常的糟糕。我们有好几次差点就失去了她，我跟我的哥哥每天都守在旁边。这让我意识到在这个项目的另一个重要之处，就是在这些悲伤的日子中记录自己的生活是非常非常的困难的。它不像是 —- 如果我们要做一些很酷的事情时，我们可能会带上相机。或者，“哦，这个聚会太棒了，我要拍张照。”但是我们很少在有不好的事情发生时这么做，很少在心情糟糕的时候拍照。而这让我发现了记录生活中非常糟糕的时刻，哪怕只记录一秒钟，是多么的重要。它会让你更加珍惜那些好时光。日子不会一帆风顺，但你某天过得不顺利，我认为将它记录下来是很重要的，尽你的所能去回忆那些（好）时光。
en:I was on a three-month road trip this summer.It was something that I&#39;ve been dreaming about doing my whole life,just driving around the U.S. and Canadaand just figuring out where to go the next day,and it was kind of outstanding.I actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road tripfor the savings that I had to take my year off,so I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some timewith friends working on a really neat project.One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family,and this really tragic thing happened wheremy sister-in-law,her intestine suddenly strangled one day,and we took her to the emergency room,and she was, she was in really bad shape.We almost lost her a couple of times,and I was there with my brother every day.It helped me realize something else during this project,is that recording that one second on a really bad dayis extremely difficult.It&#39;s not — we tend to take our cameras out when we&#39;re doing awesome things.Or we&#39;re, &quot;Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture.&quot;But we rarely do that when we&#39;re having a bad day,and something horrible is happening.And I found that it&#39;s actually been very, very importantto record even just that one second of a really bad moment.It really helps you appreciate the good times.It&#39;s not always a good day, so when you have a bad one,I think it&#39;s important to remember it,just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.

zh-cn:我录制的所有视频都没有做过特效处理，什么处理都没有——我希望自己录制的视频能够最大程度的还原我眼睛看到的样子。我一开始就用第一人称视角拍摄。早先我想过用两个摄像机，其中一个把我录进去，但是后来觉得这不是我想要的。真正记录我的生活的方法，是记录我实际看到的样子。
en:Now one of the things that I do is I don&#39;t use any filters,I don&#39;t use anything to — I try to capture the momentas much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes.I started a rule of first person perspective.Early on, I think I had a couple of videos whereyou would see me in it, but I realized that wasn&#39;t the way to go.The way to really remember what I sawwas to record it as I actually saw it.

zh-cn:现在关于这个项目，我有的一些想法是，如果很多人都一起做这件事情，会不会很有趣？视频里是上周我刚满31岁的样子。我想如果每个人都像我这么做，那一定会非常的有趣。我相信每个人都会有自己的解读。我相信每个人都会从他们每天一秒钟的视频记录中获益。就我而言，我不喜欢忘记过去，而录制视频是非常简单的事情。我们每个人的口袋里都有一台能录制高清视频的摄像机——我打赌绝大多数人都有——或者有类似的东西——我再也不想忘记我生活过的任何一天，这是我记住过去方式，而如果你能够在一个网站上输入“2018年6月18日”，然后就能看到全世界无数的人在那天的生活视频，那一定非常有意思。
en:Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are,wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this?I turned 31 last week, which is there.I think it would be interesting to seewhat everyone did with a project like this.I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.Personally, I&#39;m tired of forgetting,and this is a really easy thing to do.I mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now —most people in this room, I bet —and it&#39;s something that&#39;s —I never want to forget another day that I&#39;ve ever lived,and this is my way of doing that,and it&#39;d be really interesting also to see,if you could just type in on a website,&quot;June 18, 2018,&quot;and you would just see a stream of people&#39;s liveson that particular day from all over the world.

zh-cn:我不知道，我觉得这个项目有很多可能性，我号召你们每个人每天都录制自己的一小段视频，这样你就不会忘记你生活过的日子。
en:And I don&#39;t know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities,and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day,so you can never forget that that day, you lived.
