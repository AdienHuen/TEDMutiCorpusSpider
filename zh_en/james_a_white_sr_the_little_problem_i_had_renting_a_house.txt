zh-cn:作为一个18岁的非裔美国人，我加入了美国空军，被分配到芒廷霍姆空军基地，成为了空中警察中队的一员。报到之后，我的第一件事就是想租一间公寓，这样我就能把我妻子和刚出生的宝宝，梅兰妮都带到爱达荷。
en:An 18-year-old, African-American malejoined the United States Air Forceand was assigned to Mountain Home Air Force Baseand was a part of the air police squadron.Upon first arriving there,the first goal that I hadwas for me to identify an apartment,so I could bring my wife and my new baby, Melanie,out to join me in Idaho.

zh-cn:我立刻跑到人事部，询问那里的工作人员，他们说，“在爱达荷州的芒廷霍姆租房子很容易啊。这里的居民很喜欢我们，因为他们知道，如果是空军士兵租他们公寓的话，肯定不会拖欠房租。“这事儿对他们（房东）来说很重要。他说，“我这有个单子，你给这些房东打电话，他们会让你去挑一个喜欢的公寓的。”我收下单子，打了电话。一位女士接了电话，我告诉她我想租房子。她说，“哦，你问的正是时候。我们手头有四、五套公寓要出租呢。”她问，“你要一间卧室的还是两间卧室的？”她又说，“还是别在电话里说了。你直接过来看，挑一套你喜欢的。我们把合同签了，你立刻就能拿到钥匙，你们一家马上就能住进来。”
en:I immediately went to the personnel office,and talking with the guys in personnel,they said, &quot;Hey, no problem finding an apartment in Mountain Home, Idaho.The people down there love us because they know if they have an airmanwho is coming in to rent one of their apartments,they&#39;ll always get their money.&quot;And that was a really important thing.He said, &quot;So here is a list of people that you can call,and then they will then allow you to select the apartment that you want.&quot;So I got the list; I made the call.The lady answered on the other endand I told her what I wanted.She said, &quot;Oh, great you called.We have four or five apartmentsavailable right now.&quot;She said, &quot;Do you want a one-bedroom or two-bedroom?&quot;Then she said, &quot;Let&#39;s not talk about that.Just come on down, select the apartment that you want.We&#39;ll sign the contractand you&#39;ll have keys in your handto get your family out here right away.&quot;

zh-cn:我高兴坏了。我跳进车里，开到市区，来到那位女士家。我敲开门，那位女士来到门口，她看了我一眼，问，“你有什么事吗？”我说，“是的，我就是刚刚打电话要租房的人。我是来挑房子的。”她说，“我跟你说，我非常抱歉，我丈夫已经把这些公寓都租出去了，但他没告诉我。”我说，“他在一小时之内把五套公寓都租出去了？”她没接我茬，而是对我说，“把你的电话留下吧，如果我们再有房源，我会跟你联系。”不用想，她再没跟我联系。单子上其他的房东也没有给我任何答复。
en:So I was excited.I jumped in my car. I went downtownand knocked on the door.When I knocked on the door, the woman came to the door,and she looked at me, and she said,&quot;Can I help you?&quot;I said, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m the person who called about the apartments.I was just coming down to make my selection.&quot;She said, &quot;You know what? I&#39;m really sorry,but my husband rented those apartmentsand didn&#39;t tell me about them.&quot;I said, &quot;You mean he rented all five of them in one hour?&quot;She didn&#39;t give me a response,and what she said was this:She said, &quot;Why don&#39;t youleave your number,and if we have some openings, I&#39;ll give you a call?&quot;Needless to say,I did not get a call from her.Nor did I get any responses from the other peoplethat they gave me on the listwhere I could get apartments.

zh-cn:带着这样的结果和挫败感，我回到基地，找到了我们中队的指挥官。他叫麦克道，麦克道少校。我说，“麦克道少校，我需要您的帮助。”我告诉他事情经过，他说，“詹姆斯，我很想帮你。但是你要明白：别人不想租给你房子，我们也不能强迫啊。而且，我们跟这个社区的居民关系很好，我实在不想把关系搞僵。”他说，“也许你应该这么办。你还是别让家人来随军了，你也知道，你（每年）有30天假期。所以每一年，你都可以回家探亲，和家人待30天，再回来报到。”
en:So as a result of that,and feeling rejected,I went back to the base, and I talkedto the squadron commander.His name was McDow, Major McDow.I said, &quot;Major McDow, I need your help.&quot;I told him what happened, and here&#39;s what he said to me:He said, &quot;James, I would love to help you.But you know the problem:We can&#39;t make people rent to folks that they don&#39;t want to rent to.And besides, we have a great relationshipwith people in the communityand we really don&#39;t want to damage that.&quot;He said, &quot;So maybe this is what you should do.Why don&#39;t you let your family stay home,because you do know that you get a 30-day leave.So once a year,you can go home to your family,spend 30 days and then come on back.&quot;
时间： 2:58
zh-cn:毫无疑问，这不是我想要的结果。所以从少校那儿出来，我又去了人事部，找到之前那个职员，他说，“吉姆，我觉得我有个办法能帮你。有个士兵马上要退伍了，他有辆房车。不知道你注意过没有，在芒廷霍姆有许多房车公园，停满了房车。你可以把他的房车买下来，价钱应该好商量，因为他想尽快离开。这样就能解决你的问题了，也许是个不错的方案。我立刻上车，开到市区，找到了那辆房车，房车很小，但是在当时那种情况下，也许是最好的选择。于是我把房车买了下来。然后我问他，“我能把房车继续停在这儿吗？这样我所有问题就都解决了，还是说我要去另找一个房车公园？”他说，“我不确定，我要问问公园管理部门。”于是我返回基地，他给我回电话了，管理部门说，“不行，你不能把房车停在这，我们已经把这个车位让给别人了。”这让我觉得很奇怪，因为还有好几个车位是空的，而他恰恰就把这个车位让给别人了。
en:Needless to say, that didn&#39;tresonate for me.So after leaving him, I went back to personnel,and talking to the clerk,he said, &quot;Jim, I think I have a solution for you.There&#39;s an airman who is leavingand he has a trailer.If you noticed, in Mountain Home,there are trailer parks and trailersall over the place.You can buy his trailer,and you&#39;d probably get a really good dealbecause he wants to get out of townas soon as possible.And that would take care of your problem,and that would provide the solution for you.&quot;So I immediately jumped in my car,went downtown, saw the trailer —it was a small trailer,but under the circumstances,I figured that was the best thing that I could do.So I bought the trailer.And then I asked him, &quot;Can I just leave the trailer here,and that would take care of all my problems,I wouldn&#39;t have to findanother trailer park?&quot;He said, &quot;Before I say yes to that, I need to check with management.&quot;So I get back to the base,he called me back and management said,&quot;No, you can&#39;t leave the trailer herebecause we had promised that slotto some other people.&quot;And that was strange to mebecause there were several other slots that were open,but it just so happened that he had promised that slot to someone else.

zh-cn:那我怎么办呢，他说，“不用担心，吉姆，还有很多房车公园。”于是我又有了一份长长的清单，全是房车公园。我一家一家的去问，得到的都是拒绝的答复，就像我在找公寓的时候一样。除了说他们没有多余的车位外，他们还对我说过这样的话，一个人说，“吉姆，我之所以不能给你一个车位，是因为我们这个房车公园里已经有一家黑人了。”“我并不想这样，我是喜欢你们（黑人）的。”（笑声）当时我的反应也一样，我也笑了。他说，“问题是这样的：如果我让你搬进来，其他租客就会搬走，我的损失就大了。”他说，”所以我没法租给你。”
en:So, what I did —and he said, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t worry, Jim,because there are a lot of trailer parks.&quot;So I put out another exhaustive listof going to trailer parks.I went to one after another, after another.And I got the same kind of rejection therethat I received when I was looking for the apartment.And as a result, the kind of commentsthat they made to me,in addition to saying that theydidn&#39;t have any slots open,one person said, &quot;Jim, the reasonwhy we can&#39;t rent to you,we already have a Negro familyin the trailer park.&quot;He said, &quot;And it&#39;s not me, because I like you people.&quot;(Laughs)And that&#39;s what I did, too.I chuckled, too.He said, &quot;But here&#39;s the problem:If I let you in, the other tenants will move outand I can&#39;t afford to takethat kind of a hit.&quot;He said, &quot;I just can&#39;t rent to you.&quot;

zh-cn:虽然很让人沮丧，但我没有放弃。我继续找，我找到芒廷霍姆镇的一个角落，那里有一个小的房车公园。真的非常小。里面连路都没有，地面也没有铺砖，也没有围栏，将各个车位隔开。没有洗衣房。但我当时的遭遇让我没什么其他选择。我给我妻子打电话，说，“咱们就住到那儿去吧。”于是我们搬到了那里，成为了爱达荷州芒廷霍姆的居民。当然，我们最终安顿下来了。
en:Even though that was discouraging,it didn&#39;t stop me.I kept looking,and I looked at the far end of the town in Mountain Home,and there was a small trailer park.I mean, a really small trailer park.It didn&#39;t have any paved roads in it,it didn&#39;t have the concrete slabs,it didn&#39;t have fencingto portion off your trailer slot from other trailer slots.It didn&#39;t have a laundry facility.But the conclusion I reached at that momentwas that I didn&#39;t have a lot of other options.So I called my wife, and I said,&quot;We&#39;re going to make this one work.&quot;And we moved into itand we became homeownersin Mountain Home, Idaho.And of course, eventuallythings settled down.

zh-cn:四年后，我接到调令，离开爱达荷州芒廷霍姆，前往拉布拉多的古斯湾。又是个鸟不拉屎的地方，我都无力吐槽了。（笑声）我迎来了新的挑战，要把家人从爱达荷州芒廷霍姆，搬到宾夕法尼亚州沙龙。其实问题也不大，我们当时刚买了辆新车。我母亲给我来电话说要过来。她会跟我们一起搬家，在路上照顾孩子。于是我母亲过来了，她跟爱丽丝一起准备了食物在路上吃。
en:Four years after that, I received papersto move from Mountain Home, Idahoto a place called Goose Bay, Labrador.We won&#39;t even talk about that.It was another great location. (Laughter)So my challenge then was to get my family from Mountain Home, Idahoto Sharon, Pennsylvania.That wasn&#39;t a problem because wehad just purchased a brand-new automobile.My mother called and said she&#39;ll fly out.She&#39;ll be with us as we drive,she&#39;ll help us manage the children.So she came out, her and Alice put a lot of food together for the trip.

zh-cn:我们早上5点就出发了。旅途很愉快，我们一路上聊得很开心。差不多（晚上）6点半，7点的时候，我们觉得有点累了，我们商量，“还是找家汽车旅馆歇一晚，明天一早再继续赶路吧。”汽车旅馆很多，我们边开边找，然后看到一家，门口巨大的、闪亮的灯箱上写着，“有空房，有空房，有空房。”于是我们停下车。他们在停车场等着，我走进屋。在我进屋的时候，前台的女士刚刚给一些人办完入住手续，还有几个人跟在我后面也进了屋。于是我走到柜台前，那位女士问，“有什么能帮您的吗？”我说，“我和家人想要一间房过夜。”她说，“实在抱歉，刚刚那是最后一间房了。得等到明早才会有空房。”“如果你沿这条路再开45分钟到1小时，会有一个房车公园。”我说，“但你外面写着‘空房’的灯还开着，还闪呢。”她说，“哦，我忘了关了。”她凑过去把灯关了。我俩面面相觑。屋里还有其他人。她看了看其他人，鸦雀无声。我突然明白了，于是走出屋子，向停车场走去。我对我的母亲、妻子和梅兰妮说，“看来我们还得再往前开一段距离，才能找到地方睡觉了。”我们准备继续往前开，就在我发动车，准备开出停车场的时候，你们猜怎么着？灯箱又亮了。闪耀着，“有空房，有空房，有空房。”我们还是找到了一个不错的地方。虽然不是首选，但也安全和干净。所以那晚我们睡得很好。
en:That morning, we left at about 5 a.m.Great trip, having a great time, good conversation.Somewhere around 6:30, 7 o&#39;clock,we got a little bit tired,and we said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we geta motel so that we can restand then have an early startin the morning?&quot;So we were looking at a number of the motels as we drove down the road,and we saw one, it was a greatbig, bright flashing light that said,&quot;Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacanies.&quot;So we stopped in.They were in the parking lot, I went inside.When I walked inside,the lady was just finishing up one contract with some folks,some other people were coming in behind me.And so I walked to the counter,and she said, &quot;How can I help you?&quot;I said, &quot;I would like to get a motel for the evening for my family.&quot;She said, &quot;You know, I&#39;m really sorry,I just rented the last one.We will not have any more until the morning.&quot;She said, &quot;But if you go down the roadabout an hour, 45 minutes,there&#39;s another trailer park down there.&quot;I said, &quot;Yeah, but you still have the &#39;Vacancies&#39; light on, and it&#39;s flashing.&quot;She said, &quot;Oh, I forgot.&quot;And she reached over and turned the light off.She looked at me and I looked at her.There were other people in the room.She kind of looked at them.No one said anything.So I just got the hint and I left,and went outside to the parking lot.And I told my mother and I told my wifeand also Melanie, and I said,&quot;It looks like we&#39;re going to have todrive a little bit further down the roadto be able to sleep tonight.&quot;And we did drive down the road,but just before we took off and pulled out of the parking lot,guess what happened?The light came back on.And it said, &quot;Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacancies.&quot;We were able to find a nice place.It wasn&#39;t our preference,but it was secure and it was clean.And so we had a great sleep that night.

zh-cn:我想说的重点是我们从爱达荷到宾夕法尼亚这一路上，不断经历着相似的遭遇，就是不断地被旅店、汽车旅馆和餐厅拒绝。但我们还是到达了宾夕法尼亚。我们把家安顿好。有孩子在大家都很开心。我跳上飞机，飞到了拉布拉多的古斯湾，（之后的事）应该算另一个故事了，对吗？（笑声）
en:The piece that&#39;s important about thatis that we had similarkinds of experiencesfrom Idaho all the way through to Pennsylvania,where we were rejected from hotels, motels and restaurants.But we made it to Pennsylvania.We got the family settled.Everyone was glad to see the kids.I jumped on a plane and shot offto Goose Bay, Labrador,which is another story, right?(Laughter)

zh-cn:就这样，53年过去了，我现在有9个孙子孙女，2个重孙重孙女。其中有5个孙子。他们中有硕士、博士、有在读的大学生，还有一个在念医学专科。有一对准夫妇。差不多要结婚了，但是谁知道呢。（笑声）有一个在念大学，已经第八年了。（笑声）他还没拿到学位，但他想当个喜剧演员。我们都想让他留在学校。因为世事难料，不能说你在家里很搞笑，你就能当喜剧演员了吧？（笑声）重要的是，他们都是好孩子，没有人吸毒，没有人在高中就生小孩，也没有人犯罪。
en:Here it is, 53 years later,I now have nine grandchildren, two great-grandchildren.Five of the grandchildren are boys.I have master&#39;s, Ph.D., undergrad,one in medical school.I have a couple that are trending.They&#39;re almost there but not quite.(Laughter)I have one who has been in college now for eight years.(Laughter)He doesn&#39;t have a degree yet, but he wants to be a comedian.So we&#39;re just trying to get himto stay in school.Because you never know,just because you&#39;re funny at home,does not make you a comedian, right?(Laughter)But the thing about it, they&#39;re all good kids —no drugs, no babies in high school, no crime.

zh-cn:这就是我家的情况，有一天，我坐在电视房看电视，（电视里）在讨论发生在弗格森的枪击案和随之而来的动荡。突然，有一个新闻评论员出现在节目里，她说，“在刚刚过去的三个月里，有八位手无寸铁的非裔美国男性被警察、白人房东或者白人公民杀害。”当时我被这条消息深深震惊了。我说，“这都什么事儿啊？太疯狂了。多大的仇恨才会让人做出这样的事情？”
en:So with that being the backdrop,I was sitting in my TV room watching TV,and they were talking about Fergusonand all the hullabaloo that was going on.And all of a sudden, one of the news commentators got on the air and she said,&quot;In the last three months,eight unarmed African-American maleshave been killed by police,white homeowners, or white citizens.&quot;For some reason, at that momentit just all hit me.I said, &quot;What is it? It is so insane.What is the hatred that&#39;s causing people to do these kinds of things?&quot;
时间： 9:57
zh-cn:紧接着，我的一个孙子给我打电话。他说，“爷爷，你刚刚看电视了吗？”我说，“看了。”他说，“我不明白。我们都遵纪守法，但是看来作为黑人，我们开车走路，说话，都是危险的。那我们还能怎么办。我们做每一件事都是按您教我们的做的。当警察让我停车时，我把两只手都放在方向盘12点钟的位置。如果要查身份证，我会说，‘我会慢慢把手伸到手套箱里取我的身份证。’当我们被叫下车搜身，当我们被按在地上搜身，当我们的行李厢被打开搜查，我们不反抗，我们配合他们，因为你告诉过我们，‘不要跟警察对着干。完事之后，给我打电话，我会去找警察谈。’
en:Just then, one of my grandsons called.He said, &quot;Granddad, did you hearwhat they said on TV?&quot;I said, &quot;Yes, I did.&quot;He said, &quot;I&#39;m just so confused.We do everything we do,but it seems that driving while black,walking while black, talking while black,it&#39;s just dangerous.What can we do? We do everythingthat you told us to do.When stopped by the police,we place both hands on the steering wheelat the 12 o&#39;clock position.If asked to get identification,we tell them, &#39;I am slowly reaching over into the glove compartment to get my I.D.&#39;When pulled out of the car to be searched,when laid on the ground to be searched,when our trunks are opened to be searched,we don&#39;t push back, we don&#39;t challengebecause we know, you&#39;ve told us,&#39;Don&#39;t you challenge the police.After it&#39;s over, call us and we&#39;llbe the ones to challenge.&quot;
时间：10:51
zh-cn:他说，“有件事最让我不爽：我们的白人朋友，我的哥们，我们经常在一块玩。当他们听说这样的事时，他们说，“你怎么能忍？你应该反抗，应该斗争，应该让他们出示证件。”我是这样教我的孩子们回应的：“我知道你们可以这么做，但是当我们也在车上时，请不要这么做，因为这对你们可能没什么，但对我们而言，后果会非常严重。”
en:He said, &quot;And this is the piece that really bugs me:Our white friends, our buddies,we kind of hang together.When they hear about these kindsof things happening to us, they say,&#39;Why do you take it?You need to push back.You need to challenge.You need to ask them for their identification.&#39;&quot;And here&#39;s what the boys have beentaught to tell them:&quot;We know that you can do that,but please do not do thatwhile we&#39;re in the carbecause the consequences for youare significantly differentthan the consequences for us.&quot;
时间：11:22
zh-cn:作为一个祖父，我还能如何教我的孩子们？我如何保护他们的安全？如何让他们远离危险？后来有人问我，“吉姆，你生气吗？”我的回应是：“生气对我而言是一种奢侈，我也了解愤怒会带来什么后果。”
en:And so as a grandparent, what do I tell my grandsons?How do I keep them safe?How do I keep them alive?As a result of this, people havecome to me and said,&quot;Jim, are you angry?&quot;And my response to that is this:&quot;I don&#39;t have the luxury of being angry,and I also know the consequences of being enraged.&quot;
时间：11:50
zh-cn:所以，我唯一能做的事情，就是发挥我的全部智慧，将我的精力、想法、经历，全部用于反对种族歧视行为，无论何时何地，无论这种行为看起来有多不起眼。所以我要做的第一件事是教育孩子，第二件事是揭露种族歧视（现象），第三件事是在我有生之年，我会竭尽全力，采取一切手段消除种族歧视。
en:So therefore, the only thing that I can dois take my collective intellect and myenergy and my ideas and my experiencesand dedicate myself to challenge, at any point in time,anything that looks like it might be racist.So the first thing I have to do is to educate,the second thing I have to do is to unveil racism,and the last thing I need to dois do everything within my powerto eradicate racism in my lifetimeby any means necessary.
时间：12:21
zh-cn:关于第二件事我打算这么做：我想呼吁美国人民，呼吁他们的人性，他们的自尊，呼吁他们作为公民和国家所有者的尊严。不要用错误的方式来回应那些十恶不赦的罪行。而是要提高你们的社会知识水平，和社会意识水平，然后大家团结起来，齐心协力。让我们一起声讨和反对那些疯狂的行为，那些肆意践踏无辜生命的疯狂行为，无论受害者是哪个民族，哪个种族，什么血统。
en:The second thing I do is this:I want to appeal to Americans.I want to appeal to their humanity,to their dignity,to their civic pride and ownershipto be able to not react to these heinous crimes in an adverse manner.But instead, to elevate your levelof societal knowledge,your level of societal awarenessand societal consciousnessto then collectively come together,all of us come together,to make sure that we speak out againstand we challenge any kind of insanity,any kind of insanity that makes it okay to kill unarmed people,regardless of their ethnicity,regardless of their race,regardless of their diversity makeup.
时间：13:20
zh-cn:我们要反对这样的暴行，（因为）它荒谬至极。唯一可行的方法就是我们团结一致。我们要联合黑人和白人，亚洲人和拉美人，勇敢地上前一步，大声宣告，“我们不会容忍这样的行为再次发生了！”
en:We have to challenge that.It doesn&#39;t make any sense.The only way I think we can do thatis through a collective.We need to have black and white and Asian and Hispanicjust to step forward and say,&quot;We are not going to accept that kind of behavior anymore.&quot;
