zh-cn:在座的各位今天有没有想到过性？（笑声）哈哈，的确如此谢谢你们把手举起来在这里我为大家不堪的白日梦提供一些生物验证我要告诉你们一些事你不知道的有关野生动物的性生活
en:Anyone in the room thought about sex today?(Laughter)Yeah, you did.Thank you for putting your hand up over there.Well, I&#39;m here to provide you withsome biological validationfor your sordid daydreams.I&#39;m here to tell you a few thingsthat you might not have known about wild sex.

zh-cn:当人类想到性的时候男人和女人的形式这通常是他们首先想到的但上百万年来这样细致的分类从没存在过性是多个生物体之间的一种身体结合或是DNA的产生直到5亿年后我们才开始研究阴茎的结构产生DNA的物质阴道，以及毫无疑问，你们或许在想什么是属于我们的物种这种为人熟知的结构但是在动物界性别结构的多样性已经进化到可以应对环境繁殖所带来的多种因素这的确令人振奋不已
en:Now, when humans think about sex,male and female formsare generally what come to mind,but for many millions of years,such specific categories didn&#39;t even exist.Sex was a mere fusion of bodiesor a trickle of DNAshared between two or more beings.It wasn&#39;t until about 500 million years agothat we start to see structures akin to a penisor a thing that gives DNA out,and a vagina, something that receives it.Now invariably, you&#39;re probably thinking aboutwhat belongs to our own species,these very familiar structures,but the diversity that we see in sexual structuresin the animal kingdom that has evolvedin response to the multitude of factorssurrounding reproductionis pretty mind-blowing.

zh-cn:阴茎的多样性随处可见这是船艄（一种软体动物）是鱿鱼和章鱼的近亲公船艄会有一个交接腕那什么是交接腕？一种可拆分的、会游动的阴茎它会离开公船艄的躯体通过水中的信息素线索找到异性把自己吸附在异性身上储存精子几十年来，生物学家一直认为交接腕是一个完全分离的生物体貘是一种南美的哺乳动物它有一个可以盘卷东西的阴茎这个阴茎很灵活非常类似于我们的手它运用这种灵活性可以迂回阴道直接把精子储存在异性的子宫里更别说这是一个非常大的阴茎动物界最大的阴茎却不是貘的阴茎动物界最悬殊的阴茎身体比例是看上去可怜巴巴的海滩藤壶这个视频向我们展示了如果人类的阴茎也这么大的话会是什么样子（笑声）嗯嗯 （笑声）
en:Penile diversity is especially profuse.So this is a paper nautilus.It&#39;s a close relative of squid and octopus,and males have a hectocotylus.Just what is a hectocotylus?A detachable, swimming penis.It leaves the [body of the male],finds the female throughpheromonal cues in the water,attaches itself to her bodyand deposits the sperm.For many decades, biologists actually feltthat the hectocotylus was aseparate organism altogether.Now, the tapir is a mammal from South America.And the tapir has a prehensile penis.It actually has a level of dexterity in its penismuch akin to what we have with our hands.And it uses this dexterityto bypass the vagina altogetherand deposit sperm directly into the female&#39;s uterus,not to mention it&#39;s a pretty good size.The biggest penis in the animal kingdom,however, is not that of the tapir.The biggest penis-to-body-size ratioin the animal kingdom actually belongsto the meager beach barnacle,and this video is actually showing youwhat the human penis would look likeif it were the same size as that of a barnacle.(Laughter)Mm-hm. (Laughter)

zh-cn:鉴于结构的多样性有人会想为了能够成功地繁衍后代阴茎必须得很齐整地进入阴道如果仅仅是把A插入B槽口那就好办多了当然，这不太可能会发生因为我们不能仅仅只将形状大小考虑进去还得考虑功能的问题当提及性的时候功能与配子或精子和卵子做出的贡献密不可分但他们所做的贡献并不是对等的卵子并不容易产生这使得雌性在和谁分享卵子的事上非常挑剔另一方面，精子很多，显得廉价这使得雄性在考虑繁衍下一代时需要拿出性越多越好的策略
en:So with all of this diversity in structure,one might think, then, that penisesare fitting neatly into vaginas all over the placefor the purposes of successful reproduction.Simply insert part A into slot B,and we should all be good to go.But of course, that doesn&#39;t exactly happen,and that&#39;s because we can&#39;tjust take form into account.We have to think about function as well,and when it comes to sex,function relates to the contributions madeby the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs.And these contributions are far from equal.Eggs are very expensive to make,so it makes sense for females to be very choosyabout who she shares them with.Sperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap,so it makes more sense for malesto have a more-sex-is-better strategywhen it comes to siring membersof future generations.

zh-cn:那么动物是如何应对两性间这种不平衡的需求？我的意思是，如果雌性不局限于某个特定的同伴或是她有能力储存精子并且拥有的量已足那么她会做些其它生物活动躲避捕食者，培育下一代采集和消化食物这对那些还没把精子储存到雌性身体的雄性来说确实不是什么好事为了能够成功授精雄性们不得不使出一些策略这是臭虫在做爱这被恰如其分地称为创伤性授精雄性有一个尖尖的类似倒钩的阴茎他们通常直接插入雌性身体中而且并不刺入阴茎附近雄性把阴茎很随意地刺入雌性身体因此精子只是通过她的血淋巴进入卵巢如果雌性的刺伤很多或是这些刺伤受到感染的话她可能会因此死去
en:So how do animals copewith these very incongruentneeds between the sexes?I mean, if a female doesn&#39;t choose a particular male,or if she has the ability to store spermand she simply has enough,then it makes more sense for her to spend her timedoing other biologically relevant things:avoiding predators, taking care of offspring,gathering and ingesting food.This is, of course, bad news for any malewho has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank,and this sets the scene forsome pretty drastic strategiesfor successful fertilization.This is bedbug sex,and it&#39;s aptly termed traumatic insemination.Males have a spiked, barbed penisthat they literally stab into the female,and they don&#39;t stab it anywhere near her vagina.They stab it anywhere in her body,and the sperm simply migratesthrough her hemolymph to her ovaries.If a female gets too many stab wounds,or if a stab wound happens to become infected,she can actually die from it.

zh-cn:如果你在湖边悠闲自乐地散步看到鸭子们做爱你一定会感到很震惊因为这看起来像群奸老实说，事实的确如此一大群雄性会抓住一个雌性把她按下去然后不停地用自己螺旋状的阴茎向雌性同一形状的阴道射入精子一遍又一遍从一开始的疲软无力道后来的持续射精，这中间的过程不超过一秒但是雌性会赢得最后的胜利因为她可以转变自己的境况选择那些适宜的精子进入自己的卵巢
en:Now if you&#39;ve ever been out for a nice,peaceful walk by the lakeand happened to see some ducks having sex,you&#39;ve undoubtedly been alarmed,because it looks like gang rape.And quite frankly, that&#39;s exactly what it is.A group of males will grab a female,hold her down,and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penisinto her corkscrew-shaped vaginaover and over and over again.From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second.Now the female actuallygets the last laugh, though,because she can actually manipulate her postureso as to allow the sperm of certain suitorsbetter access to her ovaries.

zh-cn:现在我要和你们分享一些故事因为，我们人类总是认为性很好，性充满着乐趣充满着浪漫，充满着性高潮但直到6500万年后性高潮才随着哺乳动物的出现有所发展但是有些动物在此之前就有所变化有一些颇为原始的取悦异性的方法
en:Now, I like to share storieslike this with my audiencesbecause, yeah, we humans,we tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good,there&#39;s romance, and there&#39;s orgasm.But orgasm didn&#39;t actually evolveuntil about 65 million years agowith the advent of mammals.But some animals had it goingon quite a bit before that.There are some more primitive waysof pleasing one&#39;s partner.

zh-cn:雄性蠼螋的阴茎下部要么很大要么很小这是一种非常简单的基因遗传特性其他方面，雄性没有任何差别那些有着长长的阴茎下部的雄性看上去并不比其它的高大或是有着其它的不同根据生物理念我们或许认为雌性应当选择和那些阴茎下部比较小的雄性做爱这样她可以有更多的时间做其它事躲避捕食者，照顾下一代收集和消化食物但是生物学家多次注意到雌性会选择和那些阴茎下部较长的雄性做爱她们为什么这么做呢？好吧，根据一些生物学方面的专著“在交配过程中通过一些机械的或是刺激性的交互作用一些雄性的生殖器会运用雌性生殖系统使她们产生更为愉悦的反应。”嗯嗯
en:Earwig males have eitherreally large penile appendagesor really small ones.It&#39;s a very simple genetically inherited traitand the males are not otherwise any different.Those that have long penile appendagesare not bigger or strongeror otherwise any different at all.So going back to our biological minds, then,we might think that females should chooseto have sex with the guys thathave the shorter appendages,because she can use her time for other things:avoiding predators, taking care of young,finding and ingesting food.But biologists have repeatedly observedthat females choose to have sexwith the males that have the long appendages.Why do they do this?Well, according to the biological literature,&quot;During copulation, the genitalia of certain malesmay elicit more favorable female responsesthrough superior mechanicalor stimulatory interactionwith the female reproductive tract.&quot;Mm-hm.

zh-cn:这是墨西哥古比鱼你们可以从它们的上颌骨看到一个表皮细丝的分支这些细丝形成了一个鱼须我们已经注意到雄性会在交欢前把阴茎刺入雌性的生殖口我喜欢把它命名为“夏威夷神探假设”（《夏威夷神探》是美国的一部电视剧）雌性会更喜欢和那些有鱼须的雄性蹲在一起这是一个古比鱼的性爱录像
en:These are Mexican guppies,and what you see on their upper maxillais an outgrowth of epidermal filaments,and these filaments basically forma fish mustache, if you will.Now males have been observed to prodthe female&#39;s genital openingprior to copulating with her,and in what I have lovingly termedthe Magnum, P.I. hypothesis,females are overwhelmingly more likely to be foundwith males that have these fish mustaches.A little guppy porn for you right there.

zh-cn:为了赢得一个异性伴侣雄性会使用多种策略我们知道有一种强制策略使得性以一种强迫的方式与雌性发生关系还有一种取悦策略雄性会通过讨好异性来赢得她们的芳心不幸的是，在动物界强制策略最为常见在各个物种中都可以看到比如无脊椎动物、鸟类哺乳动物，甚至在灵长类也很常见
en:So we&#39;ve seen very different strategiesthat males are using when it comes towinning a female partner.We&#39;ve seen a coercion strategy in whichsexual structures are used in a forceful wayto basically make a female have sex.We&#39;ve also seen a titillation strategywhere males are actuallypleasing their female partners into choosing themas a sex partner.Now unfortunately, in the animal kingdom,it&#39;s the coercion strategy that we seetime and time again.It&#39;s very common in many phyla,from invertebrates to avian species,mammals, and, of course, even in primates.

zh-cn:有趣的是，在一些哺乳类物种中雌性进化出一些特定的生殖器使得性强迫无法发生母大象和母鬣狗有一个勃起的阴蒂或是一个外挂的扩大的阴蒂组织很像阴茎其实很难仅仅从外在区分这些动物的性别因此一个雄性在把自己的阴茎插入雄性的卵巢前雌性会把自己勃起的阴蒂伸出体外你可以想象，把一个阴茎放在另一个上面这事不太可能发生除非雌性同意更为有趣的是大象界和鬣狗界是一个母系社会它们有一群雌性带领着姐妹，姑姑阿姨，以及她们的子孙当年轻的雄性性发育成熟后就会被驱逐出群体在鬣狗界成年雄性的地位最低在猎杀中，他们总是排在最后甚至不如自己的后代由此可见，如果雄性没有了阴茎他就什么社会能力都没了
en:Now interestingly, there are a few mammalian speciesin which females have evolved specialized genitaliathat doesn&#39;t allow for sexual coercion to take place.Female elephants and female hyenashave a penile clitoris,or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally,much like a penis,and in fact it&#39;s very difficult to sex these animalsby merely looking at their external morphology.So before a male can inserthis penis into a female&#39;s vagina,she has to take this penile clitorisand basically inside-out it in her own body.I mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.It&#39;s simply not going to happenunless the female is on board with the action.Now, even more interesting is the factthat elephant and hyena societiesare entirely matriarchal:they&#39;re run by females, groups of females,sisters, aunts and offspring,and when young males attain sexual maturity,they&#39;re turfed out of the group.In hyena societies, adult malesare actually the lowest on the social scale.They can take part in a kill only aftereverybody else, including the offspring.So it seems that when you take the penis poweraway from a male,you take away all the social power he has.

zh-cn:那么今天我要告诉大家什么呢？性不只仅仅是把A插入B槽口然后子孙满堂我们在动物界看到的性策略和生殖结构告诉我们两性是如何相互作用的也告诉我们人口和社会如何形成并演变的
en:So what are my take-homemessages from my talk today?Well, sex is just so much morethan insert part A into slot Band hope that the offspring run around everywhere.The sexual strategies and reproductive structuresthat we see in the animal kingdom basicallydictate how males and femaleswill react to each other,which then dictates how populations and societiesform and evolve.

zh-cn:所以动物，包括我们自己花费很多时间想着性的问题一点不足为奇但让你们感到惊讶的是性会在多大程度上影响我们以及它们生活的方方面面
en:So it may not be surprising to any of youthat animals, including ourselves,spend a good amount of time thinking about sex,but what might surprise you is the extent to whichso many other aspects of their lives and our livesare influenced by it.
