zh-cn:我的名字是 Ursus Wehrli﹐今天我想和你们谈谈我的作品整理艺术首先 - 有什么疑问吗﹖首先﹐我必须说我不是来自这里而是来自一个文化完全不同的地方﹐你发现了吗﹖你瞧﹐我打着一条领带﹐然后﹐我有一点紧张因为我说的是外国话我想先为我接下来可能会犯的错误道歉毕竟我是从瑞士来的﹐希望你们不要觉得我说的是瑞士腔的德文这不过是一个瑞士人说美语所产生出来的声音但不用担心 - 美语对我来说没问题毕竟这是你们的语言﹐与我无关(笑声)真的﹐反正我结束TED演讲以后﹐我回瑞士就好倒是你还得继续留在这里讲这种语言(笑声)
en:My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morningabout my project, Tidying Up Art.First of all — any questions so far?First of all, I have to say I&#39;m not from around here.I&#39;m from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?I mean, I&#39;m wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I&#39;m a little bit nervousbecause I&#39;m speaking in a foreign language,and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.Because I&#39;m from Switzerland, and I just don&#39;t hope you think this is Swiss GermanI&#39;m speaking now here. This is just what it sounds likeif we Swiss try to speak American.But don&#39;t worry — I don&#39;t have trouble with English, as such.I mean, it&#39;s not my problem, it&#39;s your language after all.(Laughter)I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,and you have to go on talking like this all the time.(Laughter)

zh-cn:大会要求我到这里来朗读我的书书名是”整理艺术“如你所见这是一本图画书所以很快就读完了但既然我在TED﹐我决定用比较先进的方式来发表我的演讲以TED精神﹐我做了这些投影片我想在这里跟你们分享﹐像这样(笑声)说真的﹐我也准备了一些放大图片 - 这样更好
en:So I&#39;ve been asked by the organizers to read from my book.It&#39;s called &quot;Tidying Up Art&quot; and it&#39;s, as you can see,it&#39;s more or less a picture book.So the reading would be over very quickly.But since I&#39;m here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.I&#39;d like to show them around so we can just, you know —(Laughter)Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures — even better.

zh-cn:整理艺术﹐是一个非常新的名词你可能没有听过这是我这几年来的一点小兴趣一切都从美国艺术家 Donald Baechler 的作品开始我家里有一幅﹐我每天看着它过了一阵子我实在受不了这种凌乱这个家伙天天这样盯着我真为他感到抱歉我觉得甚至他自己也不是很舒服每天都看着这些乱七八糟的红方块于是我决定帮他一把把这些方块整齐地堆起来(笑声)我觉得他现在看起来没这么悲惨了有了这次的愉快经验以后﹐我开始更仔细地观察现代艺术我发觉﹐现代艺术的世界真是有混乱
en:So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that&#39;s a relatively new term.You won&#39;t be familiar with it.I mean, it&#39;s a hobby of mine that I&#39;ve been indulging in for the last few years,and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald BaechlerI had hanging at home. I had to look at it every dayand after a while I just couldn&#39;t stand the mess anymorethis guy was looking at all day long.Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.And it seemed to me even he felt really badfacing these unorganized red squares day after day.So I decided to give him a little support,and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.(Laughter)Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closelyat modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern artis particularly topsy-turvy.

zh-cn:让我给你一个好例子从一个非常简单的例子开始这是保罗·克利的作品我们可以很清楚的看到﹐颜色一篇混乱(笑声)他好像不知道怎么把不同颜色放在一起这里有这张作品的不同元素把它解构以后可能当时克利先生赶时间(笑声)可能他正在赶一班飞机我们可以看到他从桔色开始然后慢慢用完桔色颜料这里我们可以看到他稍微休息了一格现在看看经过我整理以后(笑声)我们可以看到在原本图画中看不到的十七个红色和桔色方块还有两个绿色方块捣乱很好不过那只是初级的整理罢了现在我们来看看比较复杂的图片(笑声)
en:And I can show here a very good example.It&#39;s actually a simple one, but it&#39;s a good one to start with.It&#39;s a picture by Paul Klee.And we can see here very clearly, it&#39;s a confusion of color.(Laughter)Yeah. The artist doesn&#39;t really seem to know where to put the different colors.The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture —the whole thing is unstructured.We don&#39;t know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean —(Laughter)— maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.We can see here he started out with orange,and then he already ran out of orange,and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.(Laughter)We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.Yeah, that&#39;s great.So I mean, that&#39;s just tidying up for beginners.I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.(Laughter)

zh-cn:怎么说呢﹖乱成一团所有东西都被随意的扔到这个空间里如果我的房间长这样的话我妈可是会惩罚我禁足三天的于是 - 让我来规范整理这张图画这真的是很复杂的(掌声)没错﹐有些人在这里会拍手但这是比较瑞士的方式(笑声)我们瑞士出名的有巧克力和起司﹐火车准时一切井井有条的时候我们才会快乐
en:What can you say? What a mess.I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.If my room back home had looked like this,my mother would have grounded me for three days.So I&#39;d like to — I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.And that&#39;s really advanced tidying up.(Applause)Yeah, you&#39;re right. Sometimes people clap at this point,but that&#39;s actually more in Switzerland.(Laughter)We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.We are only happy when things are in order.
时间： 4:47
zh-cn:让我们再举一些其它例子这是米罗的作品我们可以看到他画了一些线条和形状随便地把它们画在黄色背景上就像我们一边讲电话一边在纸上乱画的那些东西(笑声)这是我的(笑声)你可以看到我们节省了很多空间经济实惠又有效率米罗先生如果用这种办法的话﹐可以省下一半画面再画一幅
en:But to go on, here is a very good example to see.This is a picture by Joan Miro.And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapesand dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.And yeah, it&#39;s the sort of thing you produce when you&#39;re doodling on the phone.(Laughter)And this is my —(Laughter)— you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.It&#39;s more economical and also more efficient.With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.
时间： 5:24
zh-cn:我知道你们仍然有点存疑为了证明我的认真我带来了我申请的专利﹐这些作品的规格我特别在瑞士的专利协会为我整理艺术的手法申请了专利(笑声)让我念一段说明给你们听&quot;Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht —&quot;还没结束&quot;Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusenwird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunstdurch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeitendes allgemeinen Formenschatzesneue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird.&quot;
en:But I can see in your faces that you&#39;re still a little bit skeptical.So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works,because I&#39;ve had my working methods patentedat the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.(Laughter)I&#39;ll just quote from the specification.&quot;Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht —&quot;It&#39;s not finished yet.&quot;Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusenwird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunstdurch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeitendes allgemeinen Formenschatzesneue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird.&quot;
时间： 6:10
zh-cn:是﹐当然我也可以翻译﹐但你们也不会更了解的连我自己都不太懂﹐至少听起来不错我刚意识到介绍一个新点子的手法是很重要的所以有时专利是必要的我想做一个小小的试验在座的每个人都坐的很整齐现在大家举起你们的右手我们用来写字的那个手﹐除了左撇子以外然后﹐我数到三﹐现在看起来还很整齐当我数到三的时候你们就跟后面的那个人握手一﹐二﹐三(笑声)
en:Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.I&#39;m not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.I just realized it&#39;s important how one introduces new ideas to people,that&#39;s why these patents are sometimes necessary.I would like to do a short test with you.Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah.The right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.And now, I&#39;ll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.Now, I&#39;ll count to three, and on the count of threeI&#39;d like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK?One, two, three.(Laughter)
时间： 6:59
zh-cn:诚如所见﹐这就是个很好的例子﹕就算大家都秩序井然还是有可能造成完全的混乱我们可以从以下的例子里看到画的作者是 Niki de Saint Phalle在这里你看不清楚这些颜色和形状画的是什么经过整理以后﹐很明显﹐这是一个晒伤的女人在打排球(笑声)没错﹐这个更清楚这是 Keith Haring 的作品(笑声)我想没差这幅画的名字很好它就叫&quot;无题&quot;﹐取得真好
en:You can see now, that&#39;s a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic waycan sometimes lead to complete chaos.So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.And I mean, in the original it&#39;s completely unclear to seewhat this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.But in the tidied up version, it&#39;s plain to see that it&#39;s a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.(Laughter)Yeah, it&#39;s a — this one here, that&#39;s much better.That&#39;s a picture by Keith Haring.(Laughter)I think it doesn&#39;t matter.So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.It&#39;s called &quot;Untitled&quot; and I think that&#39;s appropriate.
时间： 8:00
zh-cn:于是经过整理以后﹐我们就可以看到这间 Keith Harding 五金行(笑声)用统计学的角度来看我们可以很清楚的看到这里有25个浅绿色的元素有一个是圆形这里有27个粉红色的方形﹐只有一个粉红弯形非常有趣﹐有人可以在所有 Harding 先生的作品上做一些统计分析看看画家在各个时期对浅绿圆形和粉红方形的偏好艺术家自己也可以从列出的清单中算出自己以后需要多少颜料(笑声)
en:So, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.(Laughter)This is Keith Haring looked at statistically.One can see here quite clearly,you can see we have 25 pale green elements,of which one is in the form of a circle.Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.I mean, that&#39;s interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysisto cover all Mr. Haring&#39;s various works,in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedureby using it to estimate how many pots of paint he&#39;s likely to need in the future.(Laughter)
时间： 8:46
zh-cn:你也可以把它们组合在一起Haring 的方形和 Kandinsky 的点点在把它加入克利的方形最后你就有一整个清单可以排列你将它们分类﹐建档﹐最后再全部放进档案柜里放进你的办公室﹐然后就可以以此为生了(笑声)就像我一样(笑声)其实也有几个艺术家是比较有条理的这是 Jasper Johns﹐我们可以看见他正在练习使用他的尺(笑声)
en:One can obviously also make combinations.For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky&#39;s dots.You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet,put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.(Laughter)Yeah, from my own experience. So I&#39;m —(Laughter)Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It&#39;s not too bad.This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.(Laughter)
时间： 9:27
zh-cn:但我仍然觉得他可以再更有条不紊一点把这些都加起来﹐你就可以这样做(笑声)我最喜欢的作品之一整理 Rene Magritte - 这真的很好玩你看(笑声)很多人问我是什么让我这样做的这必须要追溯到﹐我时常住在旅馆的那段时间有一次我有机会住在丽池五星旅馆你知道﹐那里有这些标语每天早上你可以放在门口”请整理房间“我不知道我在这里有没有事实上﹐我的房间不只是一天整理一次﹐是一天整理了三次过了一阵子我决定开个玩笑在每天离开房间里我都会故意四处乱扔些东西书﹐衣服﹐牙刷等等﹐很不错我每次回房间的时候一切都回归原位有一天早上﹐我在梵高的画上挂了这个标语(笑声)这个房间从1888年以后就没整理过了当我回来的时候﹐它变成了这样(笑声)至少现在可以吸地了(笑声)
en:But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.(Laughter)And here, that&#39;s one of my favorites.Tidying up Rene Magritte — this is really fun.You know, there is a —(Laughter)I&#39;m always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.And you know, there you had this little sign —I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,&quot;Please tidy room.&quot; I don&#39;t know if you have them over here.So actually, my room there hasn&#39;t been tidied once daily, but three times a day.So after a while I decided to have a little fun,and before leaving the room each day I&#39;d scatter a few things around the space.Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.(Laughter)And you have to say this room hadn&#39;t been tidied up since 1888.And when I returned it looked like this.(Laughter)Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.(Laughter)
时间：11:05
zh-cn:我可以了解为什么有些人会对某些特殊的图画特别有感觉觉得它需要整理﹐让我们做一个小测验这是 Rene Magritte 的图画现在你们可以在心中把它整理一下我想你们之中的有些人可能会把它整理成这样(笑声)是吗﹖但我比较喜欢把它整理成这样有些人会把它做成苹果派但这是一个很好的例子﹐说明这是一项非常费时的手工业你得把不同元素剪下来﹐再把它重新安排而不是像你们之中很多人想象的﹐用计算机做的不然它就会变成这样(笑声)
en:OK, I mean, I can see there are always peoplethat like reacting that one or another picturehasn&#39;t been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.This is a picture by Rene Magritte,and I&#39;d like you all to inwardly — like in your head, that is —to tidy that up. So it&#39;s possible that some of you would make it like this.(Laughter)Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.Some people would make apple pie out of it.But it&#39;s a very good example to see that the whole workwas more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming jobof cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.And it&#39;s not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,otherwise it would look like this.(Laughter)
时间：12:04
zh-cn:目前为止﹐我已经整理了很多我想要处理的图画就像这个 Jackson Pollock 的作品这很困难﹐真的过了一阵子﹐我决定一不做二不休把颜料全放回它们原来的地方(掌声)你也可以整理3D艺术像 Meret Oppenheim 的毛杯让它们回到原来的模样(笑声)真的﹐很棒﹐你甚至可以尝试如果你喜欢艺术的话﹐这是点彩画派的作品点彩画派便是所有画都是由点和像素组成的这是最适合整理的了(笑声)
en:So now I&#39;ve been able to tidy up pictures that I&#39;ve wanted to tidy up for a long time.Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.It&#39;s — oh, no, it&#39;s — that&#39;s a really hard one.But after a while, I just decided here to go all the wayand put the paint back into the cans.(Applause)Or you could go into three-dimensional art.Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.Here I just brought it back to its original state.(Laughter)But yeah, and it&#39;s great, you can even go, you know —Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.The pointillist movement is that kind of paintingswhere everything is broken down into dots and pixels.And then I — this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.(Laughter)
时间：13:21
zh-cn:这是点彩画派的创始人 Georges Seurat我把他的所有点都收集起来它们全在这里(笑声)你可以晚点把它们清点一下﹐如果你想要的话你知道﹐这就是整理画作的好处这是全新的﹐没有任何传统没有教科书﹐至少现在还没有这是“我们创造的未来&quot;(笑声)最后我们再看一个例子这是由 Pieter Bruegel 所画的广场你把每个人赶回家以后就变成这样(笑声)但或许你会自问那这些人都去了哪里﹖当然﹐他们还在。他们全在这里(笑声)我把他们堆了起来(笑声)
en:So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat,and I collected together all his dots.And now they&#39;re all in here.(Laughter)You can count them afterwards, if you like.You see, that&#39;s the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:it&#39;s new. So there is no existing tradition in it.There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.I mean, it&#39;s &quot;the future we will create.&quot;(Laughter)But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.That&#39;s how it looks like when you send everyone home.(Laughter)Yeah, maybe you&#39;re asking yourselveswhere old Bruegel&#39;s people went?Of course, they&#39;re not gone. They&#39;re all here.(Laughter)I just piled them up.(Laughter)
时间：14:32
zh-cn:嗯好﹐我差不多已经讲完了如果你想看其它例子﹐你可以到楼下的书店去买我很荣幸为你签名﹐你想要我签哪个画家的名字都可以(笑声)离开前我想给你们看一个东西最近我在做的新作品 - 和这个有关的也是整理我开始整理国旗你看﹐英国国旗可以变成这样(笑声)在我离去以前我是说﹐我想我最好赶快离开(笑声)这个真的很难﹐我没办法整理它我只好把它做得简单一点(笑声)非常谢谢打击(掌声)
en:So I&#39;m — yeah, actually I&#39;m kind of finished at that moment.And for those who want to see more, I&#39;ve got my book downstairs in the bookshop.And I&#39;m happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.(Laughter)But before leaving I would like to show you,I&#39;m working right now on another — in a related fieldwith my tidying up art method. I&#39;m working in a related field.And I started to bring some order into some flags.Here — that&#39;s just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.(Laughter)And then maybe before I leave you ...yeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.(Laughter)Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn&#39;t find a way to tidy that up properly,so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.(Laughter)Thank you very much.(Applause)
