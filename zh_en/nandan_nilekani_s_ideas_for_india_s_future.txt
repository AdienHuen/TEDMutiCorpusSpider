zh-cn:下面我来介绍一下印度以及印度人们观念的演变我觉得这是个很有意思的角度因为在每个社会中，尤其是开放的民主社会里只有观念树立之后，现实才能得以改变观念逐渐演变成意识形态然后出台相应政策，并最终付诸实践
en:Let me talk about Indiathrough the evolution of ideas.Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at itbecause in every society, especially an open democratic society,it&#39;s only when ideas take root that things change.Slowly ideas lead to ideology,lead to policies that lead to actions.

zh-cn:1930年，美国经历大萧条时期产生了有关国家社会安全问题的各种观点并促进了罗斯福执政期间其他事件的发生20世纪80年代的里根革命，放松了政府管制如今，全球经济危机的爆发引发了新规则的产生重新探讨国家应该如何执政所以说，观念改变国家
en:In 1930 this country went through a Great Depression,which led to all the ideas of the state and social security,and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt&#39;s time.In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation.And today, after the global economic crisis,there was a whole new set of rulesabout how the state should intervene.So ideas change states.

zh-cn:我们再来看印度四种观念对印度产生着巨大的影响第一种，在我看来是被我称为“已发生”的观念这些观念产生的影响造就了今天的印度第二种观念，我把它们称为“进行中”的观念这些观念已经被人们接受但尚未付诸实践第三种观念，我把它们称为“探讨中”的观念我们对这些观念进行争论争论在现实中是否应当实施这些观念第四种观念，也是我认为最重要的观念是“我们有必要预先考虑到”的观念因为作为一个发展中国家我们看着世界其他国家正在面临的问题由此可以事先预见到问题将产生的后果 并调整工作方式来避免这些问题
en:And I looked at India and said,really there are four kinds of ideaswhich really make an impact on India.The first, to my mind,is what I call as &quot;the ideas that have arrived.&quot;These ideas have brought together somethingwhich has made India happen the way it is today.The second set of ideas I call &quot;ideas in progress.&quot;Those are ideas which have been acceptedbut not implemented yet.The third set of ideas are what I call as&quot;ideas that we argue about&quot; —those are ideas where we have a fight,an ideological battle about how to do things.And the fourth thing, which I believe is most important, is&quot;the ideas that we need to anticipate.&quot;Because when you are a developing countryin the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having,you can actually anticipatewhat that did and do things very differently.

zh-cn:对印度来说，我认为有六种观念造就了今天的印度第一个是对“人民”这一概念的理解在六七十年代“人民”对我们来说是一种压力是一种负担如今，“人民”对我们来说是一种资本“人民”对我们来说是一种人力资源我相信，这种心态上的转变这种“人民”由负担向人力资源的转变可以说是印度人民思想上最根本的改变人力资源这一概念的转变体现在现实生活中就是印度正在享有的人口红利随着医疗体系的完善婴儿死亡率的下降生育率开始降低。印度所处的正是这一阶段印度会有很多高人口红利的年轻人出现在接下来的三十年里这种人口红利的独特之处在于印度将成为世界上唯一一个拥有人口红利的国家也就是说，印度将成为全球老龄化的趋势下唯一一个年轻国家这是非常重要的一点。 另外我们剖析印度人口红利的特点就会发现存在着两个人口曲线一个在印度南部和西部2015年将达到最高峰因为该地区的生育率已与西欧国家基本持平另外一个在印度北部它将成为未来人口红利的主体但这些人口红利就像人力资源的投资一样只有当人们接受良好教育身体健康，基础设施完善当他们上班道路畅通，夜晚学习灯火通明时只有在这些情况下，人们才能够受惠才能够从人口红利中受益换句话说，如果我们不对这些人口红利进行投入同样的人口红利有可能就变成人口祸患了因此，印度现在正处在关键的时候假如不是推动促进其人口红利就会走上人口祸患的道路
en:Now in India&#39;s case I believe there are six ideaswhich are responsible for where it has come today.The first is really the notion of people.In the &#39;60s and &#39;70swe thought of people as a burden.We thought of people as a liability.Today we talk of people as an asset.We talk of people as human capital.And I believe this change in the mindset,of looking at people as something of a burdento human capital,has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset.And this change in thinking of human capitalis linked to the factthat India is going through a demographic dividend.As healthcare improves,as infant mortality goes down,fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that.India is going to havea lot of young people with a demographic dividendfor the next 30 years.What is unique about this demographic dividendis that India will be the only country in the worldto have this demographic dividend.In other words, it will be the only young country in an aging world.And this is very important. At the same timeif you peel away the demographic dividend in India,there are actually two demographic curves.One is in the south and in the west of India,which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015,because in that part of the country, the fertility rate isalmost equal to that of a West European country.Then there is the whole northern India,which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend.But a demographic dividend is only as goodas the investment in your human capital.Only if the people have education,they have good health, they have infrastructure,they have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night —only in those cases can you really get the benefitof a demographic dividend.In other words, if you don&#39;t really invest in the human capital,the same demographic dividendcan be a demographic disaster.Therefore India is at a critical pointwhere either it can leverage its demographic dividendor it can lead to a demographic disaster.

zh-cn:第二点 印度改变了对于企业家的定义印度刚独立时 企业家被看作是一群剥削人民的败类但如今，60年后，随着创业者的涌现企业家已成为现实中的楷模对社会做着巨大贡献这一改变促进了整个经济体系的繁荣
en:The second thing in India has been the change inthe role of entrepreneurs.When India got independence entrepreneurs were seenas a bad lot, as people who would exploit.But today, after 60 years, because of the rise of entrepreneurship,entrepreneurs have become role models,and they are contributing hugely to the society.This change has contributedto the vitality and the whole economy.

zh-cn:我认为改变印度的第三个观念是我们对英语语言所持态度的改变之前 英语被认为是帝国主义者的语言但如今 全球化的背景下外包业务增加 英语语言帮助人们实现抱负成为了大家蜂拥学习的一技之长英语也逐渐转变成我们巨大的战略性资本
en:The third big thing I believe that has changed Indiais our attitude towards the English language.English language was seen as a language of the imperialists.But today, with globalization,with outsourcing, English has become a language of aspiration.This has made it something that everybody wants to learn.And the fact that we have English is now becominga huge strategic asset.

zh-cn:还有科技40年前，电脑给我们的印象是令人畏惧 充满威胁的人们会因此而失去工作今天 我们所在的国家每月销售八百万手机其中百分之九十是预付费手机因为人们没有信用记录预付费手机中的百分之四十每次充值少于20美分科技已经被大规模接受完全自由化，并被广泛应用因此 一开始被视作人类威胁并禁止使用的科技逐渐赢得了人们的认可20年前出台过一项有关银行计算机化的报告人们没有把这份报告命名为关于电脑的报告他们把电脑称为过账机他们不想让工会认为那是电脑后来他们想要使用更高级更强大的电脑时他们称其为高级过账机之后 我们经历了很多电话成为了一种赋权的工具并真正改变了印度人们看待科技的态度
en:The next thing is technology.Forty years back, computers were seenas something which was forbidding, something which was intimidating,something that reduced jobs.Today we live in a countrywhich sells eight million mobile phones a month,of which 90 percent of those mobile phonesare prepaid phonesbecause people don&#39;t have credit history.Forty percent of those prepaid phonesare recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge.That is the scale at whichtechnology has liberated and made it accessible.And therefore technology has gonefrom being seen as something forbiddingand intimidating to something that is empowering.Twenty years back,when there was a report on bank computerization,they didn&#39;t name the report asa report on computers,they call them as &quot;ledger posting machines.&quot;They didn&#39;t want the unions to believe that they were actually computers.And when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computersthey called them &quot;advanced ledger posting machines.&quot;So we have come a long way from those dayswhere the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment,and really has changed the way Indians think of technology.

zh-cn:另一方面现在的印度人民前所未有地适应着全球化的发展有200多年的时间 印度人民生活在东印度公司和帝国主义规则下他们对全球化的正常反应就是认为那是一种帝国主义但现在 很多印度公司往国外发展印度人们走出来 在世界各地工作他们增添了很多自信并且意识到 他们可以参与到全球化的进程中我们在人口上有优势因为我们是世界老龄化趋势下唯一的年轻国家这使全球化对印度人民来说有着更大的吸引力
en:And then I think the other pointis that Indians today are far morecomfortable with globalization.Again, after having lived for more than 200 yearsunder the East India Company and under imperial rule,Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalizationbelieving it was a form of imperialism.But today, as Indian companies go abroad,as Indians come and work all over the world,Indians have gained a lot more confidenceand have realized that globalization is something they can participate in.And the fact that the demographics are in our favor,because we are the only young country in an aging world,makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians.

zh-cn:最后一点 印度正在经历民主的不断深化当60年前 民主来到印度时那只是一小部分人的观点一小部分想把民主带进印度的人因为他们想为印度带来不一样的观点比如投票，议员，宪法等先进思想但现在 民主已经成为了从下向上的进程每个人都意识到拥有言论权的好处和开放社会的优势民主也就是这样深入人心的
en:And finally, India has hadthe deepening of its democracy.When democracy came to India 60 years backit was an elite concept.It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracybecause they wanted to bring in the idea ofuniversal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth.But today democracy has become a bottom-up processwhere everybody has realizedthe benefits of having a voice,the benefits of being in an open society.And therefore democracy has become embedded.
时间： 6:44
zh-cn:我认为这六个观念人力资源概念的产生印度企业家的发展英语语言成为人们的一技之长科技成为一种赋权的手段全球化开始发挥积极作用以及民主的不断深化—这些都促成了印度今天的进步今天这史无前例的快速发展
en:I believe these six factors —the rise of the notion of population as human capital,the rise of Indian entrepreneurs,the rise of English as a language of aspiration,technology as something empowering,globalization as a positive factor,and the deepening of democracy — has contributedto why India is today growingat rates it has never seen before.

zh-cn:话虽如此接下来我们来看“进行中”的观念这些观念在社会中已经没有异议但却无法得以实施有四种这样的观念一是教育问题由于某些原因，不管什么样的原因，我们缺少资金缺少优先重点，因为宗教有着更悠久的文化影响初等教育没有得到应有的重视但我觉得现在到了十分关键的时刻我们很遗憾地看到 政府的公立学校不能正常运行当下，孩子们只能去私立学校即使在印度的贫民窟超过一半的城市孩子都去私立学校所以学校正常运行是一个不小的挑战即便如此，每个人都极其希望穷人们也不例外，希望他们的孩子接受教育所以我认为 初等教育的观念已经深入人心 但还未得以实施
en:But having said that,then we come to what I call as ideas in progress.Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society,but you are not able to implement those things.And really there are four things here.One is the question of education.For some reason, whatever reason — lack of money,lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture —primary education was never given the focus it required.But now I believe it&#39;s reached a pointwhere it has become very important.Unfortunately the government schools don&#39;t function,so children are going to private schools today.Even in the slums of Indiamore than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work.But having said that, there is an enormous desireamong everybody, including the poor, to educate their children.So I believe primary education is an ideawhich is arrived but not yet implemented.
时间： 7:54
zh-cn:类似地，基础设施建设也是如此很长一段时间以来，基础设施建设都不予优先考虑去过印度的人们都有所体会这和中国的情况是完全不同的但现在 基础设施建设终于成为了人们达成一致并希望实施的观念这在官方声明中得以体现20年前的政治口号是&quot;Roti,kapra,makan&quot;意思是“食物，衣服和住所”现在的政治口号是&quot;Bijli,sarak,paani&quot;意思是“电力，水利和公路”这就是思想上的转变基础设施建设得到了肯定所以我相信 这个观念已经得到了大家的认同只是还没有落实而已
en:Similarly, infrastructure —for a long time, infrastructure was not a priority.Those of you who have been to India have seen that.It&#39;s certainly not like China.But today I believe finally infrastructure is somethingwhich is agreed upon and which people want to implement.It is reflected in the political statements.20 years back the political slogan was, &quot;Roti, kapada, makaan,&quot;which meant, &quot;Food, clothing and shelter.&quot;And today&#39;s political slogan is, &quot;Bijli, sadak, pani,&quot;which means &quot;Electricity, water and roads.&quot;And that is a change in the mindsetwhere infrastructure is now accepted.So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived,but simply not implemented.
时间： 8:32
zh-cn:第三件事是城市因为甘地重视农村而英国殖民者从城市统治因此尼赫鲁并没有把新德里当作典型的印度城市长久以来 我们忽视城市建设大家从现实生活中可以看出但现在 经历了经济改革和经济增长城市拉动经济增长城市提高创造力城市促进创新精神这些理论最终被人们所接受我觉得大家现在可以看到我们城市建设的趋势这同样也是 已被大家接受但还未实现的观念
en:The third thing is again cities.It&#39;s because Gandhi believed in villagesand because the British ruled from the cities,therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.For a long time we have neglected our cities.And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see.But today, finally, after economic reforms,and economic growth,I think the notion that cities are enginesof economic growth,cities are engines of creativity,cities are engines of innovation,have finally been accepted.And I think now you&#39;re seeing the move towards improving our cities.Again, an idea which is arrived, but not yet implemented.
时间： 9:09
zh-cn:最后一个概念 印度是一个单一的市场因为当你不把印度当作一个市场的时候你并不关心它是否单一 因为这并无所谓那你就面临着这样一个局面每个州有自己的产品市场每个省有自己的农业市场现在的政策税收 基础设施建设及其他政策正在逐步将印度作为一个单一市场所以国家内部现在也有着一个全球化的趋势这和国家外部的全球化同等重要这四个因素初等教育基础设施建设，城市化和单一市场在我看来 是印度已经接受 但未实现的观念
en:The final thing is the notion of India as a single market —because when you didn&#39;t think of India as a market,you didn&#39;t really bother about a single market, because it didn&#39;t really matter.And therefore you had a situationwhere every state had its own market for products.Every province had its own market for agriculture.Increasingly now the policies oftaxation and infrastructure and all that,are moving towards creating India as a single market.So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening,which is as important as external globalization.These four factors I believe —the ones of primary education,infrastructure, urbanization, and single market —in my view are ideas in Indiawhich have been accepted, but not implemented.
时间： 9:52
zh-cn:接下来就是探讨中的观念我们还为此进行争论的观念所进行的争论常常陷入僵局这些观念都有哪些呢？第一，我认为，是我们的意识形态由于印度种姓制度这一历史背景也由于众多印度人民一直被冷落很多政治工作都是为了确保落实这一点招致了不少异议和其他方法这和我们贴补人民的方式也有关也和我们两边的观点有关印度很多问题都是关于意识形态的关于种姓制度和其他事情这项政策逐渐陷入僵局这是需要解决问题之一
en:Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict.The ideas that we argue about.These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.What are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.Because of the historical Indian background, in the caste system,and because of the fact that there have been many peoplewho have been left out in the cold,a lot of the politics is about how to make surethat we&#39;ll address that.And it leads to reservations and other techniques.It&#39;s also related to the way that we subsidize our people,and all the left and right arguments that we have.A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideologyof caste and other things.This policy is causing gridlock.This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.
时间：10:36
zh-cn:第二点是我们的劳工政策现政策下 企业家很难在公司创造标准化职位因此 93%的印度劳工都是处于无组织的状态他们没有救济金 没有社会福利没有退休金 没有医疗保健 什么都没有这种现状必须改变 因为如果不能给人民提供规范的劳动制度最终将有大批人们受到剥削因此我们需要建立一套崭新的劳动法摆脱今天劳动法的繁复同时发布政策将更多的人们带入正规的行业并为上百万需要工作的人创造就业机会
en:The second one is the labor policies that we have,which make it so difficult forentrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies,that 93 percent of Indian laboris in the unorganized sector.They have no benefits: they don&#39;t have social security;they don&#39;t have pension; they don&#39;t have healthcare; none of those things.This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these peopleinto the formal workforce,you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws,which are not as onerous as they are today.At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector,and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for.
时间：11:17
zh-cn:第三件事是我们的高等教育印度的高等教育完全受到管制个人很难创办大学国外的大学也很难来到印度结果我们的高等教育很自然地不能满足印度的需要由此带来的很多问题值得我们关注
en:The third thing is our higher education.Indian higher education is completely regulated.It&#39;s very difficult to start a private university.It&#39;s very difficult for a foreign university to come to India.As a result of that our higher educationis simply not keeping pace with India&#39;s demands.That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address.
时间：11:38
zh-cn:但我相信 最重要的是我们需要预见的观念印度可以借鉴发生在西方的事发生在其他地方的事 并反思自己需要作出的努力首先 我们十分幸运现在的科技更加发达超过了其他国家发展时的科技水平所以我们可以利用科技来执政我们可以利用科技直接从中获益我们可以利用科技增加透明度 及其他好处
en:But most important I believeare the ideas we need to anticipate.Here India can look at what is happening in the westand elsewhere, and look at what needs to be done.The first thing is, we&#39;re very fortunatethat technology is at a pointwhere it is much more advancedthan when other countries had the development.So we can use technology for governance.We can use technology for direct benefits.We can use technology for transparency, and many other things.
时间：12:02
zh-cn:第二件事 是医疗保健印度人们有些严重的健康问题 比如心脏病晚期糖尿病晚期 肥胖症晚期所以我们不能简单地把一系列贫穷时期的疾病替换成一系列富足时期的疾病因此我们要重新审视我们看待医疗系统的方式我们需要一个战略这样我们才不至于走另一个极端
en:The second thing is, the health issue.India has equally horriblehealth problems of the higher state of cardiac issue,the higher state of diabetes, the higher state of obesity.So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseaseswith a set of rich country diseases.Therefore we&#39;re to rethink the whole way we look at health.We really need to put in place a strategyso that we don&#39;t go to the other extreme of health.
时间：12:26
zh-cn:同样地 现在西方社会里我们可以看到社会保障带来的问题社会福利的花费 医疗保险的花费 医疗辅助计划的花费因此对于一个年轻国家来说有机会从头建立一个现代退休金体系这样在年老的时候 就不会出现津贴问题
en:Similarly today in the Westyou&#39;re seeing the problem of entitlement —the cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid.Therefore when you are a young country,again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension systemso that you don&#39;t create entitlement problems as you grow old.

zh-cn:另外 印度负担不起环境污染的后果因为环境和发展是密不可分的给大家一个粗略的概念 世界每年消耗稳定在200亿吨对于9亿人口来说我们平均二氧化碳排放量每年达两吨印度已经达到每年两吨但如果印度以8%的速度增长2050年人均年收入将是现在的16倍所以我们说 收入增长16倍而二氧化碳排放不增长这样我们可以从根本上 改变对环境的态度对能源的态度以及我们创造国家发展的崭新范例
en:And then again, India does not have the luxuryof making its environment dirty,because it has to marry environment and development.Just to give an idea, the world has to stabilizeat something like 20 gigatons per year.On a population of nine billionour average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year.India is already at two tons per year.But if India grows at something like eight percent,income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050.So we&#39;re saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment,the way we look at energy,the way we create whole new paradigms of development.
时间：13:25
zh-cn:为什么这对大家很重要呢？为什么发生在一万英里以外的事情对大家很重要呢？第一，它重要是因为它代表着超过十万人民十万人民 也就是世界总人口的六分之一它重要是因为这是民主的体现以此证明增长和民主并不矛盾也是很重要的我们可以拥有民主 可以拥有开放的社会我们也可以拥有增长它的重要性也在于如果这些问题得以解决世界的贫困问题也将迎刃而解它的重要性还体现在这也是解决世界环境问题的关键点
en:Now why does this matter to you?Why does what&#39;s happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?Number one, this matters becausethis represents more than a billion people.A billion people, 1/6th of the world population.It matters because this is a democracy.And it is important to provethat growth and democracy are not incompatible,that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society,and you can have growth.It&#39;s important because if you solve these problems,you can solve the problems of poverty in the world.It&#39;s important becauseyou need it to solve the world&#39;s environment problems.
时间：14:03
zh-cn:如果我们真的想有所作为我们要真正设定二氧化碳排放的最高限度我们要真正降低能源的使用印度这样的国家需要解决此类问题如果我们观察西方200年来的发展其平均增长约为2%这里我们讨论的 却是增长率为8%至9%的国家这是有着很大区别的当印度以3% 3.5%的速度增长人口以2%速度增长时其人均收入每45年翻一番当经济增长率上升到8%人口增长率下降到1.5%人均收入每9年翻一番换言之 我们的确在加速进行着整个过程十亿人口逐步走上幸福的道路我们必须有一个清晰的策略这对印度极为重要 对世界也极为重要因为 我认为在座的你们也应该像我一样 关注这个问题非常感谢（掌声）
en:If we really want to come to a point,we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission,we want to really lower the use of energy —it has to be solved in countries like India.You know if you look at the developmentin the West over 200 years,the average growth may have been about two percent.Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent.And that makes a huge difference.When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percentand the population was growing at two percent,its per capita income was doubling every 45 years.When the economic growth goes to eight percentand population growth drops to 1.5 percent,then per capita income is doubling every nine years.In other words, you&#39;re certainly fast-forwarding this whole processof a billion people going to prosperity.And you must have a clear strategywhich is important for India and important for the world.That is why I think all of youshould be equally concerned with it as I am.Thank you very much.(Applause)
