zh-cn:有多少人在填写网页表格时需要识别像这样扭曲的词语？有多少人觉得很烦人？哇，不少呢。我就是发明这个的人。（笑声）或者说我是其中之一
en:How many of you had to fill out some sort of web formwhere you&#39;ve been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this?How many of you found it really, really annoying?Okay, outstanding. So I invented that.(Laughter)Or I was one of the people who did it.

zh-cn:这个称作验证码其理由是保证填写表格的是一个真人而不是什么电脑程序在操作可以不停地填写表格这是因为人类至少是没有视力问题的人可以识别这些扭曲的文字而机器做不到比如说在票务大全网站上你输入这些扭曲字符的原因是防止黄牛写一个电脑程序一次购买上万张票
en:That thing is called a CAPTCHA.And the reason it is there is to make sure you, the entity filling out the form,are actually a human and not some sort of computer programthat was written to submit the form millions and millions of times.The reason it works is because humans,at least non-visually-impaired humans,have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters,whereas computer programs simply can&#39;t do it as well yet.So for example, in the case of Ticketmaster,the reason you have to type these distorted charactersis to prevent scalpers from writing a programthat can buy millions of tickets, two at a time.

zh-cn:验证码在网络上普遍应用因其普遍性很多时候使用者就会看到一些异常搭配的文字排序这个例子来自雅虎注册网页使用者看到的这几个随机字母W，A，I， T，正好组成了“等”最有意思的是这是20分钟后的帮助页面文字：“帮忙！我已经等了二十多分钟，没有任何变化。”（笑声）这人以为网站让他等着当然还有更倒霉的
en:CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet.And since they&#39;re used so often,a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the useris not so fortunate.So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page.The random characters that happened to be shown to the userwere W, A, I, T, which, of course, spell a word.But the best part is the messagethat the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later.Text: &quot;Help! I&#39;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes, and nothing happens.&quot;(Laughter)This person thought they needed to wait.This of course, is not as bad as this poor person.

zh-cn:验证码计划是我们十多年前在卡内基梅隆大学做起来的并被广泛应用现在谈谈几年后我们做的一个项目算是验证码的新生代版本这个计划我们称之“reCAPTCHA”这个计划是从卡内基梅隆大学起步成为我们的启动公司一年半前谷歌收购了这个公司
en:CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago,and it&#39;s been used everywhere.Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later,which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA.This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA,which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon,then we turned it into a startup company.And then about a year and a half ago,Google actually acquired this company.
时间： 1:46
zh-cn:现在我来说说这个项目的初始这个项目是出于以下认识：每天全球范围内有大约2亿次验证码输入我头次听到的时候还挺自豪我想 我们的研究影响力不小啊接着我就感觉很难受因为每次你输入一个验证码你就浪费了10秒钟这个乘以2亿全人类每天就浪费了50万个小时来输入烦人的验证码我就很难受了
en:So let me tell you what this project started.So this project started from the following realization:It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAsare typed everyday by people around the world.When I first heard this, I was quite proud of myself.I thought, look at the impact that my research has had.But then I started feeling bad.See here&#39;s the thing, each time you type a CAPTCHA,essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time.And if you multiply that by 200 million,you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours every daytyping these annoying CAPTCHAs.So then I started feeling bad.
时间： 2:16
zh-cn:（笑声）
en:(Laughter)
时间： 2:18
zh-cn:我开始思考 既然不能放弃验证码因为网页安全依赖于此那么有什么方法可以利用它来做点好事呢？关键在于当你在10秒钟内输入验证码的时候你的大脑在做了不起的工作这是电脑目前尚无法做到的那么能不能让这10秒钟的工作变得有意义呢？也就是说有没有什么目前电脑无法解决的难题但是可以分割成10秒的单位小块这样每个人通过验证码解决这个问题的一个小单位？答案是肯定的话 这就是我们目前在做的
en:And then I started thinking, well, of course, we can&#39;t just get rid of CAPTCHAs,because the security of the Web sort of depends on them.But then I started thinking, is there any way we can use this effortfor something that is good for humanity?So see, here&#39;s the thing.While you&#39;re typing a CAPTCHA, during those 10 seconds,your brain is doing something amazing.Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do.So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds?Another way of putting it is,is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve,yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunkssuch that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHAthey solve a little bit of this problem?And the answer to that is &quot;yes,&quot; and this is what we&#39;re doing now.

zh-cn:也许你不知道 如今当你输入一个验证码不仅仅是在证明你是真人也是在把书电子化我来解释一下目前有很多书籍电子化的项目谷歌有一个。 “互联网档案”有一个现亚马逊的Kindle也有一个方法就是从一本旧书开始你见过书对吧？一本书？（笑声）首先扫描一本书
en:So what you may not know is that nowadays while you&#39;re typing a CAPTCHA,not only are you authenticating yourself as a human,but in addition you&#39;re actually helping us to digitize books.So let me explain how this works.So there&#39;s a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books.Google has one. The Internet Archive has one.Amazon, now with the Kindle, is trying to digitize books.Basically the way this worksis you start with an old book.You&#39;ve seen those things, right? Like a book?(Laughter)So you start with a book, and then you scan it.
时间： 3:18
zh-cn:扫描就是相当于把每一页照一张数码照片你就有了这本书每一页的照片这是一本书每一页文字内容的照片下一步就是电脑得解读这些照片上的每一个字这涉及到一个叫做OCR的技术也就是光学字符识别拍下一段文字的照片然后识别出文字内容问题是光学字符识别的技术并不能解决所有问题特别对于旧书墨水褪色，书页泛黄很多字OCR无法识别比如，五十多年前的书有百分之三十的单词电脑无法识别我们做的就是摘录出电脑无法识别的单词通过真人在网上输入验证码时阅读识别出来
en:Now scanning a bookis like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book.It gives you an image for every page of the book.This is an image with text for every page of the book.The next step in the processis that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image.That&#39;s using a technology called OCR,for optical character recognition,which takes a picture of textand tries to figure out what text is in there.Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect.Especially for older bookswhere the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow,OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words.For example, for things that were written more than 50 years ago,the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words.So what we&#39;re doing nowis we&#39;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognizeand we&#39;re getting people to read them for uswhile they&#39;re typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet.
时间： 4:01
zh-cn:下次当你输入一个验证码时，你输入的那个单词实际是我们电子化书籍里电脑无法识别的单词现在我们使用两个而非一个单词的理由是其中一个词是系统把一个电脑无法识别的单词提供给你因为系统不认识这个单词 所以无法判断你的答案我们就加入另一个单词一个系统已经认识的单词不告诉你哪个是已知的，哪个是未知的 请你将两者都输入如果你能拼写正确系统已认知的那个单词就判断你为真人这样对你输入的另一个单词就有所把握我们把这个过程让十个人重复进行如果他们对不识别单词的答案一致我们就得到了一个准确电子化的新单词
en:So the next time you type a CAPTCHA, these words that you&#39;re typingare actually words that are coming from books that are being digitizedthat the computer could not recognize.And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of oneis because, you see, one of the wordsis a word that the system just got out of a book,it didn&#39;t know what it was, and it&#39;s going to present it to you.But since it doesn&#39;t know the answer for it, it cannot grade it for you.So what we do is we give you another word,one for which the system does know the answer.We don&#39;t tell you which one&#39;s which, and we say, please type both.And if you type the correct wordfor the one for which the system already knows the answer,it assumes you are human,and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly.And if we repeat this process to like 10 different peopleand all of them agree on what the new word is,then we get one more word digitized accurately.
时间： 4:42
zh-cn:这就是这个系统的工作原理大约三四年前我们导入这个系统许多网站已经从旧的验证码换成新的来帮助书籍电子化而不是浪费人们的时间比如“票务大全”每次你在它的网站上购票 就在帮助把书籍电子化脸书：每次你加好友或者打招呼你就帮忙在把书籍电子化推特和其他350,000个网站都在用reCAPTCHA现在使用reCAPTCHA的网站是如此之多每天我们电子化的单词数量惊人大概是每天一亿这就是每年大概250万本书而这一切仅仅都是通过人们在网上输入验证码来做到的
en:So this is how the system works.And basically, since we released it about three or four years ago,a lot of websites have started switchingfrom the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their timeto the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books.So for example, Ticketmaster.So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster, you help to digitize a book.Facebook: Every time you add a friend or poke somebody,you help to digitize a book.Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA.And in fact, the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so highthat the number of words that we&#39;re digitizing per day is really, really large.It&#39;s about 100 million a day,which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year.And this is all being done one word at a timeby just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet.

en:Now of course,since we&#39;re doing so many words per day,funny things can happen.And this is especially true because now we&#39;re giving peopletwo randomly chosen English words next to each other.So funny things can happen.For example, we presented this word.It&#39;s the word &quot;Christians&quot;; there&#39;s nothing wrong with it.But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word,bad things can happen.So we get this. (Text: bad christians)But it&#39;s even worse, because the particular website where we showed thisactually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God.(Laughter)Oops.(Laughter)Here&#39;s another really bad one.JohnEdwards.com(Text: Damn liberal)(Laughter)So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday.

zh-cn:当然 不仅是人其他东西也难逃厄运 因为我们是随机选取的单词就有了很有趣的结果这个正在成为互联网上一个流行趋势无数的人参与这个所谓的验证码艺术肯定有人听说过是这样假设你在上网看到一个验证码你觉得很特别比如这个 （隐形的烤面包机）你要做的就是截图然后当然就是输入验证码因为你在帮我们电子化书籍接下来 你截了图就画出与它相关的图像（笑声）就是这样这样作品大概有一万个有些很可爱 （握紧它）（笑声）有些很好玩（大醉的创始人）（笑声）还有一些比如 “古生物学的史维凿”说不定那儿有史诺谱･道格（美国说唱歌手）
en:Now, of course, we&#39;re not just insulting people.See here&#39;s the thing, since we&#39;re presenting two randomly chosen words,interesting things can happen.So this actually has given riseto a really big Internet memethat tens of thousands of people have participated in,which is called CAPTCHA art.I&#39;m sure some of you have heard about it.Here&#39;s how it works.Imagine you&#39;re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHAthat you think is somewhat peculiar,like this CAPTCHA. (Text: invisible toaster)Then what you&#39;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it.Then of course, you fill out the CAPTCHAbecause you help us digitize a book.But then, first you take a screen shot,and then you draw something that is related to it.(Laughter)That&#39;s how it works.There are tens of thousands of these.Some of them are very cute. (Text: clenched it)(Laughter)Some of them are funnier.(Text: stoned founders)(Laughter)And some of them,like paleontological shvisle,they contain Snoop Dogg.

zh-cn:这是我最喜欢的reCAPTCHA数字这是我最喜欢的这个项目的部分这个数字是通过reCAPTCHA帮助我们电子化书籍中单词的人数7.5亿多于世界总人口的十分之一的人们帮助我们电子化人类的知识正是这样的数字激励我的研究进程那激励我研究进程的问题如下：试想人类的大型成就人类共同创造的那些大型历史性事物－比如 建造埃及金字塔开凿巴拿马运河或者把人类送上月球－这些工程都有个奇怪的事实就是它们基本都是由一样数量的人们完成的这很奇怪 这些工程都是由大概十万人完成因为在互联网出现之前整合十万人这十万人的巨大酬劳基本上是无法支付的但是有了互联网 刚刚展示的这个项目就找到了7.5亿人来帮助我们电子化人类知识那么 激励我的研究的问题就是如果十万人能把一个人送上月球一亿人能做到什么呢？
en:Okay, so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA.So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project.This is the number of distinct peoplethat have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA:750 million,which is a little over 10 percent of the world&#39;s population,has helped us digitize human knowledge.And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda.So the question that motivates my research is the following:If you look at humanity&#39;s large-scale achievements,these really big thingsthat humanity has gotten together and done historically —like for example, building the pyramids of Egyptor the Panama Canalor putting a man on the Moon —there is a curious fact about them,and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people.It&#39;s weird; they were all done with about 100,000 people.And the reason for that is because, before the Internet,coordinating more than 100,000 people,let alone paying them, was essentially impossible.But now with the Internet, I&#39;ve just shown you a projectwhere we&#39;ve gotten 750 million peopleto help us digitize human knowledge.So the question that motivates my research is,if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000,what can we do with 100 million?

zh-cn:基于这个问题我们有很多项目在进行中下面介绍一个最令我兴奋的项目这是过去一年半里我们低调进行的一个项目还没有真正投入使用 它叫做Duolingo因为我们还没有投入使用 嘘！（笑声）我相信你们都会保密的这个项目是这样开始的它始于我向我的一名研究生提的问题塞韦林･骇客这就是他我向他提了一个问题另外你确实没听错他姓骇客我向他提了个问题：怎么才能找到一亿人把互联网上的内容免费翻译成所有的主要语言？
en:So based on this question,we&#39;ve had a lot of different projects that we&#39;ve been working on.Let me tell you about one that I&#39;m most excited about.This is something that we&#39;ve been semi-quietly working onfor the last year and a half or so.It hasn&#39;t yet been launched. It&#39;s called Duolingo.Since it hasn&#39;t been launched, shhhhh!(Laughter)Yeah, I can trust you&#39;ll do that.So this is the project. Here&#39;s how it started.It started with me posing a question to my graduate student,Severin Hacker.Okay, that&#39;s Severin Hacker.So I posed the question to my graduate student.By the way, you did hear me correctly;his last name is Hacker.So I posed this question to him:How can we get 100 million peopletranslating the Web into every major language for free?
时间： 9:05
zh-cn:这个问题有好几个方面首先是翻译网页现在的网页内容主要分为几大语言其中一个大的分支是英语如果你不会英语就无法使用但是还有其他几种不同的语言如果你不会那几种也无法使用我打算把所有网页 大部分网页翻译成主要语言这是我想做的
en:Okay, so there&#39;s a lot of things to say about this question.First of all, translating the Web.So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages.A large fraction of it is in English.If you don&#39;t know any English, you can&#39;t access it.But there&#39;s large fractions in other different languages,and if you don&#39;t know those languages, you can&#39;t access it.So I would like to translate all of the Web, or at least most of the Web,into every major language.So that&#39;s what I would like to do.
时间： 9:28
zh-cn:也许有人会说 怎么不用电脑翻译？为什么我们不用机器翻译？机器翻译已经在应用中为什么不用它来翻译所有网页呢？问题就是机器翻译还不够好也许将来的15到20年内都不行机器翻译有很多错误甚至就算它翻对的时候因为它的错误率太高 你也不敢相信它
en:Now some of you may say, why can&#39;t we use computers to translate?Why can&#39;t we use machine translation?Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there.Why can&#39;t we use it to translate the whole Web?Well the problem with that is that it&#39;s not yet good enoughand it probably won&#39;t be for the next 15 to 20 years.It makes a lot of mistakes.Even when it doesn&#39;t make a mistake,since it makes so many mistakes, you don&#39;t know whether to trust it or not.
时间： 9:48
zh-cn:比如这个例子是由机器翻译的这是个论坛帖子有人提了关于Java语言的一个问题是从日语翻译成英语你可以读一下他首先道歉这是机器翻译的内容下一个句子开始涉及问题他开始说明记住 这个问题是关于Java语言的（文字：常常，山羊时间启动错误被吐出来）（笑声）接下来是问题的第一部分（文字：有多少次像风，像杆子，像龙？）（笑声）接下来是最好玩的部分（文字：这是对父亲的石头的侮辱？）（笑声）接下来是结尾 我最喜欢的部分（文字：请为你的愚蠢道歉，很多谢谢）（笑声）可见 机器翻译 还不够好回到问题上去
en:So let me show you an exampleof something that was translated with a machine.Actually it was a forum post.It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript.It was translated from Japanese into English.So I&#39;ll just let you read.This person starts apologizingfor the fact that it&#39;s translated with a computer.So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question.So he&#39;s just explaining something.Remember, it&#39;s a question about JavaScript.(Text: At often, the goat-time install a error is vomit.)(Laughter)Then comes the first part of the question.(Text: How many times like the wind, a pole, and the dragon?)(Laughter)Then comes my favorite part of the question.(Text: This insult to father&#39;s stones?)(Laughter)And then comes the ending, which is my favorite part of the whole thing.(Text: Please apologize for your stupidity. There are a many thank you.)(Laughter)Okay, so computer translation, not yet good enough.So back to the question.
时间：10:53
zh-cn:我们需要人来翻译所有网页下一个问题是为什么不付钱找人做呢？我们可以找专业翻译人员来翻译整个网页可以这么做但是 这会无比昂贵比如 翻译互联网很小很小的一个部分 维基百科英语翻译成西班牙语维基百科有西班牙语但是相比英语部分小多了大概是英语内容的百分之二十如果我们把剩下的百分之八十翻译成英语就得至少五千万美元－这还是在最便宜的服务外包国家所以这个方法很昂贵我们要的是一亿人免费把网页内容翻译成所有主要语言
en:So we need people to translate the whole Web.So now the next question you may have is,well why can&#39;t we just pay people to do this?We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web.We could do that.Unfortunately, it would be extremely expensive.For example, translating a tiny, tiny fraction of the whole Web, Wikipedia,into one other language, Spanish.Wikipedia exists in Spanish,but it&#39;s very small compared to the size of English.It&#39;s about 20 percent of the size of English.If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish,it would cost at least 50 million dollars —and this is at even the most exploited, outsourcing country out there.So it would be very expensive.So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million peopletranslating the Web into every major languagefor free.
时间：11:35
zh-cn:如果你要这么做的话就会意识到面临两个非常巨大的障碍首先是缺乏掌握双语的人我甚至不知道是否有一亿个互联网使用者掌握双语来进行翻译这是个大问题另一个问题是缺少鼓励机制怎么才能让人们甘愿免费翻译网页？通常你得付钱请人干活儿那么怎么才能让他们无偿劳动呢？当我们着手考虑这个项目的时候这是拦在面前的两大问题后来我们意识到有一个方法可以一举解决这两个问题一箭双雕这就是把翻译转化成无数人想做的事情同时解决双语人员人手不够的问题这就是语言学习
en:Now if this is what you want to do,you pretty quickly realize you&#39;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles,two big obstacles.The first one is a lack of bilinguals.So I don&#39;t even knowif there exists 100 million people out there using the Webwho are bilingual enough to help us translate.That&#39;s a big problem.The other problem you&#39;re going to run into is a lack of motivation.How are we going to motivate peopleto actually translate the Web for free?Normally, you have to pay people to do this.So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free?Now when we were starting to think about this, we were blocked by these two things.But then we realized, there&#39;s actually a wayto solve both these problems with the same solution.There&#39;s a way to kill two birds with one stone.And that is to transform language translationinto something that millions of people want to do,and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals,and that is language education.

zh-cn:当今有超过12亿人口在学习外语人们迫切得想学习外语而且这不是学校里不得不做的功课比如在美国有超过五百万的人在为外语学习软件每人支付超过五百美元所有人们非常想学外语过去一年半里我们建立的新网站叫做Duolingo－就是基于这个让人们免费学习外语同时翻译网页的想法就是让他们学以致用
en:So it turns out that today,there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language.People really, really want to learn a foreign language.And it&#39;s not just because they&#39;re being forced to do so in school.For example, in the United States alone,there are over five million people who have paid over $500for software to learn a new language.So people really, really want to learn a new language.So what we&#39;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website —it&#39;s called Duolingo —where the basic idea is people learn a new language for freewhile simultaneously translating the Web.And so basically they&#39;re learning by doing.
时间：12:55
zh-cn:使用方法是这样如果你是个新手 我们会给出非常非常简单的句子网页上有很多简单的句子我们给出非常简单的句子以及句中单词释义然后你翻译一下 并且可以看到别人是如何翻译的这样学习外语当你级别提高后我们会给出越来越复杂的句子让你翻译这整个过程 你都是边学边用
en:So the way this worksis whenever you&#39;re a just a beginner, we give you very, very simple sentences.There&#39;s, of course, a lot of very simple sentences on the Web.We give you very, very simple sentencesalong with what each word means.And as you translate them, and as you see how other people translate them,you start learning the language.And as you get more and more advanced,we give you more and more complex sentences to translate.But at all times, you&#39;re learning by doing.
时间：13:17
zh-cn:这个方法令人疯狂之处是它居然确实有效首先 人们可以通过它学外语我们建完了网站，它现正在测试中人们可以用它学习外语完全可以跟外语学习软件媲美所以用它确实可以学外语不仅可以学好而且更有趣味性因为通过Duolingo人们学的是真正的语言使用内容而不是编造的句子通过学习真正的文本内容，趣味性大大提高这样人们就实实在在学习外语
en:Now the crazy thing about this methodis that it actually really works.First of all, people are really, really learning a language.We&#39;re mostly done building it, and now we&#39;re testing it.People really can learn a language with it.And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software.So people really do learn a language.And not only do they learn it as well,but actually it&#39;s way more interesting.Because you see with Duolingo, people are actually learning with real content.As opposed to learning with made-up sentences,people are learning with real content, which is inherently interesting.So people really do learn a language.
时间：13:46
zh-cn:最令人惊讶的是网站使用者的翻译甚至是初学者的翻译和专业的翻译人员几乎不相上下这很让人惊讶让我给你们看一个例子这是一个从德语翻译成英语的例子上面是德语中间是一名专业英语翻译人员翻译的句子一个词二十美分的价钱下面是Duolingo使用者的翻译他们在使用该网站前不会任何德语可以看到 几乎很完美当然 为了让翻译达到专业水准我们也想了个办法我们把多名翻译者的翻译结合起来得到专业人员的水准
en:But perhaps more surprisingly,the translations that we get from people using the site,even though they&#39;re just beginners,the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators,which is very surprising.So let me show you one example.This is a sentence that was translated from German into English.The top is the German.The middle is an English translationthat was done by somebody who was a professional English translatorwho we paid 20 cents a word for this translation.And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo,none of whom knew any Germanbefore they started using the site.You can see, it&#39;s pretty much perfect.Now of course, we play a trick hereto make the translations as good as professional language translators.We combine the translations of multiple beginnersto get the quality of a single professional translator.
时间：14:29
zh-cn:即使我们要结合翻译这个网站仍然可以迅速翻译让我展示一下这是我们对维基百科翻译工程的预计从英语翻译成西班牙语要记住 这可是价值五千万美元的工程如果要把维基百科从英文翻译成西班牙语十万名活跃用户可以在五周内完成一百万活跃用户可以在八十小时内完成现在我们的项目小组已经有了上百万使用者我们希望可以以极快的速度进行这个翻译工程
en:Now even though we&#39;re combining the translations,the site actually can translate pretty fast.So let me show you,this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipediafrom English into Spanish.Remember, this is 50 million dollars-worth of value.So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish,we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users.And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users.Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users,we&#39;re hopeful that we&#39;ll be able to translateextremely fast with this project.

zh-cn:现在我对Duolingo最兴奋的就是它为外语教育创造了一个公平的商业模式是这样：目前外语教育的商业模式是学生付钱主要就是学生购买罗赛塔石碑五百美元的软件（笑声）这是目前的商业模式这个模式的问题是世界人口的百分之九十五没有五百美元所以这个模式对穷人极度不公平这是个面向富人的模式而Duolingo因为你学习的时候也创造价值，你在翻译东西－因为比如我们得付钱给人翻译东西这样你的学习过程就货币化了因为人们学习的时候同时创造价值他们就不用付钱 而是付出时间最妙的是 虽然人们得付出时间但这个时间是他们学习外语无论如何都会付出的那部分时间所以Duolingo做的好事就是提供了一个公平的商业模式－这个模式对穷人一样敞开机会
en:Now the thing that I&#39;m most excited about with Duolingois I think this provides a fair business model for language education.So here&#39;s the thing:The current business model for language educationis the student pays,and in particular, the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars.(Laughter)That&#39;s the current business model.The problem with this business modelis that 95 percent of the world&#39;s population doesn&#39;t have 500 dollars.So it&#39;s extremely unfair towards the poor.This is totally biased towards the rich.Now see, in Duolingo,because while you learnyou&#39;re actually creating value, you&#39;re translating stuff —which for example, we could charge somebody for translations.So this is how we could monetize this.Since people are creating value while they&#39;re learning,they don&#39;t have to pay their money, they pay with their time.But the magical thing here is that they&#39;re paying with their time,but that is time that would have had to have been spent anywayslearning the language.So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model —one that doesn&#39;t discriminate against poor people.
