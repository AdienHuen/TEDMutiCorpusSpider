zh-cn:在座任何人有没有接触过催泪瓦斯？有么？我感到很抱歉， 你可能知道那是一个致命的物质但是你可能不知道它是个很简单的分子有一个读不出来的名字它叫 “chlorobenzalmalononitrile&quot;我成功了它有几十年的历史，但是最近开始流行于全球的警察机关。以我自己的经验，一个非自愿的吸入者催泪瓦斯有两个非常不一样的用处第一，它可以灼伤你的眼睛第二，它可以帮你睁开它们
en:Has anyone among youever been exposed to tear gas?Tear gas? Anyone?I&#39;m sorry to hear that, so you might knowthat it&#39;s a very toxic substance,but you might not knowthat it&#39;s a very simple moleculewith an unpronouncable name:it&#39;s called chlorobenzalmalononitrile.I made it.It&#39;s decades old, but it&#39;s becomingvery trendy among police forcesaround the planet lately, it seems,and according to my experienceas a non-voluntary breather of it,tear gas has two mainbut quite opposite effects.One, it can really burn your eyes,and two, it can alsohelp you to open them.

zh-cn:催泪瓦斯确实帮助我看到了一些事情这就是在这个下午我想和你们分享的网络上的独立直播媒体可以改变新闻业在行动主义和政治演讲方面的力量。
en:Tear gas definitely helpedto open mine to somethingthat I want to sharewith you this afternoon:that livestreaming the powerof independent broadcasts through the webcan be a game-changer in journalism,in activism, and as I see it,in the political discourse as well.

zh-cn:在2011早年，我开始有了这个想法当我在圣保罗报导一个抗议一个关于大麻的示威游行一群人希望可以合法化印度大麻的使用当这个组织开始走的时候防爆警察从后面用橡皮子弹，炸弹和那些催泪瓦斯阻止。为了长话短说我参加了那个游行，以在一个完建的杂志社主编，我在那工作了11年但是感谢催泪瓦斯的效果我离开了那个杂志社，以新的方式去分享这些经历，和亲生体验的感觉。
en:That idea started to dawn on me in early 2011when I was coveringa protest in São Paulo.It was the marijuana march,a gathering of people askingfor the legalization of cannabis.When that group started to move,the riot police came from the backwith rubber bullets, bombs,and then the gas.But to make a long story short,I had entered that protestas the editor-in-chiefof a well-established printed magazinewhere I&#39;d worked for 11 years,and thanks to this unsolicitedeffects of tear gas,I left it as a journalist that was nowcommitted to new waysof sharing the raw experienceof what it&#39;s like to be there, actually.

zh-cn:所以在接下来的几星期，我回到了街道但是这一次，我不再是记者我以一个独立直播者的身份，我的设备都是借来的一个非常简单的相机和拥有3G调制解调器的背包我还有一个可以在任何交友平台分享的网址可以放在任何网页上在那个时候，游行平静的进行着没有任何暴力没有动作场景但是我发现一些特别兴奋的事情因为在远处我可以看到一些电视台在做报道他们用着很大的面包车，很多人和摄像机而我做着同样的事情但只用了一个背包。这对一个记者是个很高兴的事情但是最有趣的是，当我回到家我才发现我被90,000多人看着我收到了几百张电子邮件或者信息问我我是怎么做到的。怎么可能做到这样的事。
en:So in the following week,I was back in the streets,but that time, I wasn&#39;t a memberof any media outlet anymore.I was there as an independentlivestreamer, and all I had with mewas basically borrowed equipment.I had a very simple cameraand a backpack with 3G modems.And I had this weblinkthat could be shared through social media,could be put in any website,and that time,the protest went along fine.There was no violence.There was no action scenes.But there was something really exciting,because I could see at a distancethe TV channels covering it,and they had these big vansand the teams and the cameras,and I was basically doing the same thingand all I had was a backpack.And that was reallyexciting to a journalist,but the most interesting partwas when I got back home, actually,because I learned that I had been watchedby more than 90,000 people,and I got hundreds of emails and messagesof people asking me, basically,how did I do it,how it was possible to do such a thing.
时间： 3:27
zh-cn:我还学到， 我的直播实际上是第一个直播游行在街道上在巴西这个确实让我很吃惊我并非极客，也不是技术宅，那些设备我已经拥有而且非常容易得到我才发现，我们有一个边界一个非常重要的但是只要我们转换一下视角就会发现我们可以利用网络网络已经是一个巨大，难以控制的平台让非政府的电视频道，电视广播和任何有基本技术和设备的人甚至让我这种有小小结巴的人用。所以，如果它发生了，原谅我好么让我这样的人当上了主播这个想法对我来说是革命的
en:And I learned something else,that that was actually the first timethat somebody had ever donea livestreaming in a street protestin the country.And that really shocked me,because I was no geek,I was no technology guy,and all the equipment neededwas already there,was easily available.And I realized thatwe had a frontier here,a very important one,that it was just a matterof changing the perspective,and the web could be actually used,already used, as a colossaland uncontrollableand highly anarchical TV channel,TV network,and anyone with very basic skillsand very basic equipment,even someone like me who had thislittle stuttering issue,so if it happens, bear with me please,even someone like mecould become a broadcaster.And that sounded revolutionary in my mind.
时间： 4:28
zh-cn:所以在接下来的几年里我开始试验各种不一样的直播不只是在街道上，还有演播室和家中知道去年，2013年的开头我成立了一个叫 MedIa NINJA 的组织NINJIA是一个首字母缩略词意为“自由独立叙述播报者”(巴西语）或者用英文就是“独立叙述者”，报导者和行动它是一个没有任何媒体计划的媒体组织我们没有任何的经济来源我们也没有规划从中获利不过确实很明智，因为在这个时代想赚钱就不该做记者但是我们有着非常坚定和明确的目的我们知道在这个高度链接的社会媒体环境中可以让我们形成一个遍布全国的记者网络所以我们先注册了脸谱网的页面，然后做了声明开始用简单的方式报道街道
en:So for the next couple of years,I started to experiment withlivestreaming in different ways,not only in the streetsbut mostly in studios and in homes,until the beginning of 2013, last year,when I became the cofounder of a groupcalled Mídia NINJA.NINJA is an acronymthat stands for Narrativas Independentes Jornalismo e Ação,or in English, independent narratives,journalism, and action.It was a media groupthat had little media plan.We didn&#39;t have any financial structure.We were not planningto make money out of this,which was wise, because you shouldn&#39;ttry to make money out of journalism now.But we had a very solidand clear conviction,that we knew that the hyperconnectedenvironment of social mediacould maybe allow us to consolidatea network of experimental journaliststhroughout the country.So we launched a Facebook page first,and then a manifesto,and started to cover the streetsin a very simple way.

zh-cn:然后一个让人意想不到的事情发生了任何人都没有预想到的街道游行在圣保罗开始了他们开始的时候是非常具体和小范围的是为了反对公交车票的涨价这是那个公交车上面写着”小偷“但是这些示威游行开始扩展他们持续发生所以警方使用暴力来压制他们也开始加强但是那还有另一个问题一个我相信更重要的问题那就是报道真实性的问题这些主流媒体报道的真相可以被任何一个当时在街道上的人推翻如果他们说出事实，到底发生了什么在那里。就是因为这些不一致的报道让我才觉得让这些游行使这个国家有了长期的政治对话在那里，有成千上万有可能超过了一百多万人占领了全国的街道
en:But then something happened,something that wasn&#39;t predicted,that no one could have anticipated.Street protests startedto erupt in São Paulo.They began as very local and specific.They were against the bus fare hikethat had just happened in the city.This is a bus.It&#39;s written there, &quot;Theft.&quot;But those kind of manifestationsstarted to grow,and they kept happening.So the police violence against themstarted to grow as well.But there was another conflict,the one I believe that&#39;smore important hereto make my point thatit was a narrative conflict.There was this mainstream mediaversion of the factsthat anyone who was on the streetscould easily challengeif they presented their own visionof what was actually happening there.And it was this clash of visions,this clash of narratives,that I think turned those protestsinto a long period in the countryof political reckoningwhere hundreds of thousands of people,probably more than a million peopletook to the streets in the whole country.
时间： 6:48
zh-cn:但已经不再是关于公共交通价格的上升而是关于所有的事情人民的要求，他们的期望他们在街上的原因有各式各样，也互相矛盾在许多情况下。如果你能看懂，你就会明白但这是个在政治发泄的环境中这个国家所正在经历的它确实是关于政治但也关于新的管理模式用一个新的方式去交流在那样的环境中，媒体 NINJA 诞生了从一个无人知道的组织变成了全球奇迹因为我们用了正确的设备我们没有用高大的摄像机我们基本上用了它我们用了智能手机因为它，所以我们可以隐身于这些游行中它还让我们达到另一个目的还原游行最真实的一面使那些在家的人看到主观视角
en:But it wasn&#39;t aboutthe bus fare hike anymore.It was about everything.The people&#39;s demands, their expectations,the reasons why they were on the streetscould be as diverse as they couldbe contradictory in many cases.If you could read it,you would understand me.But it was in this environmentof political catharsisthat the country was going throughthat it had to do with politics, indeed,but it had to do alsowith a new way of organizing,through a new way of communicating.It was in that environmentthat Mídia NINJA emergedfrom almost anonymityto become a national phenomenon,because we did have the right equipment.We are not using big cameras.We are using basically this.We are using smartphones.And that, actually, allowed us to becomeinvisible in the middle of the protests,but it allowed us to do something else:to show what it was liketo be in the protests,to present to people at homea subjective perspective.
时间： 8:00
zh-cn:还有最重要要比设备更重要的就是我们的思想我们没有像其他的媒体我们不在为新闻竞争我们只想鼓励人们邀请人们，和教导他们怎么变成一个直播人员，怎们做到这个这就是为什们我们从一个几个人的组织在几个星期中我们成倍增加，甚至在全国范围内。所以在一两个星期内，当这些游行发生的时候我们这些上千的年轻人在全国各地，用着网络链接着我们同时报导着50多个城市这是任何一个电视频道都做不到的这就是为什们我们突然变成了主流的媒体我们当初在脸谱网拥有几千的收听者现在已经有差不多25万的收听者我们公布的信息和视频每星期平均被一千多万人看到比任何一个杂志或者新闻社都多
en:But there was somethingthat is more important,I think, than the equipment.It was our mindset,because we are not behavingas a media outlet.We are not competing for news.We are trying to encourage people,to invite people,and to actually teach peoplehow to do this, how they alsocould become broadcasters.And that was crucial to turn Mídia NINJAfrom a small group of people,and in a matter of weeks,we multiplied and we grewexponentially throughout the country.So in a matter of a week or two,as the protests kept happening,we were hundreds of young peopleconnected in this networkthroughout the country.We were covering more than50 cities at the same time.That&#39;s something thatno TV channel could ever do.That was responsiblefor turning us suddenly, actually,into kind of the mainstreammedia of social media.So we had a couple of thousandsof followers on our Facebook page,and soon we had a quarterof a million followers.Our posts and our videoswere being seen by more than11 million timelines a week.It was way more than any newspaperor any magazine could ever do.
时间： 9:16
zh-cn:NINJA 变了不只是一个媒体播报，或者项目它变成了一个公共服务为了人民，为了游行者为了积极分子因为他们都有一个简单，有效率，和平的工具去面对警察或者媒体的权威我们很多的相片都被很多电视节目用到很多电视台开始用我们的直播当事情白热化的时候我们的图像可以免一些的牢狱之灾让那些被不公平抓进去的人，被诬告的人，用我们的图片证明他们的清白不幸的是，这也让NINGA很快的变成警察的眼中钉，敌人我们被严重的打击，最终被逮捕发生了很多次但是这个经历也有帮助，因为我们还在网上这个帮助引发一个很重要的争论关于媒体的职责和新闻，出版社的自由
en:And that turned Mídia NINJAinto something else,more than a media outlet,than a media project.It became almost like a public serviceto the citizen, to the protester,to the activist,because they had a very simpleand efficient and peaceful toolto confront both policeand media authority.Many of our images started to be used in regular TV channels.Our livestreams started to be broadcasteven in regular televisionswhen things got really rough.Some our images were responsibleto take some people out of jail,people who were being arrested unfairlyunder false accusations,and we could prove them innocent.And that also turned Mídia NINJA very soonto be seen as almostan enemy of cops, unfortunately,and we started to be severely beaten,and eventually arrested on the streets.It happened in many cases.But that was also useful,because we were still at the web,so that helped to triggeran important debate in the countryon the role of the media itselfand the state of the freedomof the press in the country.
时间：10:33
zh-cn:现在 NINJA 已经逐步变成在我们的期望中一个全国网络，拥有许多的年轻人在当地自我组织去报道社会，和一些人权问题也让他们可以不仅政治地，也能报刊地表达自己
en:So Mídia NINJA now evolvedand finally consolidated itselfin what we hoped it would become:a national networkof hundreds of young people,self-organizing themselves locallyto cover social, human rights issues,and expressing themselvesnot only politicallybut journalistically.
时间：10:59
zh-cn:在今年的年初，我开始当 NINJA 已经变成了一个自我组织的网络我开始了另一个项目叫 Fluxo，在葡萄牙语中是 “直播”是一个新闻演播室，在圣保罗的市中心在那里，我用直播去做实验我叫这个“后电视格式”但是我也在想办法去为自由报道集资用和听众直接联系和一些活跃，主动的听众因为这次，我想尝试营生用我当初的催泪瓦斯计划
en:What I started to doin the beginning of this year,as Mídia NINJA is alreadya self-organizing network,I&#39;m dedicating myself to another project.It&#39;s called Fluxo,which is Portuguese for &quot;stream.&quot;It&#39;s a journalism studioin São Paulo downtown,where I used livestream to experimentwith what I call post-television formats.But I&#39;m also trying to come up with waysto finance independent journalismthrough a direct relationshipwith an audience,with an active audience,because now I really wantto try to make a livingout of my tear gas resolution back then.
时间：11:41
zh-cn:这次，它更有重要性这个我相信比我的个人例子更重要，更关键我先面说过，直播可以将网络变成个巨大的电视但我还相信另一个事情因为看到这么多人用了它之后不只是报道，但是用他们去政治性的组织自己我相信直播可以将网络空间变成一个全球政治场所在那里，每个人都拥有声音被正视的声音因为直播将不再让政治演讲垄断新闻播报让那些在政治方面的语言自由不再只是政治家或权威人士的专利通过这种直接，非传达的方式交流和交换经验让人们能够提问题，和影响权威在我们即将看到的方面
en:But there&#39;s somethingmore significant here,something that I believe is more importantand more crucial than my personal example.I said that livestream could turn the webinto a colossal TV network,but I believe it does something else,because after watching people using it,not only to cover things but to express,to organize themselves politically,I believe livestream can turn cyberspaceinto a global political arenawhere everyone might have a voice,a proper voice,because livestream takes the monopolyof the broadcast political discourse,of the verbal aspectof the political dialogueout of the mouths of just politiciansand political pundits alone,and it empowers the citizenthrough this direct and non-mediated powerof exchanging experiences and dialogue,empowers them to questionand to influence authoritiesin ways in which we are about to see.
时间：12:45
zh-cn:我相信它之所以这么重要，还因为这么简单的科技可以合并客观性和主观性用非常政治的方式，在我看来因为它真的可以帮助到观众人民去看这个世界用另一个人的眼睛所以它帮助人民，将他们自己放入别人的立场，环境中而我觉得，这就是我们的目的这应该是每一位优秀的报导者，行动者的目标但最重要，在任何好的政治中。
en:And I believe it does something elsethat might be even more important,that the simplicity of the technologycan merge objectivity and subjectivityin a very political way, as I see it,because it really helps the audience,the citizen, to see the worldthrough somebody else&#39;s eye,so it helps the citizento put him- or herselfin other people&#39;s place.And that idea, I think, should be the intention,should be the goal of any good journalism,any good activism,but most of all, any good politics.
