zh-cn:我的缪斯，美国女诗人艾蜜莉狄金森这么说她说：奇想不是来自知识，也不是来自无知而是一种悬念悬吊在在我们的自我认知和我们已经遗忘的传统中从屋子里的这些出色的演讲中我得到了许多灵感，看到许多可能性但是当我往外一看我们看到的建筑是多么死板多么抗拒这些新观点我们创造了这些神奇的事物但最终连改变一道墙都是这么困难。我们赞同这些一板一眼的盒子但我只对创造那些前所未有的空间感兴趣那些史无前例的那些只存在我们的心灵和想象中的空间我认为那才是建筑的本质
en:I&#39;ll start with my favorite muse, Emily Dickinson,who said that wonder is not knowledge, neither is it ignorance.It&#39;s something which is suspendedbetween what we believe we can be,and a tradition we may have forgotten.And I think, when I listen to these incredible people here,I&#39;ve been so inspired — so many incredible ideas, so many visions.And yet, when I look at the environment outside,you see how resistant architecture is to change.You see how resistant it is to those very ideas.We can think them out. We can create incredible things.And yet, at the end,it&#39;s so hard to change a wall.We applaud the well-mannered box.But to create a space that never existed is what interests me;to create something that has never been,a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits.And I think that&#39;s really what architecture is based on.

zh-cn:建筑不是建立在水泥钢铁，和泥土而是建立在奇想上。是奇想创建了伟大的城市和伟大的空间。我认为建筑便是如此。建筑是一个故事建筑是一个借着实体来诉说的故事它也是一个和不可能拔河及挣扎的故事。想想那些伟大的建筑，大教堂，庙宇金字塔，宝塔印度的那些城市之类这些不可思议的城市和建筑不是来自一个模糊的概念，而是人
en:Architecture is not based on concreteand steel and the elements of the soil.It&#39;s based on wonder.And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities,the greatest spaces that we have had.And I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story.By the way, it is a story that is told throughits hard materials.But it is a story of effort and struggleagainst improbabilities.If you think of the great buildings, of the cathedrals, of the temples,of the pyramids, of pagodas,of cities in India and beyond,you think of how incredible this is that that was realizednot by some abstract idea, but by people.

zh-cn:所有建立的都能被重建所有矗立的都能更完美这些是我认为对建筑来说真正重要的事。我期待能在这些概念范围下创作这是非常个人的这大概不是评论家会喜欢的概念建筑评论家，城市设计者大概也不苟同但我认为当我们生活在建筑里，城市里和公共空间有所联系时它们就像空气一样必要。
en:So, anything that has been made can be unmade.Anything that has been made can be made better.There it is: the things that I really believeare of important architecture.These are the dimensions that I like to work with.It&#39;s something very personal.It&#39;s not, perhaps, the dimensions appreciated by art criticsor architecture critics or city planners.But I think these are the necessary oxygenfor us to live in buildings, to live in cities,to connect ourselves in a social space.

zh-cn:我认为乐观是建筑的推进力建筑是唯一需要相信未来的专业你可以做一个悲观的将军、政治家、或是经济学者一个忧郁的音乐家、一个阴暗的画家但建筑师应该狂喜地期盼着美好未来我相信这就是社会进步的原因
en:And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward.It&#39;s the only profession where you have to believe in the future.You can be a general, a politician, an economist who is depressed,a musician in a minor key, a painter in dark colors.But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better.And it is that belief that I think drives society.

zh-cn:今日我们被悲观的说法包围但就算在这样的时代我仍然相信建筑可以为一个伟大的目的而奋斗想想那些伟大的城市想想帝国大厦、或是洛克菲勒中心它们都是建立在那些绝非最好的时机但建筑的精神和力量领导着这些社会和政治
en:And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us.And yet it is in times like thisthat I think architecture can thrive with big ideas,ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities.Think of the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Center.They were built in times that werenot really the best of times in a certain way.And yet that energy and power of architecturehas driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy.

zh-cn:我也相信建筑是一种表现我从来不喜欢中立我不喜欢在人生，或任何事情中中立表现就像蒸馏咖啡，它汲取咖啡的精髓这就是表现。很多建筑都缺少这种精神因为我们认为建筑是一个中立的领域一个没有看法的领域也没有价值观但我相信表现一个城市和个人空间的表现赋予建筑意义
en:So again, I am a believer in the expressive.I have never been a fan of the neutral.I don&#39;t like neutrality in life, in anything.I think expression.And it&#39;s like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee.That&#39;s what expression is.It&#39;s been missing in much of the architecture,because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered,the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion,that has no value.And yet, I believe it is the expression —expression of the city, expression of our own space —that gives meaning to architecture.
时间： 3:24
zh-cn:那些表现空间不是哑的表现空间不只是表达那些我们已经知道的事情表现空间可能会让我们不安但我认为那也是生命中的一部分人生不应该只是麻木的微笑而是越过历史的深渊到一些未竟之地如果我们不试，可能也无法到达的境地。
en:And, of course, expressive spaces are not mute.Expressive spaces are not spacesthat simply confirm what we already know.Expressive spaces may disturb us.And I think that&#39;s also part of life.Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile,but to reach out across the abyss of history,to places we have never been,and would have perhaps been, had we not been so lucky.

zh-cn:激进和保守激进是什么意思？这是有根据的在建筑的传统里我认为这就是建筑的意义，激进而不是一些死去的形态安全地包装在传统里它是一个活生生的与宇宙的关联性一个正在进行的故事不是一个好结局或是坏结局而是我们正参与着的故事我们的行为影响着故事
en:So again, radical versus conservative.Radical, what does it mean? It&#39;s something which is rooted,and something which is rooted deep in a tradition.And I think that is what architecture is, it&#39;s radical.It&#39;s not just a conservation in formaldehydeof dead forms.It is actually a living connectionto the cosmic event that we are part of,and a story that is certainly ongoing.It&#39;s not something that has a good ending or a bad ending.It&#39;s actually a story in which our acts themselvesare pushing the story in a particular way.

zh-cn:我是个激进建筑的信徒你们都见过苏联的建筑那就是传统那就像过去的拉斯韦加斯保存情绪，保存传统阻碍我们的思想进步激进便是面对这些保守建筑便是以我们的知觉去面对所以我认为它不该是冷酷的
en:So again I am a believer in the radical architecture.You know the Soviet architecture of that buildingis the conservation.It&#39;s like the old Las Vegas used to be.It&#39;s about conserving emotions, conserving the traditionsthat have obstructed the mind in moving forwardand of course what is radical is to confront them.And I think our architecture is a confrontationwith our own senses.Therefore I believe it should not be cool.
时间： 4:39
zh-cn:许多人喜欢那种冷酷的建筑我总是反对。我认为情绪是必须的没有情绪的人生便不是人生甚至我们的思想都是情绪化的没理由它不能出现在我们的伦理观或用以哲学地解释我们是谁我认为情绪是一个次元将它带进城市空间、城市生活非常重要
en:There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture.I&#39;ve always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed.Life without emotion would really not be life.Even the mind is emotional.There is no reason which does not take a positionin the ethical sphere, in the philosophical mystery of what we are.So I think emotion is a dimensionthat is important to introduce into city space, into city life.
时间： 5:04
zh-cn:我们都在情绪中挣扎我认为着也是世界神奇的地方冷酷无感和情绪之间的对峙便是一种城市所兼容的对话。城市的进步不只是城市的形态而是这些情绪的具体化不只是那些盖这些建筑的人更是那些居民的情绪。
en:And of course, we are all about the struggle of emotions.And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place.And of course, the confrontation of the cool, the unemotional with emotion,is a conversation that I thinkcities themselves have fostered.I think that is the progress of cities.It&#39;s not only the forms of cities,but the fact that they incarnate emotions,not just of those who build them,but of those who live there as well.

zh-cn:神秘，那些不言自明的。我们往往想了解所有事但建筑不是一种有文字的语言它是一个语言，但不是一种能被简化为一些问题百出的文字的语言外面有太多平庸的建筑它诉说故事，故事很短它说“我无话可说”（笑声）
en:Inexplicable versus understood. You know, too often we want to understand everything.But architecture is not the language of words.It&#39;s a language. But it is not a language that can be reducedto a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write.Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banaltell you a story, but the story is very short,which says, &quot;We have no story to tell you.&quot;(Laughter)
时间： 5:49
zh-cn:重要的是带进一种难以言喻的建筑次元这语言是以比例、面积材质、光线组成的它们以不同元素组成像一种复杂的矢量矩阵它不是平铺直述但深入我们的生活与一个城市的历史，居民的历史那些认为建筑应该直截了当的想法我认为是错误的那只能把建筑简化为平庸
en:So the important thing actually,is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions,which might be totally inexplicable in words,because they operate in proportions,in materials, in light.They connect themselves into various sources,into a kind of complex vector matrixthat isn&#39;t really frontalbut is really embedded in the lives,and in the history of a city, and of a people.So again, the notion that a building should just be explicitI think is a false notion,which has reduced architecture into banality.

zh-cn:手绘和电子计算当然，今日谁能不用电子计算机呢？我们依赖电子计算机来实践许多想法但计算机应该像是手套手才是真正赐予计算机力量的东西因为我相信手在它原始的、生理的难解下仍然有种力量。虽然我们不知从何而来虽然我们不需要故作神秘我们知道手是由一种超越我们能力的力量所赐予我用手描绘的时候它有可能在模拟计算机，但它仍不同与计算机所绘它是来自于一种未见，未知，无解的力量我想告诉在这个领域工作的你们如何让计算机根据手来描绘而不是手根据计算机来描绘
en:Hand versus the computer.Of course, what would we be without computers?Our whole practice depends on computing.But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand;the hand should really be the driver of the computing power.Because I believe that the handin all its primitive, in all its physiological obscurity,has a source, though the source is unknown,though we don&#39;t have to be mystical about it.We realize that the hand has been given usby forces that are beyond our own autonomy.And I think when I draw drawingswhich may imitate the computer, but are not computer drawings —drawings that can come from sourcesthat are completely not known, not normal, not seen,yet the hand — and that&#39;s what I really, to all of you who are working —how can we make the computer respond to our handrather than the hand responding to the computer.

zh-cn:我想这也是建筑复杂的一部分因为我们都太习惯于简单为上的束缚啊。但我不这么想听你们演讲，这些复杂的思考这些意义的多重层次是惊人的我们不该在建筑上逃避脑科手术、原子论遗传学、经济学都是一些非常复杂的领域建筑不该逃避去呈现一个虚假的简单世界世界是复杂的。空间是复杂的。空间将自己摺叠成一个新世界它如此神奇它不能被简化成那些我们往往过分赞扬的作品。我们的生活是复杂的我们的情绪是复杂的我们的智趣是复杂的我相信建筑应该反应那些环绕我们的复杂在我们所有的亲密空间
en:I think that&#39;s part of what the complexity of architecture is.Because certainly we have gotten used to the propagandathat the simple is the good. But I don&#39;t believe it.Listening to all of you, the complexity of thought,the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming.And I think we shouldn&#39;t shy away in architecture,You know, brain surgery, atomic theory,genetics, economicsare complex complex fields.There is no reason that architecture should shy awayand present this illusory world of the simple.It is complex. Space is complex.Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds.And as wondrous as it is,it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplificationthat we have often come to be admired.And yet, our lives are complex.Our emotions are complex.Our intellectual desires are complex.So I do believe that architecture as I see itneeds to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have,in every intimacy that we possess.

zh-cn:这代表着建筑是政治的政治不是建筑的敌人政治是城市，是我们所有人我往往相信建筑本身就算是私人住宅，当有人见到它，便成为一个政治行为因为他人也可以看见住在一个彼此越来越有关联的世界逃避这个层面而普遍的选择一种纯粹建筑那种看上去像个抽象物件，出于自发的建筑，我从来不感兴趣我相信与历史产生的相互作用和历史对话是困难的尝试掌握它，创造一个超越一般预设的立场，成为一种评判
en:Of course that means that architecture is political.The political is not an enemy of architecture.The politeama is the city. It&#39;s all of us together.And I&#39;ve always believed that the act of architecture,even a private house, when somebody else will see it, is a political act,because it will be visible to others.And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more.So again, the evasion of that sphere,which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture,the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract objecthas never appealed to me.And I do believe that this interactionwith the history, with history that is often very difficult,to grapple with it, to createa position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique.

zh-cn:因为建筑不只是给答案同时也在发问像人生一样。重要的是保持真实今日我们几乎可以模拟所有东西但有一件事是永远不能模拟的便是人心，便是人的灵魂建筑和它们息息相关因为我们生于建筑，死于建筑真正的建筑出自内心，而不是来自学识不是来自书本或理论是我们可触碰的真实，一扇门，一扇窗门槛，床这些平凡的物件我在每个作品中尝试把这个深奥又多元的虚拟世界带进真实世界中创造一个办公环境一个永续空间存在于虚拟世界中也能在真实世界中存在
en:Because architecture is also the asking of questions.It&#39;s not only the giving of answers.It&#39;s also, just like life, the asking of questions.Therefore it is important that it be real.You know we can simulate almost anything.But the one thing that can be ever simulatedis the human heart, the human soul.And architecture is so closely intertwined with itbecause we are born somewhere and we die somewhere.So the reality of architecture is visceral. It&#39;s not intellectual.It&#39;s not something that comes to us from books and theories.It&#39;s the real that we touch — the door, the window,the threshold, the bed —such prosaic objects. And yet,I try, in every building, to take that virtual world,which is so enigmatic and so rich,and create something in the real world.Create a space for an office,a space of sustainabilitythat really works between that virtualityand yet can be realized as something real.

zh-cn:意外和习惯习惯是什么？不过是一个束缚拿来饮鸩止渴的毒药意外永远是意外就像大教堂，它让人出乎意外它永远让人意外就像法蘭克蓋里的建筑，它们在未来也会继续出人意外而不是那些我们早已习惯的建筑形态以它们虚假的稳妥而是一个充满张力的建筑，一个超越自己的建筑它亲近人心和灵魂突破习惯的枷锁
en:Unexpected versus habitual.What is a habit? It&#39;s just a shackle for ourselves.It&#39;s a self-induced poison.So the unexpected is always unexpected.You know, it&#39;s true, the cathedrals, as unexpected,will always be unexpected.You know Frank Gehry&#39;s buildings, they will continue to be unexpected in the future.So not the habitual architecture that instills in usthe false sort of stability,but an architecture that is full of tension,an architecture that goes beyond itselfto reach a human soul and a human heart,and that breaks out of the shackles of habits.
时间：10:26
zh-cn:建筑加强了我们的习惯当我们日复一日见到同样的建筑我们习惯于从这个角度看世界这些光线，这些材质我们开始相信世界就像我们看到的这些建筑一样但这些建筑却受限于创造者的技术和想象力
en:And of course habits are enforced by architecture.When we see the same kind of architecturewe become immured in that world of those angles,of those lights, of those materials.We think the world really looks like our buildings.And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wondersthat have been part of them.
时间：10:45
zh-cn:意外也是原始我时常想到原始和精练原始是什么？原始就是一种纯净的经验，不被奢华和昂贵的材质影响不被那些高度文明所认同的那些精致影响。空间里应用的原始就像在未来可以把永续的概念变成原始空间一个不经装饰的空间一个不经矫饰的空间一个凉爽的空间反应着我们所期望的。一个不会像一条训练良好的狗一样跟随着我们的空间而是带领我们、示范着其它的可能性，其它的经验那些在建筑史上从未使用的字眼。
en:So again, the unexpected which is also the raw.And I often think of the raw and the refined.What is raw? The raw, I would sayis the naked experience, untouched by luxury,untouched by expensive materials,untouched by the kind of refinementthat we associate with high culture.So the rawness, I think, in space,the fact that sustainability can actually, in the futuretranslate into a raw space,a space that isn&#39;t decorated,a space that is not mannered in any source,but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature,might be refractive to our desires.A space that doesn&#39;t always follow uslike a dog that has been trained to follow us,but moves ahead into directions of demonstratingother possibilities, other experiences,that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture.

zh-cn:交叉重叠也是我的兴趣因为它创造一种新的能量我喜欢尖锐，而不是迟钝的那些专注于真实的那些力量饱满的。借着它来影响就算只是一个小地方。
en:And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to mebecause it creates a kind of a spark of new energy.And so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt,something which is focused on reality,something that has the power, through its leverage,to transform even a very small space.
时间：11:56
zh-cn:或许建筑不像科学的影响力这么大但借着这个焦点可以产生一种阿基米德式的杠杆效应改变我们对世界的看法往往我们只需要一个建筑来改变我们的经验法则：我们对历史和可能性的看法世界如何存在于稳定和震荡中建筑都有它们各自的形态这些形态是很难改变的但我仍然相信在所有社会在所有公共空间里都有一种想要沟通的欲望而不是模糊的想法，模糊的技术一些能够指出不同方向的前进、后退、左右或环绕着这是一个共同的记忆我相信我最大的兴趣便是记忆没有记忆我们就成了失忆者我们会忘记我们的前进的方向以及我们选择这个方向的原因
en:So architecture maybe is not so big, like science,but through its focal pointit can leverage in an Archimedian waywhat we think the world is really about.And often it takes just a buildingto change our experience of what could be done, what has been done,how the world has remained both in between stability and instability.And of course buildings have their shapes.Those shapes are difficult to change.And yet, I do believe that in every social space,in every public space,there is a desire to communicate morethan just that blunt thought, that blunt technique,but something that pinpoints, and can point in various directionsforward, backward, sideways and around.So that is indeed what is memory.So I believe that my main interest is to memory.Without memory we would be amnesiacs.We would not know which way we were going,and why we are going where we&#39;re going.
时间：12:52
zh-cn:所以我对那些过目即忘的复制从来不感兴趣把那些做过的事反反复复地重新排列当然，它们能得到评论家的赞扬评论家总是喜欢那些一再重复的演出但我宁可演奏一些前所未有的音符就算有瑕疵也不要重复那些被反复演奏的乐章它们因毫无意义而空洞记忆组成城市，记忆组成世界没有记忆，也就没有值得诉说的故事也无路可走
en:So I&#39;ve been never interested in the forgettable reuse,rehashing of the same things over and over again,which, of course, get accolades of critics.Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way.But I rather play somethingcompletely unheard of,and even with flaws,than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowedby its meaninglessness.So again, memory is the city, memory is the world.Without the memory there would be no story to tell.There would be nowhere to turn.
时间：13:23
zh-cn:那值得记忆的，是我们的世界，我们对世界的观感那不只是我们的记忆更是那些记忆我们的人建筑不是沉默的它是一门能够沟通的艺术它诉说一个故事。故事深入我们模糊的欲望深入那些平日接触不到的资源深入那些被埋葬的千年让它们回到一个正确而平等的地位。
en:The memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is.And it&#39;s not only our memory,but those who remember us,which means that architecture is not mute.It&#39;s an art of communication.It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available.It can reach into millenniathat have been buried,and return them in a just and unexpected equity.
时间：13:52
zh-cn:我想，我从来不被“最好的建筑是沉默的建筑”吸引一个沉默的坟场是好的，但沉默的城市是不好的城市应该活跃，充满音乐和声音这是一个建筑的任务我相信创造这样一个活跃的，多元的空间能够把寻常的活动变得出乎意料把一个购物商场、一个游泳池做得像娱乐场所、像博物馆这是我们的梦想
en:So again, I think the notion thatthe best architecture is silent has never appealed to me.Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city.Cities should be full of vibrations, full of sound, full of music.And that indeed is the architectural missionthat I believe is important,is to create spaces that are vibrant,that are pluralistic,that can transform the most prosaic activities,and raise them to a completely different expectation.Create a shopping center, a swimming placethat is more like a museum than like entertainment.And these are our dreams.
时间：14:24
zh-cn:我认为建筑应该冒险这要花很多金钱和精力，当然但不应该保守我们不应该保守因为保守不能带我们前进去我们想去的方向当然冒险是世界的基础没有冒险的世界是不值得活的是的，我相信在每一个建筑里冒的险都是值得的。冒险去做那些从未悬吊的这样远的空间冒险去做一个前所未有的迷人灿烂的像所有城市的先驱。那些真正让建筑进步的冒险就算有它的缺陷，还是好过一直重复的空虚的现成品。
en:And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky.You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes,it should not play it safe.It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safeit&#39;s not moving us in a direction that we want to be.And I think, of course,risk is what underlies the world.World without risk would not be worth living.So yes, I do believe that the risk we take in every building.Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent.Risks of spaces that have never beenso dizzying,as they should be, for a pioneering city.Risks that really move architectureeven with all its flaws, into a space which is much betterthat the ever again repeatedhollowness of a ready-made thing.
时间：15:13
zh-cn:这就是我所相信的，建筑的意义。空间，而不是时尚也不是装潢只是希望创造一些不能被重复的不能在其它地方被模拟的。我们在那里可以呼吸可以梦想这些空间不只是一些人的奢侈享受而是对世上每个人都有重要性
en:And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be.It&#39;s about space. It&#39;s not about fashion.It&#39;s not about decoration.It&#39;s about creating with minimal meanssomething which can not be repeated,cannot be simulated in any other sphere.And there of course is the space that we need to breathe,is the space we need to dream.These are the spaces that arenot just luxurious spaces for some of us,but are important for everybody in this world.
时间：15:40
zh-cn:这无关时尚、或是改变理论而是为树木创造一个空间在空间中创造一个能够迎接大自然的地方城市中的家居空间一个从未见光的空间可以进入城市的密度这就是建筑的本质
en:So again, it&#39;s not about the changing fashions, changing theories.It&#39;s about carving out a space for trees.It&#39;s carving out a space where nature can enterthe domestic world of a city.A space where something which has never seen a light of daycan enter into the inner workings of a density.And I think that is really the nature of architecture.

en:Now I am a believer in democracy.I don&#39;t like beautiful buildingsbuilt for totalitarian regimes.Where people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.And yet when I think of the poverty of societywhich doesn&#39;t give freedom to its people,I don&#39;t admire those buildings.So democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it.

en:And of course, at Ground Zero what else?It&#39;s such a complex project.It&#39;s emotional. There is so many interests.It&#39;s political. There is so many parties to this project.There is so many interests. There&#39;s money. There&#39;s political power.There are emotions of the victims.And yet, in all its messiness, in all its difficulties,I would not have liked somebody to say,&quot;This is the tabula rasa, mister architect — do whatever you want.&quot;I think nothing good will come out of that.

en:I think architecture is about consensus.And it is about the dirty word &quot;compromise.&quot; Compromise is not bad.Compromise, if it&#39;s artistic,if it is able to cope with its strategies —and there is my first sketch and the last rendering —it&#39;s not that far away.And yet, compromise, consensus,that is what I believe in.And Ground Zero, despite all its difficulties, it&#39;s moving forward.It&#39;s difficult. 2011, 2013.
