zh-cn:四年前的今天，恰巧是同一天我开办了一个时尚博客，名叫菜鸟风尚（Style Rookie）2011年9月，我创立了一本在线杂志面向青少年女生，名叫Rookiemag.com我叫泰薇·盖文森（Tavi Gevinson）我今天演讲的题目是“探索进行时”我用微软画图板画的这些图完全是为了配合今天主题的大胆创举和我使用PowerPoint的水平没半点关系（笑声）
en:Four years ago today, exactly, actually,I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.Last September of 2011, I started an online magazinefor teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.My name&#39;s Tavi Gevinson, andthe title of my talk is &quot;Still Figuring It Out,&quot;and the MS Paint quality of my slideswas a total creative decision in keeping with today&#39;s theme,and has nothing to do with my inabilityto use PowerPoint. (Laughter)

zh-cn:这个网站是为青少年女生做的。我是个女权主义者我是个流行文化迷对如何成为女强人深有研究众所周知，那些电影和电视节目是有影响力的。对我的网站也是所以我认为女强人的定义通常被人们曲解了取而代之的是平面的女超人要么鼓吹她某一种特质比如猫女之类要么夸大她的性欲还被视为能力但这些都不是女强人形象这简直无聊至极充其量是些纸片人那么问题就来了人们希望女人简单易懂女人因为没那么简单而大伤脑筋而实际上，女人是复杂的女人是多面的 － 并非因为女人很疯狂而是人类很疯狂而女人正巧是人类（笑声）
en:So I edit this site for teenage girls. I&#39;m a feminist.I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot aboutwhat makes a strong female character,and, you know, movies and TV shows,these things have influence. My own website.So I think the question of what makes a strong femalecharacter often goes misinterpreted,and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomenwho maybe have one quality that&#39;s played up a lot,like a Catwoman type,or she plays her sexuality up a lot,and it&#39;s seen as power.But they&#39;re not strong characters who happen to be female.They&#39;re completely flat,and they&#39;re basically cardboard characters.The problem with this is that thenpeople expect women to be that easy to understand,and women are mad at themselvesfor not being that simple,when, in actuality, women are complicated,women are multifaceted — not because women are crazy,but because people are crazy,and women happen to be people. (Laughter)

zh-cn:所以缺陷也是关键以前也有人这样说过女强人有弱点，也有缺陷或许你一开始不喜欢她但最终会欣赏她
en:So the flaws are the key.I&#39;m not the first person to say this.What makes a strong female characteris a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws,who is maybe not immediately likable,but eventually relatable.

zh-cn:我喜欢在认识一些问题的同时也去了解那些努力解决问题的人所以我喜欢看“广告狂人”（Mad Men）这类电视剧和“伴娘”（Bridesmaids）这类电影，这些女性角色或主人公是复杂的，多面的屏幕上写的莉娜·杜汉姆（Lena Dunham），她在HBO的新作“都市女孩”（Girls）将于下个月首映她说之所以拍这部作品是因为她觉得她认识的所有女人都是非常矛盾的而所有人也都这么觉得但女人的这一特点并没有被充分表现出来祝贺你们了（笑声）
en:I don&#39;t like to acknowledge a problemwithout also acknowledging those who work to fix it,so just wanted to acknowledge shows like &quot;Mad Men,&quot;movies like &quot;Bridesmaids,&quot; whose female charactersor protagonists are complex, multifaceted.Lena Dunham, who&#39;s on here, her show on HBOthat premiers next month, &quot;Girls,&quot;she said she wanted to start it because she felt thatevery woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions,and that feels accurate for all people,but you don&#39;t see women represented like that as much.Congrats, guys. (Laughs)

zh-cn:但我不觉得 － 我认为仍有一些女人的类型是未曾被展现的今天我们要关注的一类就是青少年因为我认为青少年是尤其矛盾的仍在不断探索当中90年代的“怪胎与书呆”（Freaks and Geeks）和“我所谓的生活”（My So-Called Life）中的角色琳赛·威尔（Lindsay Weir）安吉拉·切丝（Angela Chase）整部剧的前提基本上就是她们自我探索的过程可惜那两部剧只播了一季自那以后我再也没看到过类似的电视剧
en:But I don&#39;t feel that — I still feel that there are some typesof women who are not represented that way,and one group that we&#39;ll focus on today are teens,because I think teenagers are especially contradictoryand still figuring it out,and in the &#39;90s there was &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;and &quot;My So-Called Life,&quot; and their characters,Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase,I mean, the whole premise of the showswere just them trying to figure themselves out, basically,but those shows only lasted a season each,and I haven&#39;t really seen anything like that on TV since.

zh-cn:这是一张描述我大脑的科学简图（笑声）－-是在我看那些电视剧时的写照我那时刚从初中升入高中 －-我现在高二了 －-我一直在设法调和那些女孩长大过程中行为规范的各种意见分歧你不能既聪明又漂亮做女权主义者就不能追逐时髦要不是为了别人的眼光，通常指男人你就不能在乎穿着打扮
en:So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — (Laughter) —around the time when I was,when I started watching those TV shows.I was ending middle school, starting high school —I&#39;m a sophomore now —and I was trying to reconcileall of these differences that you&#39;re told you can&#39;t bewhen you&#39;re growing up as a girl.You can&#39;t be smart and pretty.You can&#39;t be a feminist who&#39;s also interested in fashion.You can&#39;t care about clothes if it&#39;s not for the sakeof what other people, usually men, will think of you.

zh-cn:所以我一直都想弄清楚这是怎么一回事我感到有些困惑也有写在博客上我说我想为青少年女生办一个网站不是那种只展现单一的强势特点的因为我认为对女权主义的误解会让女孩们望而却步她们会认为作为女权主义者，必须做到对自己的信仰始终如一绝不能缺乏自信，绝不能心存疑虑要无所不知。但其实并非如此实际上，一旦我明白了女权主义不是一本规则手册，而是一种探讨一场对话和一个过程我对各种矛盾的调和就变得容易多了这是我去年办的一本杂志里的两页我是说，打那时起我就已经进军插图界了不过，好吧
en:So I was trying to figure all that out,and I felt a little confused,and I said so on my blog,and I said that I wanted to starta website for teenage girlsthat was not this kind of one-dimensionalstrong character empowerment thingbecause I think one thing that can be very alienatingabout a misconception of feminism is thatgirls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up tobeing perfectly consistent in your beliefs,never being insecure, never having doubts,having all of the answers. And this is not true,and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feelingbecame easier once I understood that feminismwas not a rulebook but a discussion,a conversation, a process,and this is a spread from a zine that I made last yearwhen I — I mean, I think I&#39;ve let myself go a biton the illustration front since.But, yeah.

zh-cn:所以我就在博客上说我想为青少年女生办一本读物，并邀请大家投稿文章，照片，什么都行来加入我们的团队我收到了大约3千封邮件我和我的编辑主任读了这些信并组建了一个团队于去年九月创刊这是一段我首位编辑来信的摘录上面说我们“菜鸟”杂志不是无所不知我们也在探索当中，但重点不在于为女孩们提供答案，更不是为了向她们颁发自己寻找答案的许可而是希望能让她们了解探索的主动权在她们自己手里她们可以提出自己的问题，找出自己的答案我相信以上种种，以及“菜鸟”杂志为我们解决各种困惑提供了很好的平台
en:So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publicationfor teenage girls and ask people to submittheir writing, their photography, whatever,to be a member of our staff.I got about 3,000 emails.My editorial director and I went through them andput together a staff of people,and we launched last September.And this is an excerpt from my first editor&#39;s letter,where I say that Rookie, we don&#39;t have all the answers,we&#39;re still figuring it out too, but the point is not togive girls the answers, and not even give them permissionto find the answers themselves,but hopefully inspire them to understand thatthey can give themselves that permission,they can ask their own questions, find their own answers,all of that, and Rookie, I think we&#39;ve been trying to make ita nice place for all of that to be figured out.

zh-cn:所以我不是在说，“学我们的样子”和“我们是完美的典范”，因为我们不是我们只是想帮助展现女孩们多姿多彩的另一面比如我们有文章名为《关注自我：如何忽视别人的眼光》但我们也有文章例如《啊噢 －－ 我正在探索》哈哈（笑声）这招真是屡试不爽啊我们也有文章名为《哭脸瞬间消融术》
en:So I&#39;m not saying, &quot;Be like us,&quot;and &quot;We&#39;re perfect role models,&quot; because we&#39;re not,but we just want to help represent girlsin a way that shows those different dimensions.I mean, we have articles called&quot;On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,&quot;but we also have articles like,oops — I&#39;m figuring it out!Ha ha. (Laughter)If you use that, you can get away with anything.We also have articles called&quot;How to Look Like You Weren&#39;t Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes.&quot;

zh-cn:那么以上所有，我仍然十分感谢那些电影里的角色和我们网站上的文章他们不仅仅是关于强大还包括自我认同自尊和自身缺点，以及如何对待
en:So all of that being said, I still really appreciatethose characters in movies andarticles like that on our site,that aren&#39;t just about being totally powerful,maybe finding your acceptance with yourselfand self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.

zh-cn:那么我希望我的演讲带给大家的是这一切的启示是，请学习史蒂薇·妮克丝（Stevie Nicks）学她就对了（笑声）因为我最欣赏她的是不同于所有的，就是她非常 －－ 从来都是霸气地出现在舞台上从不为她的缺点辩护能调和她所有矛盾的感受并能让你倾听，让你思考所以，请学习史蒂薇·妮克丝谢谢大家（掌声）
en:So what I you to take away from my talk,the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.Like, that&#39;s all you have to do. (Laughter)Because my favorite thing about her,other than, like, everything, is thatshe is very — has always beenunapologetically present on stage,and unapologetic about her flawsand about reconciling all of her contradictory feelingsand she makes you listen to them and think about them,and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.Thank you. (Applause)
