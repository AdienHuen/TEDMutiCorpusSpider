zh-cn:正如你们所知，我的工作是写儿童读物实际上，我也许是美国最广泛的儿童读物作者我经常告诉其他人我不想被看成一个科学家你能把我当做一个农民，或者穿着皮衣的人但是没人曾选是农民我今天来告诉你们是关于循环和顿悟顿悟通常指你发现你陷入某些境况你需要四处的碰壁去寻找顿悟
en:You know, what I do is write for children,and I&#39;m probably America&#39;smost widely read children&#39;s author, in fact.And I always tell peoplethat I don&#39;t want to show up looking like a scientist.You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,and no one has ever chose farmer.I&#39;m here today to talk to youabout circles and epiphanies.And you know, an epiphanyis usually something you find that you dropped someplace.You&#39;ve just got to go around the blockto see it as an epiphany.

zh-cn:这是一幅循环的图片我的一个朋友画的—理查德·鲍林布罗克这是中很复杂的我将要告诉你们的我的循环起源于60世纪源于俄亥俄州，斯朵高中当我还是个捣蛋鬼我是那种每周在男生宿舍被打到出血的那种人直到一个老师把我从这种生活中解救出来她把我解救出这种生活让我住在老师休息室的浴室里她悄悄的做着她一做就做了3年但是我不得不离开这个城镇带着特长，还有85美元，最终我落脚在斯圣弗朗西科（旧金山），加利福尼亚—遇到了我的爱人—回想到80年代，我发现开始在艾滋病组织工作是很必要的
en:That&#39;s a painting of a circle.A friend of mine did that — Richard Bollingbroke.It&#39;s the kind of complicated circlethat I&#39;m going to tell you about.My circle began back in the &#39;60sin high school in Stow, Ohiowhere I was the class queer.I was the guy beaten up bloodyevery week in the boys&#39; room,until one teacher saved my life.She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroomin the teachers&#39; lounge.She did it in secret.She did it for three years.And I had to get out of town.I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,and I ended up in San Francisco, California —met a lover —and back in the &#39;80s, found it necessaryto begin work on AIDS organizations.

zh-cn:大约三四年之前我在深夜接到了一通来自于那个老师，普斯顿老师的电话她说，“我需要见你我很失望我们从来没有以成年人的姿态互相了解你能来俄亥俄吗请把那个你寻找到的人也带过来我应该提一下我有胰脏癌但我想请你能忽略这部分
en:About three or four years ago,I got a phone call in the middle of the nightfrom that teacher, Mrs. Posten,who said, &quot;I need to see you.I&#39;m disappointedthat we never got to know each other as adults.Could you please come to Ohio,and please bring that manthat I know you have found by now.And I should mentionthat I have pancreatic cancer,and I&#39;d like you to pleasebe quick about this.&quot;

zh-cn:那，第二天我们就到了克利夫兰市我们遇见了她，交谈着，哭泣着我们知道她需要住进晚期病人的安养院我们为她找了一个，带她过去照顾她并照料她的家庭因为这是必须的有些事我们需要知道如何去做就是这个把我当做成年人看待想了解我的女生最终化成了盒中的粉末安置在我的手中所发生的就是循环的结束这就形成了一个循环—其中我所说的顿悟就得到了自我体现
en:Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.We found her one, we got her there,and we took care of herand watched over her family,because it was necessary.It&#39;s something we knew how to do.And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adultgot to know me,she turned into a box of ashesand was placed in my hands.And what had happenedwas the circle had closed,it had become a circle —and that epiphany I talked aboutpresented itself.

zh-cn:这顿悟是死亡是生命的一部分她救了我的命我和我朋友救了她的命那段日子需要的东西生命来完成（TBR）它需要真实和美好我很高兴这些今天被多次的提到它还需要—它需要尊严爱和欢乐我们的工作就是把这些散步开去
en:The epiphany isthat death is a part of life.She saved my life;I and my partner saved hers.And you know, that part of life needs everythingthat the rest of life does.It needs truth and beauty,and I&#39;m so happy it&#39;s been mentioned so much here today.It also needs —it needs dignity,love and pleasure,and it&#39;s our job to hand those things out.
