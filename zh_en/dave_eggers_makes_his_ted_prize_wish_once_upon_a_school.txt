zh-cn:这里我要感谢 TED 大会主办方，特别感谢克里斯和安弥我真不曾想象到我会有机会登上这个舞台我有好几周都没睡好觉了。刚才我在台下还跟尼尔比谁睡得更少呢为了准备这个演讲 我可谓从没有这么紧张过我刚刚意识到我一紧张就会这样子搓手好了，我今天主要是谈谈我们这个组织做的一些事情它的名字是“826瓦伦西亚”希望大家听完我的演讲后能有所启发，一起干类似的事情
en:Thank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.I cannot believe I&#39;m here.I have not slept in weeks.Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we&#39;ve sleptin anticipation for this. I&#39;ve never been so nervous —and I do this when I&#39;m nervous, I just realized. (Laughter)So, I&#39;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organizationcalled 826 Valencia, and then I&#39;m going to talkabout how we all might join in and do similar things.

zh-cn:2000年的时候，我住在布鲁克林那时我正在写我的第一本书每天白天，我都会在街上神智恍惚的来回走因为我每晚都是从夜里12点写到凌晨5点于是，到了白天，我就精神恍惚的在街上走白天，我不能完全集中精神，可是，我的工作时间比较灵活我住在布鲁克林区的斜坡公园附近那里是作家的汇集之地要是说到作家分布的情况那里的作家人数在整个社区中的比例是颇高的此外，我自小就是在一种教师的氛围中成长的我母亲是一位教师，我姐姐毕业后也当上了一名教师我有很多朋友在念完大学以后也走上了教师的岗位我经常听他们谈论学校里的事情他们说学校里有很多给人鼓舞的事情在发生我认为教师是最勤劳同时又经常能给人们带来启迪的人之一
en:Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn,I was trying to finish my first book,I was wandering around dazed every daybecause I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.So I would walk around in a daze during the day.I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours.In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope,there are a lot of writers —it&#39;s like a very high per capita ratioof writers to normal people.Meanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.My mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacherand after college so many of my friends went into teaching.And so I was always hearing them talk about their livesand how inspiring they were,and they were really sort of the most hard-workingand constantly inspiring people I knew.
时间： 1:30
zh-cn:此外，我也深知他们面临哪些困难知道他们的种种艰难处境他们遇到的其中一个难题是让孩子在读写这两方面的成绩得到提升这个问题在那些市立学校里头表现最突出那些学校的学生在家里根本不说英语此外 他们还有其他各种不同的需要包括学习障碍 而他们所在的学校则经常遇到资金不足的难题我的朋友跟我提起这事他们说：“我们要的是更多的人手对孩子给予更多一对一的关心要是我们能找到更多人，更多有经验的人让他们一对一的给孩子进行辅导，那就好了
en:But I knew so many of the things they were up against,so many of the struggles they were dealing with.And one of them was that so many of my friendsthat were teaching in city schools were having troublewith their students keeping up at grade level,in their reading and writing in particular.Now, so many of these students had come from householdswhere English isn&#39;t spoken in the home,where a lot of them have different special needs,learning disabilities. And of course they&#39;re working in schoolswhich sometimes and very often are under-funded.And so they would talk to me about this and say,&quot;You know, what we really need is just more people,more bodies, more one-on-one attention,more hours, more expertise from peoplethat have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one.&quot;
时间： 2:18
zh-cn:我就问：那你们干嘛不给孩子来个一对一的辅导？他们回答说 我们每个人都要负责五个班，每个班三四十人加起来我们每人每天都要应付180到200个学生我们怎么有可能给予学生哪怕是每人一小时的关注？除非你大幅度加大教师的工作量，并克隆出更多的老师于是我们开始考虑这事情与此同时我想到了我认识的那一班专业人士他们是作家、或编辑、或记者、或研究生或者教授助理，反正就是搞文字的这些人的工作时间都很灵活他们也对英语这门语言怀有浓厚兴趣此刻，我也想讲得更有条理但我显然是言不由衷了我尽可能讲得好一点吧。看 墙上那个钟告诉我要控制好时间！我认识的每个人都认同文字创作不可替代的意义民主的孕育、优质生活的形成，皆舍此不可而我的这些朋友他们有的是时间和兴趣但是，我们那时候还没有一种管道，把这两种需求结合起来
en:Now, I would say, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you just work with them one-on-one?&quot;And they would say, &quot;Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.This can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.How can we possibly give each studenteven one hour a week of one-on-one attention?&quot;You&#39;d have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.And so we started talking about this.And at the same time,I thought about this massive group of people I knew:writers, editors, journalists, graduate students,assistant professors, you name it.All these people that had sort of flexible daily hoursand an interest in the English word —I hope to have an interest in the English language,but I&#39;m not speaking it well right now. (Laughter)I&#39;m trying. That clock has got me.But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written wordin terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.And so they had, you know, their timeand their interest, but at the same timethere wasn&#39;t a conduit that I knew of in my communityto bring these two communities together.

zh-cn:其后我们搬回到旧金山，租了这所房子我们想把《麦思维尼季刊》那是一份每年出版两三次的（文学）刊物以及其他杂志，都放到那里我们第一次要搬进办公室啦在那以前，我的厨房就是办公室我们现在要搬到正式的办公室去并且我们打算与辅导中心共用一块场地我们那时候想：这里每天都会有那么多的作家、编辑、记者进出这个办公室为什么我们不把房子的大门打开让附近的孩子在放学后来得这里获得专家的课业辅导以此来拉近两个作家与孩子两个群体间的距离？我们就想我们只管在办公室干自己的事下午两点半孩子一放学，你就放下手头的工作或者你找别的时间去干，或者你干晚一点反正在下午你就把时间献给这些住在附近的孩子
en:So when I moved back to San Francisco, we rented this building.And the idea was to put McSweeney&#39;s —McSweeney&#39;s Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year,and a few other magazines —we were going to move it into an office for the first time.It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.We were going to move it into an office,and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center.So we thought, &quot;We&#39;ll have all these writers and editors and everybody —sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway,why don&#39;t we just open upthe front of the building for students to come in there after school,get extra help on their written homework,so you have basically no border between these two communities?&quot;So the idea was that we would beworking on whatever we&#39;re working on,at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you&#39;re doing,or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.You give those hours in the afternoonto the students in the neighborhood.
时间： 4:24
zh-cn:于是我们找到这房子，租了下来房东对此也十分支持。看，那是一副壁画它以壁画的方式来讲述印刷术的故事你要花点时间，走到大街上，远远的看，才能看得出其中的含义好了，我们就租下了这房子一切都很顺利，可是房东跟我们说这个区域是专门用作销售的你要搞点什么来卖啊！单单搞一个辅导中心是不够的！我们心想：真的要那么做吗？那时候我们真的想不到有什么东西值得卖的，但我们做了充分的研究发现那里原来是一个健身室，地板都是铺橡胶的，还有隔音的天花板和荧光灯。当我们把这些东西都拆下来以后，我们发现地面是木板做的。还能看到粉刷成白色的边，就在我们给那房子进行翻新的时候，有人喊出一句：“大家看，这是不是很像一艘船的内核？”于是我们仔细的环顾四周，又有人说，“嘿，不如我们就在此地卖海盗用品吧！”
en:So, we had this place, we rented it,the landlord was all for it. We did this mural,that&#39;s a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire historyof the printed word, in mural form — it takes a long timeto digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.So we rented this space.And everything was great except the landlord said,&quot;Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.You&#39;ve gotta sell something.You can&#39;t just have a tutoring center.&quot;So we thought, &quot;Ha ha! Really!&quot;And we couldn&#39;t think of anything necessarily to sell,but we did all the necessary research.It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below,acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors,whitewashed beams and it had the look —while we were renovating this place, somebody said,&quot;You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship.&quot;And we looked around and somebody else said,&quot;Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer.&quot; (Laughter)
时间： 5:20
zh-cn:说干就干。正因为这样做能够给人们带来一点笑料我们不认为那是纯粹的疯子的行为就这么决定了要卖海盗用品看，这时我在一块手绢上画的一幅画屋子里的东西都是一个木匠搞成的我们尽可能做成海盗屋的模样这是按尺寸出售的厚木板抗坏血病的装备还有手工制作的海盗假腿在顶上你还能看到海盗必备的眼罩那个黑色框里装的是日间使用的眼罩而素色和其他颜色的眼罩通常是在夜间一些特殊场合（比如酒吧）使用
en:And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh,and we said, &quot;There&#39;s a point to that.Let&#39;s sell pirate supplies.&quot; This is the pirate supply store.You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see,we made it look sort of pirate supply-like.Here you see planks sold by the footand we have supplies to combat scurvy.We have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display,which is the black column there for everyday usefor your eyepatch, and then you have the pasteland other colors for stepping out at night —special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever.
时间： 6:10
zh-cn:于是我们装修完以后就开张了。看，这是一个大盆子我们把一些小礼物放到里面去，孩子来了，就去那里找礼物。这是一个假眼——假如你眼睛坏了，可以用这个。还有这些贴在墙壁上的口号：“与海盗开玩笑。”就在你细读这些口号的时候，我们就在背后拉一下绳子就马上会有八个拖把头降临到你的头上那纯粹是我个人的“发明”，因为我说，总得要有东西摔到人们的头上啊，这东西就是拖把头。这个是“鱼缸戏院”，其实就是有一个金鱼缸，前面摆三张凳子，就在那后面就是我们的辅导中心镜头上看到的就是我们的辅导中心，背后则是“麦思维尼”的办公室我们就在那里做书刊的编辑工作
en:So we opened this place. And this is a vatthat we fill with treasures that students dig in.This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.These are some signs that we have all over the place:&quot;Practical Joking with Pirates.&quot;While you&#39;re reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counterand eight mop heads drop on your head.That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that drops on people&#39;s heads.It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater,which is just a saltwater tank with three seats,and then right behind it we set up this space,which was the tutoring center.So right there is the tutoring center,and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney&#39;s offices,where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that.
时间： 7:02
zh-cn:孩子们会来到这里——或者该这么说：当初我们确实是认为孩子会来到我们那里的现在空间都开放了我们可是花了几个月时间来翻新这地方啊那里有书、桌椅和其他的工具我在怕罗奥托市的一家假日酒店通过网上拍卖买来了11台G4苹果电脑，以及其他的东西。不管怎么说，反正我们是把一切都准备好了 我们就开始等（孩子到来）一开始我联系到了十二位朋友，他们都住在附近，并且跟我已认识很久。我们坐在办公室等，到了下午两点半 我们把一块牌放在门口的过道上，上面写着：“免费提供英语及写作辅导——一切免费，欢迎光临。”开始时我们想：孩子们一定会飞奔到这里来的他们一定会喜欢这地方。可是，我们看不到有孩子过来我们坐在桌边等啊等，就是看不到孩子的影子我们都感到非常沮丧我们一连等了好多个星期，就是等不到一个孩子
en:The kids would come in —or we thought they would come in. I should back up.We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and monthsrenovating this place.We had tables, chairs, computers, everything.I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Altoand I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.Anyway, we bought &#39;em, we set everything up and then we waited.It was started with about 12 of my friends,people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.And we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalkand it just said, &quot;Free Tutoring for Your English-Relatedand Writing-Related Needs — Just Come In, It&#39;s All Free.&quot;And we thought, &quot;Oh, they&#39;re going to storm the gates,they&#39;re gonna love it.&quot; And they didn&#39;t.And so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.And everybody was becoming very discouragedbecause it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in.
时间： 8:02
zh-cn:这时候，有人提醒我们说也许是因为信任的问题毕竟我们是一个卖海盗用品的店铺啊这一点我们倒是没有想到于是，我找到了妮涅娃·卡里咖丽她在旧金山当过老师后来到了新墨西哥洲去教书了她经验十足懂得教育的门道跟我们那个社区的老师和社会名流也很熟我劝她搬回旧金山让她担任整个项目的执行主任很快的，她就跟当地的老师家长、学生以及相关人士做好了思想工作后来我们的辅导中心就变得天天都人满为患了
en:And then somebody alerted us to the factthat maybe there was a trust gap,because we were operating behind a pirate supply store. (Laughter)We never put it together, you know?And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari,a longtime San Francisco educator —she was teaching in Mexico City,she had all the experience necessary,knew everything about education,was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood —I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.She took over as executive director.Immediately, she made the inroads with the teachersand the parents and the students and everything,and so suddenly it was actually full every day.
时间： 8:50
zh-cn:我们每天都努力为学生提供一对一的辅导我们务求做到给予每一位学生“一对一”的关注因为，研究表明一年当中假如能够给予学生35－40个小时的“一对一”辅导学生的学习成绩会跃升一个层次来到这里的孩子，他们在家里大多不说英语他们的家长有时也会随着他们一同到来也许你在画面上看不到，但是我们准备了一张长椅子那是我在伯克莱的一次拍卖会上买下来的家长们有时会来看自己的孩子我们说最根本一点就是一对一的关注我们每天都被孩子们围着，简直忙不过来假如你是住在瓦伦西亚街附近的话，每到下午2：30要是你到街上走你会迎头撞上背着书包向着辅导中心跑的孩子
en:And what we were trying to offer every daywas one-on-one attention.The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.You know, it&#39;s been proventhat 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention,a student can get one grade level higher.And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.They come there, many times their parents —you can&#39;t see it, but there&#39;s a church pewthat I bought in a Berkeley auction right there —the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.So that was the basis of it,was one-on-one attention.And we found ourselves full every day with kids.If you&#39;re on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m.,2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often,by the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space,
时间： 9:32
zh-cn:这看起来有点不正常，因为那里已经变成“半个学校”了因为去那里已经变成一种情感上的需要这就是我们的辅导中心的独特之处另外，去辅导中心不会带有任何的羞辱成分因为孩子们不是去上“差等生补习班”或者是诸如此类的机构。那里只有一个名字：“826瓦伦西亚”首先，那里是一家卖海盗用品的店，这一点就够呛了此外，我们在房间的后面还有一个出版机构所以说，我们的实习生经常也是坐在同样一张桌子边他们的旁边就是参加辅导的孩子
en:which is very strange, because it&#39;s school, in a way.But there was something psychological happening therethat was just a little bit different.And the other thing was, there was no stigma.Kids weren&#39;t going into the &quot;Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help,&quot;or something like that. It was 826 Valencia.First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.And then secondly, there&#39;s a publishing company in the back.And so our interns were actually workingat the same tables very often,and shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.
时间：10:04
zh-cn:所以说，那里不仅仅是辅导中心出版中心还是一个写作中心他们来到这里以后也许是和高中生一起完成一部小说——我们有天赋过人的孩子根本不会有羞辱的存在大家坐在一起，那是一种充满创意的环境孩子们看着身边的大人，也要学习学习而这些大人，虽然他们也在忙着自己的事情孩子们可以把头探过来，问大人问题这样一来，相互都可以在交流中提炼出价值大人和孩子之间是可以相互感染的。但是 我们也遇到了一个令我们头痛的问题特别是对于麦思维尼出版机构的员工来说，更是如此因为他们当初来到这里时并没有想到会遇到今日之种种。我们那地方只有一个洗手间而我们每天都会迎来六十多名学生，这真是一个难题
en:And so it became a tutoring center —publishing center, is what we called it —and a writing center.They go in, and they might be working with a high school studentactually working on a novel — because we had very gifted kids, too.So there&#39;s no stigma.They&#39;re all working next to each other. It&#39;s all a creative endeavor.They&#39;re seeing adults. They&#39;re modeling their behavior.These adults, they&#39;re working in their field.They can lean over, ask a question of one of these adultsand it all sort of feeds on each other.There&#39;s a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem,especially for the adults working at McSweeney&#39;swho hadn&#39;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up,was that there was just the one bathroom. (Laughter)With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.
时间：10:45
zh-cn:但是，当你看到孩子们完成功课每一天都能受到大人们的悉心指导回到家后，已经不需为功课而烦恼不需坐在电视机前面写作业每天下午五点半就可以回家，跟家人共度美好时光做自己爱干的事情，或者是到外面去玩这样一来我们不就有一个和谐的家庭了吗？社区里的和谐家庭多了，社区不也更和睦吗？只要这样的和睦社区越来越多，我们不是有希望看到一个和平的都市以及和平的世界吗？所以说，一切的关键在于让孩子完成作业！还有，一对一的专注辅导
en:But you know, there&#39;s something about the kids finishing their homeworkin a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention —they go home, they&#39;re finished. They don&#39;t stall.They don&#39;t do their homework in front of the TV.They&#39;re allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family,enjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.And that makes a happy family.A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.So the key to it all is homework! (Laughter) (Applause)There you have it, you know — one-on-one attention.
时间：11:18
zh-cn:我们一开始有12名志愿者后来有50人再后来就增加到了几百人现在，有1400个志愿者加入了我们我们力求让志愿者的参与变得非常简单最重要一点是，哪怕你每个月才能挤出两个小时的空余时间那用来做一对一辅导已经足够你就坐在孩子的旁边给孩子以指点让孩子在思想上和表达上变得更优秀这样的片刻对于孩子而言是具有洗心革面之意义的因为很多孩子从来都没有过这样的体验所以我们说，“即便你每半年只有两小时的空余时间也不要紧，那已经足够了。也正是因为这样的安排，我们的志愿者队伍增长很快
en:So we started off with about 12 volunteers,and then we had about 50,and then a couple hundred.And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month,those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder,next to one student, concentrated attention,shining this beam of light on their work,on their thoughts and their self-expression,is going to be absolutely transformative,because so many of the students have not had that ever before.So we said, &quot;Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months,it doesn&#39;t matter. That&#39;s going to be enough.&quot;So that&#39;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast.
时间：11:55
zh-cn:后来我们想，白天的时间是不是也把辅导中心利用起来是不是在下午两点半孩子放学之前也把这地方用起来所以我们决定要在日间开课每天，都会有孩子来到这里做实习，在大人的指导下写书你可以看到屏幕上显示的就是他们写的书这是其中一个班，他们还真的为写作而疯狂呢不管什么时候，你拿着一台摄像机对着孩子，总会见到这样的表情并且这样的表情长期如此这是他们做成的一本书大家注意看那书名《从未被借出的一本书：泰坦尼克》书的第一句话是这样的：从前，有一本书，书名叫《辛迪》写的是“泰坦尼克”的故事此外，我们还有大人坐在后面把这些文字敲到电脑里一切都十分认真，简直是把孩子乐坏了
en:Then we said, &quot;Well, what are wegoing to do with the space during the day,because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?&quot;So we started bringing in classes during the day.So every day, there&#39;s a field trip where they together create a book —you can see it being typed up above.This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.You just point a camera at a class,and it always looks like this.So this is one of the books that they do.Notice the title of the book,&quot;The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic.&quot;And the first line of that book is, &quot;Once there was a book named Cindythat was about the Titanic.&quot;So, meanwhile, there&#39;s an adult in the back typing this up,taking it completely seriously, which blows their mind.
时间：12:42
zh-cn:不过，我们的志愿者人数还是很多这是某次活动上的照片我们跟老师紧密合作老师们知道该怎么做我们就在一旁听我说，“我们的人都是很灵活的，你们要我们怎么做我们就怎么做。”我们也会听家长的意见老师们会告诉我们怎么做才能最大限度的发挥志愿者的作用
en:So then we still had more tutors to use.This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.The teachers that we work with —and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do.We went in there thinking,&quot;We&#39;re ultimately, completely malleable. You&#39;re going to tell us.The neighborhood&#39;s going to tell us, the parents are going to tell us.The teachers are going to tell us how we&#39;re most useful.&quot;
时间：13:01
zh-cn:有一次，他们问：你们是不是也把志愿者派到学校里去啊？因为总会有一些孩子没办法来你们这里啊比如说，有些家长自己不甚积极或者是孩子家住得比较远？于是我们想，我们有1400多位志愿者假如有老师跟我们联系说接下来的五个星期我的课堂需要12名志愿者因为我们要准备大学入学申请的论文。你们把志愿者叫过来吧于是我们就把消息发布出去只要是有空闲的都可以报名。他们只需在课前半个钟到课室就行了老师会告诉他们该做些什么如何做：课堂内容是什么，要达到什么教学目的志愿者在老师的指导之下开展辅导他们到一个大课室这现已成为我们做得最大的一件事志愿者直接由家里、公司来到学校直接走进课堂跟学生一起工作通过这样的方式，我们能够接触到更多的学生接着又有一所学校跟我们说，“我们腾出一间教室给你们用怎么样？”你们可以把志愿者请过来，一整天都用那个教室啊？
en:So then they said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you come into the schools?Because what about the students that wouldn&#39;t come to you,necessarily, who don&#39;t have really active parents that are bringing them in,or aren&#39;t close enough?&quot; So then we started saying,&quot;Well, we&#39;ve got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.Let&#39;s just put out the word.&quot; A teacher will say,&quot;I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.We&#39;re working on our college essays. Send them in.&quot;So we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.The teacher tells them what to do,how to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.They work under the teacher&#39;s guide,and it&#39;s all in one big room.And that&#39;s actually the brunt of what we do is,people going straight from their workplace, straight from home,straight into the classroom andworking directly with the students.So then we&#39;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students.Then another school said, &quot;Well, what if wejust give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?&quot;
时间：13:53
zh-cn:这是埃维雷特高中的写作室那里也装点成海盗店的模样它就在图书馆隔壁，我们可以给529名学生提供写作课程就是整一个学校的学生这是他们做的报纸，叫《有话直说》上面有来自市长纽绅的专栏并且是以英语西班牙语双语写的有一天我们收到伊丝贝拉（Isabel Allende）的信，她说，“你们怎么不给孩子们布置一个写书的任务啊？我希望看到孩子是怎么想象一个和平的世界的于是我们来到图耳鼓·马绍尔高中我们曾经和那个高中有过合作我们向学生布置了这个作业我们对孩子说，你们写的每一个字，伊丝贝拉都会去阅读她会把你们的文章做成一本书她还会资助你们出版你们的书将会在旧金山一带的书店上买得到或者是通过亚马逊在线书店，在全球任何一个角落都能购买于是孩子们干的很用劲他们之前干任何事情都没有这么认真因为他们知道有一个潜在的读者还有伊丝贝拉我记得我们一共有170位志愿者参与了这个项目这个项目运行非常顺利最后我们还开了一个庆功会现在你在很多地方都能找到这书了。由此也开启了一系列的项目谭恩美就表示要支持下一本书的出版那书叫《也许我能到达某地》于是这成为了一个长期的项目，我们也出了很多书
en:So this is the Everett Middle School Writers&#39; Room,where we decorated it in buccaneer style.It&#39;s right off the library. And there we serveall 529 kids in this middle school.This is their newspaper, the &quot;Straight-Up News,&quot;that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsomin both languages — English and Spanish.So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said,&quot;Hey, why don&#39;t you assign a book with high school students?I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world.&quot;And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School,which is a school that we had worked with on some other things,and we gave that assignment to the students.And we said, &quot;Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.She&#39;s going to publish them in a book.She&#39;s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.It&#39;s going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Areaand throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it.&quot;So these kids worked harderthan they&#39;ve ever worked on anything in their lives,because there was that outside audience,there was Isabel Allende on the other end.I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with themand so this worked out incredibly well.We had a big party at the end.This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these.You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one,&quot;I Might Get Somewhere.&quot;And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books.
时间：15:10
zh-cn:甚至是变得有点出书成瘾了孩子们为了出书也会做得非常认真因为他们知道那将会成为一种具有长久意义的东西。知道他们写的书会出现在书架上他们所想所写的东西没有人能够磨灭我们尊重他们的表达以及他们的思想他们花了几百个小时进行创作 前后改了五六遍我们一直都在支持孩子们去表达自己的想法而一旦他们的写作能力达到了一定的水平通常就不会下降了这样的辅导对于孩子而言具有洗心革面的意义孩子的书摆在店卖 就放在木板旁边这些书全都卖光了你还能想象把这些书放在别的地方吗我们把书都卖了 可是发生了奇怪的事情就是我们这个辅导中心旁边的这店虽然我们一开始的时候开这店只是为了好玩但现在它居然也给我们带来利润了 我们就用这个来付房租也许这是只有在旧金山才会发生的怪事吧我也不知道 也不想评论但人们确实是会来到这里并且那时候《加勒比海盗》还没有上映呢就因为如此 这店给我们带来了许多收益我们拿那些钱交租 也给这里的一位全职员工发工资左边那个是海洋地图
en:Now we&#39;re sort of addicted to the book thing.The kids will work harder than they&#39;ve ever worked in their lifeif they know it&#39;s going to be permanent,know it&#39;s going to be on a shelf,know that nobody can diminish what they&#39;ve thought and said,that we&#39;ve honored their words, honored their thoughtswith hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts —all this attention that we give to their thoughts.And once they achieve that level, once they&#39;ve written at that level,they can never go back.It&#39;s absolutely transformative.And so then they&#39;re all sold in the store. This is near the planks.We sell all the student books.Where else would you put them, right?So we sell &#39;em, and then something weird had been happeningwith the stores. The store, actually —even though we started out as just a gag — the store actually made money.So it was paying the rent.And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing —I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t want to judge.But people would come in —and this was before the pirate movies and everything!It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money,but it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.There&#39;s the ocean maps you can see on the left.

zh-cn:这里就成为了社区的一个窗口人们经常进来问这里是搞 xx 什么的啊 这里我不说那个字了这是常规吗 我也不清楚他们会问 这是什么？进来的人们都会学到一些东西而就在店的旁边他们就会看到孩子正在上课正好有个写作班正在上课 他们就在这里买东西他们更多的是买一些喂鸟的食物也有买钩子的还有买钩子保护器的 反正就是我们这里的古怪的东西我们可以说 这店办得还挺好的可是来的人太多了教师、慈善人士、志愿者 什么人都有因为那正好就在街角 并且是对外开放的而不是像一些公益组织那样 隐藏在市中心30层高的大楼深处它就在社区里就是给社区提供服务的 并且时刻都向社区开放这时候 奇怪的事情又发生了
en:And it became a gateway to the community.People would come in and say, &quot;What the —?What is this?&quot; I don&#39;t want to swear on the web. (Laughter)Is that a rule? I don&#39;t know.They would say, &quot;What is this?&quot;And people would come in and learn more about it.And then right beyond — there&#39;s usually a little chain there —right beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping,and they might be more likely to buy some lard,or millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook,or hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.So the store actually did really well.But it brought in so many people —teachers, donors, volunteers, everybody —because it was street level. It was open to the public.It wasn&#39;t a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floorof some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhoodthat it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.

zh-cn:我过去在布鲁克林认识的那些朋友他们也想搞个这样的辅导机构并且他们很多以前就是当教师的或者是马上就要成为教师的于是他们联合当地的一些设计师 教师所有的点子都是他们自己想的一切都是他们自己亲力亲为不过他们不想卖海盗用品因为那边没有这个需求但是他们想到了纽约市经常搞反暴力活动于是就开设了布鲁克林超级英雄专卖店这是山姆·博茨设计的他特意设计成这个模样就是仿照五金店 让人感觉里面应有尽有想买什么都能找到于是这店开张了 里面有如一家百货公司各种简单的英雄装备都有并且是手工制作的大多是废物利用而所有的包装都是出自山姆·博茨的手
en:So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said,&quot;Well, why don&#39;t we have a place like that here?&quot;And a lot of them had been former educatorsor would-be educators, so they combinedwith a lot of local designers, local writers,and they just took the idea independentlyand they did their own thing.They didn&#39;t want to sell pirate supplies.They didn&#39;t think that that was going to work there.So, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York,they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.This is Sam Potts&#39; great design that did this.And this was to make it look sort of like one of thosekeysmith&#39;s shops that has to have every servicethey&#39;ve ever offered, you know, all over there.So they opened this place. Inside, it&#39;s like a Costcofor superheroes — all the supplies in kind of basic form.These are all handmade.These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.All the packaging is done by Sam Potts.

zh-cn:还有这个困兽笼子孩子们把自己的父母丢到里面去 还有办公室还有这里 你把商品交给店员商品就随着升降机上升柜台后面那个店员就会告诉你要作一番英雄宣誓凡是要买东西的 都必须宣誓 这个也多少影响了他们的收入我个人以为那是一个问题毕竟他们做这些商品花了不少心机看这些就是他们的商品 都是手工制作的这是秘密身份认证卡片假如你想充当Sharon Boone她是来自于新泽西州霍伯昆的营销经理这里一整个箱子都是关于 Sharon Boone的东西这个是披肩的外披穿上以后 你踏上这个三层的台阶我们就拧开风扇开关看 那披肩神起来了不过也许披肩会鼓起来那就最不如意了还有这个秘密门你刚进来的时候不会看到的但是进来后你会慢慢发现在一大堆钩子中间 你会发现这个门门的后面就是辅导中心这就是全景
en:So then you have the villain containment unit,where kids put their parents. You have the office.This is a little vault — you have to put your product in there,it goes up an electric liftand then the guy behind the counter tells youthat you have to recite the vow of heroism,which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.Personally, I think it&#39;s a problem.Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything.These are some of the products. These are all handmade.This is a secret identity kit.If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone,one American female marketing executivefrom Hoboken, New Jersey. It&#39;s a full dossieron everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape,and then you walk up these three steel-graded stepsand then we turn on three hydraulic fansfrom every side and then you can see the cape in action.There&#39;s nothing worse than, you know,getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.So then, the secret door —this is one of the shelves you don&#39;t seewhen you walk in, but it slowly opens.You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back. (Applause)So you can see the full effect!

zh-cn:这一切 我想强调说都是当地人自己筹款 自己建起来的所有的设计以及建造都是靠本地人 并且是秉持公益的原则我刚去过那边 对他们说 你们做得真棒反正就是这么说你可以在墙上看到纽约市的五个时区在不同的辅导课程之间是有时间间隔的每天都很忙 他们会坚持一些原则如一对一的辅导 全身心的关注孩子的作业洋溢着乐观情绪以及创意这个想法就是他们在走访店铺的时候想到的那是一个学校 又不是一个学校很显然它不是一所学校但是老师和孩子却是肩并肩的在一起学习
en:But this is — I just want to emphasize —locally funded, locally built.All the designers, all of the builders,everybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.I just came and visited and said, &quot;Yes, you guys are doing great,&quot;or whatever. That was it. You can see the timein all five boroughs of New York in the back. (Laughter) (Applause)So this is the space during tutoring hours.It&#39;s very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention,complete devotion to the students&#39; workand a boundless optimism and sort of a possibilityof creativity and ideas.And this switch is flicked in their headswhen they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?So it&#39;s school, but it&#39;s not school.It&#39;s clearly not school, even thoughthey&#39;re working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever.

zh-cn:我们有个孩子 叫卡雷德·翰丹你可以看看这段话我以前沉迷于电子游戏和电视 在家里不能集中精神后来我到了这里 得到了老师的密切关照他就再也离不开这里了不久后 他开始写东西了 他可以很早的完成功课并且非常认真的去做功课要知道 做这事情是会变得上瘾的他还可以让老师帮他看作业做得对不对这样他就能更好的准备第二天的课简直是做作业上瘾了 后来还做了别的事情现在他已经出了五本书还与别人合作写了个搞笑剧本 讲述失败的英雄故事剧本的名字是“昨日英雄”他还写了个企鹅勇士系列讲述一种擅长打架的企鹅的故事几周前 他在交响乐空间那里大声念给500人听那是“826纽约”给予他的奖励现在他每天都去 还向别人宣传“826纽约” 也把自己的妹妹带到那里了每天一家四口都会来
en:This is one of the students, Khaled Hamdan.You can read this quote.Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn&#39;t concentrate at home.Came in. Got this concentrated attention.And he couldn&#39;t escape it.So, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early —got really addicted to finishing his homework early.It&#39;s an addictive thing to sort of be done with it,and to have it checked, and to know he&#39;s going to achievethe next thing and be prepared for school the next day.So he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.He&#39;s now been published in five books.He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroescalled &quot;Super-Has-Beens.&quot;He wrote a series on &quot;Penguin Balboa,&quot;which is a fighting — a boxing — penguin.And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space,at a benefit for 826 New York. So he&#39;s there every day.He&#39;s evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now.There&#39;s four family members that come in every day.

zh-cn:并且这一切都可以是好玩的 这就是这个演讲之精髓不是固定一个模式 也不必怕官僚作风你完全可以运用你的技能去参与学校需要你 老师需要你学生以及家长也需要你 他们要你站在他们身边也希望得到你在心灵上给予他们指导只要你用心去倾听 再加上一颗同情心坐在孩子身边 给予他们肯定的暗示每次是一连几个小时 回答孩子的疑问有些孩子其实就是不知道自己能力是多么强啊也不知道其实他们是多么聪明 有那么多话要说你可以告诉他们 你可以成为他们成长的明灯每次就一对一的关怀 希望大家能够一起合作 帮助孩子谢谢
en:And it can be fun! That&#39;s the point of this talk —it needn&#39;t be sterile. It needn&#39;t be bureaucratically untenable.You can do and use the skills that you have.The schools need you. The teachers need you.Students and parents need you. They need your actual person:your physical personhood and your open mindsand open ears and boundless compassion,sitting next to them, listening and noddingand asking questions for hours at a time.Some of these kids just don&#39;t plain know how good they are:how smart and how much they have to say.You can tell them. You can shine that light on them,one human interaction at a time. So we hope you&#39;ll join us.Thank you so much.
