zh-cn:在过去的二十年里，印度已经成为全球软件开发以及离岸后台服务的中心我们希望了解的是这个庞大的产业自二十年前在印度崛起由于离岸软件开发和后台服务白领工作岗位也因此从发达国家转移到印度加上制造业岗位外包到中国，正如你所知道的，造成了相当程度的来自西方社会的焦虑
en:Over the last two decades, India has becomea global hub for software developmentand offshoring of back office services, as we call it,and what we were interested in finding out was thatbecause of this huge industry that has startedover the last two decades in India,offshoring software development and back office services,there&#39;s been a flight of white collar jobsfrom the developed world to India.When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobsto China, it has, you know, led to considerable angstamongst the Western populations.

zh-cn:事实上，调查数据显示在西方，对自由贸易的支持者人数正在下降但是，如今，西方的精英指出这是一种错位的恐惧我举个例子，如果你读过，我想很多观众都看过，Thomas Friedman的书书名是《地球是平的》，其中谈到对于自由贸易的恐惧是错误的因为这个观点来自一个错误的假设那就是一切的发明创造皆已完成而实际上，作者说，西方社会领先发展中国家的优势来自于创新当更复杂，更新颖的任务在发达国家完成以后，那些较简单或者说辛苦的工作就被转移到发展中国家
en:In fact, if you look at polls, they show a decliningtrend for support for free trade in the West.Now, the Western elites, however, have saidthis fear is misplaced.For example, if you have read — I suspect many of youhave done so — read the book by Thomas Friedmancalled &quot;The World Is Flat,&quot; he said, basically, in his bookthat, you know, this fear for free trade is wrongbecause it assumes, it&#39;s based on a mistaken assumptionthat everything that can be invented has been invented.In fact, he says, it&#39;s innovation that will keep the Westahead of the developing world,with the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being donein the developed world, and the less sophisticated,shall we say, drudge work being donein the developing world.

zh-cn:那我们想搞清楚的就是，这个的观点正确吗？印度能否成为创新的源泉或全球中心就像成为后台服务和软件开发的中心一样？过去的四年里，我和合著者 Phanish Puranam就在研究这个课题
en:Now, what we were trying to understand was,is this true?Could India become a source, or a global hub,of innovation, just like it&#39;s become a global hubfor back office services and software development?And for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranamand I spent investigating this topic.
时间： 2:04
zh-cn:开始是，正如你们所知到的，人们会说特别是支持西方创新理论模型的拥护者他们说”印度的Googles, iPods,和Viagras在哪里如果印度人真有那么聪明的话？“
en:Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know,in fact the more aggressive people who are supportingthe Western innovative model, say,&quot;Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras,if the Indians are so bloody smart?&quot; (Laughter)
时间： 2:19
zh-cn:所以起初，在最开始的研究阶段我们去拜访数位高管，向他们提问”您觉得，印度是否可能从软件和后台服务的目的地转型成为创新的目的地呢？“他们笑了，并把我们请出门有的会说”你知道吗？印度人不会创新“比较有礼貌的版本是”印度人有当出色的程序远和会计师的天赋，但他们没有创造力“
en:So initially, when we started our research, we wentand met several executives, and we asked them,&quot;What do you think? Will India go from being a favoreddestination for software services and back office servicesto a destination for innovation?&quot;They laughed. They dismissed us.They said, &quot;You know what? Indians don&#39;t do innovation.&quot;The more polite ones said, &quot;Well, you know, Indiansmake good software programmers and accountants,but they can&#39;t do the creative stuff.&quot;
时间： 2:45
zh-cn:有时候，表达方式更委婉一些人们会说”不是印度人的问题是僵化的教育体系的错是条条框框抹杀了创意“所以他们建议，如果要了解创造力要去硅谷，去参观Google (谷歌), Microsoft (微软)和Intel(英特尔)这样的公司
en:Sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication,and people said, &quot;You know, it&#39;s nothing to do with Indians.It&#39;s really the rule-based, regimented education systemin India that is responsible for killing all creativity.&quot;They said, instead, if you want to see real creativity,go to Silicon Valley, and look at companieslike Google, Microsoft, Intel.
时间： 3:07
zh-cn:所以我们就开始研究硅谷的研发中心和创新实验室有意思的是，在那里我们发现通常创新实验室或者研发中心的一把手往往就是一个印度人
en:So we started examining the R&amp;D and innovation labsof Silicon Valley.Well, interestingly, what you find there is,usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation labor the R&amp;D center as they may call it,and more often than not, it&#39;s an Indian. (Laughter)
时间： 3:23
zh-cn:当然我们的第一反应是”您一定不是在印度接受教育的吧？您一定是在这里上的学吧？”结果，每一次他们其实都是印度教育的产物于是我们意识到我们没有问对问题正确的问题其实是， 印度的印度人可以创新吗？
en:So I immediately said, &quot;Well, but you could not have beeneducated in India, right?You must have gotten your education here.&quot;It turned out, in every single case,they came out of the Indian educational system.So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question,and the right question is, really, can Indiansbased out of India do innovative work?
时间： 3:46
zh-cn:于是我们飞往印度我们多次到班加罗尔(Bangalore), 孟买 (Mumbai), 古尔加翁(Gurgaon)德里(Delhi), 海得拉巴(Hyderabad)等地， 探寻这些城市的商业创新程度我们的发现是，随着研究的深入看来提出的问题本身的确是不对的当有人问“印度的谷歌iPods和伟哥在哪里？“时，提问者的立场是站在终端用户角度而言的创新是看得见的创新
en:So off we went to India. We made, I think,about a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon,Delhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examinewhat is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.And what we found was, as we progressed in our research,was, that we were asking really the wrong question.When you ask, &quot;Where are the Indian Googles,iPods and Viagras?&quot; you are taking a particular perspectiveon innovation, which is innovation for end users,visible innovation.
时间： 4:16
zh-cn:而其实，如果你还记得，也许你们读过著名的经济学家熊彼得(Schumpeter)的著作他说“创新是用新的方式创造和分配价值”它既可以是新的产品和服务也可以是不一样的制造产品的方法还可以是崭新的企业和行业的组织形式
en:Instead, innovation, if you remember, some of youmay have read the famous economist Schumpeter,he said, &quot;Innovation is noveltyin how value is created and distributed.&quot;It could be new products and services,but it could also be new ways of producing products.It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.
时间： 4:35
zh-cn:按照这种理论，创新就不仅仅局限于受益于创新的终端用户当你从广义角度定义创新时你就会发现，印度其实处处有创新，只是印度的创新形式并不是人们所预期的，我们把它称之为隐形的创新具体地说，印度式创新又可分为四个类别
en:Once you take this, there&#39;s no reason to restrict innovation,the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation,what we found was, India is well representedin innovation, but the innovation that is being done in Indiais of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did waswe called it &quot;invisible innovation.&quot;And specifically, there are four types of invisible innovationthat are coming out of India.
时间： 5:03
zh-cn:其一是对商业顾客的创新这是由跨国企业引领的在过去二十年里由跨国公司在印度建立的研发中心达750个雇佣了超过40万名专业人士当我们考虑到跨国公司的研发中心历来都设在公司总部，或者初始国所以位于印度的750所跨国公司的研发中心这个数字是惊人的
en:The first type of invisible innovation out of Indiais what we call innovation for business customers,which is led by the multinational corporations,which have — in the last two decades, there have been750 R&amp;D centers set up in India by multinational companiesemploying more than 400,000 professionals.Now, when you consider the fact that, historically,the R&amp;D center of a multinational companywas always in the headquarters, or in the country of originof that multinational company, to have 750 R&amp;D centersof multinational corporations in Indiais truly a remarkable figure.
时间： 5:46
zh-cn:当我们去到这些研发中心并对里面的工作人员进行访谈询问他们在做什么时他们回答“我们做的是全球性的产品”他们并不是在本地化全球性产品来适应印度市场，这通常就是地方性研发中心的角色他们做的是真正的全球性产品而诸如微软，谷歌，阿斯利康制药厂(AstraZeneca)通用电器，飞利浦这样的企业已经肯定的回应他们在班加罗尔和海德拉巴的研发中心足以胜任为全球市场开发产品和提供服务当让，作为终端用户，这是你看不到的因为你看到的仅仅是公司的名字而不是产品的研发地
en:When we went and talked to the people in those innovationcenters and asked them what are they working on,they said, &quot;We are working on global products.&quot;They were not working on localizing global productsfor India, which is the usual role of a local R&amp;D.They were working on truly global products,and companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca,General Electric, Philips, have already answeredin the affirmative the question that from their Bangaloreand Hyderabad R&amp;D centers they are able to produceproducts and services for the world.But of course, as an end user, you don&#39;t see that,because you only see the name of the company,not where it was developed.
时间： 6:27
zh-cn:也有人对我们说“即便如此，这些来自印度研发中心的产品还是比不上那些来自美国研发中心的产品。”有鉴于此，我的合著人Phanish Puranam，他刚好也是我所认识的最聪明的人，他说他要做一个研究对象是在美国和印度同时拥有研发中心的公司看看那些在美国提交的专利申请和同一公司在印度分支机构提出的类似专利申请这样来比较同一公司位于美国和印度提交的专利申请希望评估印度提交的专利申请的质量以及跟美国提交的那些申请的含金量的差异
en:The other thing we were told then was, &quot;Yes, but, you know,the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&amp;D centercannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming outof the U.S. R&amp;D centers.&quot;So my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to beone of the smartest people I know, saidhe&#39;s going to do a study.What he did was he looked at those companiesthat had an R&amp;D center in USA and in India,and then he looked at a patent that was filedout of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the samecompany&#39;s subsidiary in India,so he&#39;s now comparing the patents of R&amp;D centersin the U.S. with R&amp;D centers in India of the same companyto find out what is the quality of the patents filedout of the Indian centers and how do they comparewith the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?
时间： 7:10
zh-cn:有趣的是，他发现顺便一提的是，我们比较专利质量的方法是引用前人(forward citations): 就是看后来的专利对之前的专利的引用次数他的发现非常有意思我们的数据表明在同一家公司，来自美国研发中心的专利申请的被引用次数和印度研发中心的是一模一样的换而言之，在一家公司印度和美国分公司的专利引用率是一样的这是第一种印度式创新
en:Interestingly, what he finds is— and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patentis what we call forward citations: How many timesdoes a future patent reference the older patent? —he finds something very interesting.What we find is that the data saysthat the number of forward citations of a patent filedout of a U.S. R&amp;D subsidiary is identical to the numberof forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiaryof the same company within that company.So within the company, there&#39;s no difference in the forwardcitation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versustheir U.S. subsidiaries.So that&#39;s the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India.
时间： 7:50
zh-cn:第二种来自印度的创新我们称之为外包创新如今很多公司都把产品开发的主要部分外包给印度公司服务于他们的全球性产品再卖给全世界比方说，制药行业在开发很多分子其中的很大一部分是在印度完成的比如XCL Technologies公司他们为波音公司新的787客机开发其中两个关键的航行系统一个防止飞行相撞另一个用于实现零能见度着陆当然，当你登上波音787客机时是不可能觉察到这些隐形的来自印度的创新的
en:The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of Indiais what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies,where many companies today are contractingIndian companies to do a major part of their productdevelopment work for their global productswhich are going to be sold to the entire world.For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the moleculesare being developed, but you see a major part of that workis being sent to India.For example, XCL Technologies,they developed two of the mission critical systemsfor the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner,one to avoid collisions in the sky,and another to allow landing in zero visibility.But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787,you are not going to know that this is invisible innovationout of India.
时间： 8:39
zh-cn:第三种印度式创新是基于印度公司的才智而产生的过程创新过程创新和产品创新是不一样的它是关于新产品开发，创造或生产的流程的创新而不是产品本身
en:The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of Indiais what we call process innovations, because of an injectionof intelligence by Indian firms.Process innovation is different from product innovation.It&#39;s about how do you create a new product or developa new product or manufacture a new product,but not a new product itself?
时间： 8:59
zh-cn:只有在印度才有上百万的年轻人向往在呼叫中心工作在西方，这样的工作是没有出头之日的是中学辍学者才做的事当你把成千上万名聪明年轻又雄心勃勃的年轻人放在一个呼叫中心里，会出现什么情况呢？不用多久，他们就感到无聊开始想新的点子然后就开始跟老板说如何能更好地完成工作而这个流程地创新则带来了产品地创新再被推广到世界其他地方
en:Only in India do millions of young people dreamof working in a call center.What happens — You know, it&#39;s a dead end job in the West,what high school dropouts do.What happens when you put hundreds of thousandsof smart, young, ambitious kidson a call center job?Very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating,and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, andout of this process innovation comes product innovations,which are then marketed around the world.
时间： 9:36
zh-cn:其中的例子如24/7 Customer (全天候客服公司）传统的呼叫中心公司，沿用的是固有的形式。而今天他们开发的分析工具可以进行模型预测在拿起话筒前就能猜测或预计这通来电的内容这都是由于对西方长期认为没有前景的行业的流程加入了有智慧的改进
en:For example, 24/7 Customer,traditional call center company, used to be a traditionalcall center company. Today they&#39;re developinganalytical tools to do predictive modeling so that beforeyou pick up the phone, you can guessor predict what this phone call is about.It&#39;s because of an injection of intelligence into a processwhich was considered dead for a long time in the West.
时间：10:01
zh-cn:最后一种印度式的隐形创新我们称之为管理创新它不是产品和流程的创新而是工作安排的创新而来自印度的最著名的管理创新是由外包行业提供的全球服务模式在这个模式下，可以实现把从前受地理位置局限的任务细化再分发给世界各地的专业人士手上或者成本结构适宜的地区再列明重新整合以上服务的方式缺了这个模式，今天的其他任何一个隐形创新都无法实现
en:And the last kind of innovation, invisible innovationcoming out of India is what we call management innovation.It&#39;s not a new product or a new processbut a new way to organize work,and the most significant management innovation to comeout of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industryis what we call the global delivery model.What the global delivery model allows is, it allows youto take previously geographically core-located tasks,break them up into parts, send them around the worldwhere the expertise and the cost structure exists,and then specify the means for reintegrating them.Without that, you could not have any of the otherinvisible innovations today.
时间：10:37
zh-cn:所以我想说的是，我们的研究发现如果说终端用户手中的产品是创新之中看得见的冰山一角的话那印度的创新则是隐没在水下的更为巨大的部分
en:So, what I&#39;m trying to say is, what we are findingin our research is, that if products for end usersis the visible tip of the innovation iceberg,India is well represented in the invisible, large,submerged portion of the innovation iceberg.
时间：10:57
zh-cn:当然这个也带来了启示我们归结为三点第一, 下降的技能阶梯让我回到对话的开头谈到岗位流失的时候当然，一开始，跨国公司决定要外包服务到印度的研发中心时我们是把业务中最低端的部分外包出去，那些都是最简单的工作跟Tom Friedman预测的是一样的
en:Now, this has, of course, some implications,and so we developed three implications of this research.The first is what we called sinking skill ladder,and now I&#39;m going to go back to where I started myconversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company,decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&amp;D,what we are going to do is we are going to outsource thebottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs,just like Tom Friedman would predict.
时间：11:31
zh-cn:当你把最底下的工作外包到印度进行创新和研发后不久，未来的某个时刻将要面对一个问题往上一层的员工在公司内部从何而来呢？有两个选择要么把印度的人才提拔到发达国家通过移民不然你也可以说既然在印度有这么多从事底层职位的人员等待升迁何不干脆把提升的职位也转移到印度去？
en:Now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rungof the ladder to India for innovation and for R&amp;D work,at some stage in the very near future you are going to haveto confront a problem,which is where does the next stepof the ladder people come from within your company?So you have two choices then:Either you bring the people from India intothe developed world to take positions in the next stepof the ladder — immigration —or you say, there&#39;s so many people in the bottom stepof the ladder waiting to take the next position in India,why don&#39;t we move the next step to India?
时间：12:09
zh-cn:我们想说的是一旦职业阶梯底层的工作外包出去由于阶梯下移，自然而然跟其他简单的逻辑一样要成为投资银行家就要先当一个分析员要当教授就要先做一回学生要当咨询师就必须有当研究员的经历所以简单的工作被外包后某个时刻，它上面的职位就要跟随这个趋势
en:What we are trying to say isthat once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you —it&#39;s a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder,and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point thatyou can&#39;t be an investment bankerwithout having been an analyst once.You can&#39;t be a professor without having been a student.You can&#39;t be a consultant without having been a research associate.So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs,at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.
时间：12:38
zh-cn:此外，我们想提一下TMT (高级管理团队)的亚洲化假设未来研发中心将设在印度和中国，而增长最快的市场也将是这两个国家的话你要面临的问题是未来你的高级管理人员必然来自印度和中国因为那是产品领导力市场领导力的来源
en:The second thing we bring up is what we callthe browning of the TMT, the top management teams.If the R&amp;D talent is going to be based out of Indiaand China, and the largest growth marketsare going to be based out of India and China,you have to confront the problem thatyour top management of the futureis going to have to come out of India and China,because that&#39;s where the product leadership is,that&#39;s where the important market leadership is.
时间：13:01
zh-cn:对吧？最后我想说的是这里还有一个警示印度拥有全球最年轻的人口这个人口红利是巨大的 但相对的也造成强劲的劳动力市场这个幻境印度的教育机构和教育体系大部分无法培养足够数量的合格人才来满足持续创新的需求所以企业也在寻找解决这个问题的新路子但终究，教育结构的创新是政府不可推卸的责任
en:Right? And the last thing we point out in this slide,which is, you know, that to this story, there&#39;s one caveat.India has the youngest growing population in the world.This demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically,there&#39;s also the mirage of mighty labor pools.Indian institutes and educational system,with a few exceptions, are incapable of producing studentsin the quantity and quality neededto keep this innovation engine going,so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this,but in the end it does not absolve the governmentof the responsibility for creating this educational structure.
时间：13:39
zh-cn:最后，我希望通过IBM公司的情况来总结很多人都知道，IBM一直是在过去一个世纪以来最具创新意识的公司之一实际上，如果翻看专利申请数量的历史我想他们是位居榜首或前几名的专利申请公司，在美国的私人企业当中
en:So finally, I want to concludeby showing you the profile of one company, IBM.As many of you know, IBM has always been consideredfor the last hundred years to be one of the mostinnovative companies.In fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history,I think they are in the top or the top two or three companiesin the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company.
时间：14:00
zh-cn:这个是该公司过去十年的员工构成表2003年，他们有30万名员工或者说33万员工里面13.5万在美国9千在印度到2009年 他们有40万名员工 此时美国的员工数字变为10.5万而印度的数字则升到10万
en:Here is the profile of employees ofIBM over the last decade.In 2003, they had 300,000 employees,or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000were in America, 9,000 were in India.In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which timethe U.S. employees had moved to 105,000,whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.
时间：14:28
zh-cn:到2010年他们决定不再公布这个统计，所以我自己做了点估算在各种数据的基础上这是我能做的最佳估算。这并不是确切的数字 而是我的最佳估算让你能感知发展趋势现在IBM有43.3万名员工 其中9.8万仍在美国而15万在印度请你告诉我，IBM是一家美国公司还是印度公司(笑声)
en:Well, in 2010, they decided they&#39;re not going to revealthis data anymore, so I had to make some estimatesbased on various sources.Here are my best guesses. Okay? I&#39;m not sayingthis is the exact number, it&#39;s my best guess.It gives you a sense of the trend.There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which98,000 are remaining in the U.S.,and 150,000 are in India.So you tell me, is IBM an American company,or an Indian company? (Laughter)

zh-cn:女士们先生们 谢谢各位(掌声)
en:Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. (Applause)
