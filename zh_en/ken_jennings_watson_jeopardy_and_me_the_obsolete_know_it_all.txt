zh-cn:再过两个星期，就是我第一次上电视玩‘危险’ 游戏的九周年纪念。九年是个很漫长的时间。鉴于‘危险’观众的平均年龄，我想这意味着大多数在那个节目上看到我的人现在已经死了。（笑声）但并不是所有的观众都过世了，还有人健在。偶尔仍然有人 在商场或其它地方认出我。他们仍记得我是‘万事通’。我认为木已成舟，为时已晚。不管我喜欢不喜欢，我就这么被定型了永远是那个知道很多稀奇古怪事情的家伙。
en:In two weeks time, that&#39;s the ninth anniversaryof the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed &quot;Jeopardy&quot; set.I mean, nine years is a long time.And given &quot;Jeopardy&#39;s&quot; average demographics,I think what that meansis most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead.(Laughter)But not all, a few are still alive.Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.And when I do, it&#39;s as a bit of a know-it-all.I think that ship has sailed, it&#39;s too late for me.For better or for worse, that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to be known as,as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff.

zh-cn:我对此并无怨言。我觉得那好似始终都是我的命运尽管多年来我一直沉迷在掌握百科知识。别的不说，作为一名少年，你很快就意识到知道科克船长的中名，并不能吸引女孩们的眼球。（笑声）也因此，有很多年,我一直是活在自己世界里的‘万事通’。但是，如果倒转时光，你就会发现，其实线索都在我小时候就总是缠着妈妈爸爸打听任何我那时刚刚读到任何信息— —哈雷彗星或巨型鱿鱼或是世界上最大的南瓜饼，不管什么事儿。我现在有个 10 多岁的孩子， 和我像极了。现在我知道被人无休止地追问是多么讨厌的事儿，真是报应。（笑声）
en:And I can&#39;t complain about this.I feel like that was always sort of my destiny,although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet.If nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager,it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk&#39;s middle name.(Laughter)And as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years.But if you go further back, if you look at it, it&#39;s all there.I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dadwith whatever great fact I had just read about —Haley&#39;s comet or giant squidsor the size of the world&#39;s biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.I now have a 10-year-old of my own who&#39;s exactly the same.And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.(Laughter)

zh-cn:我喜欢游戏节目，迷上了游戏节目。我记得，在 1979 年， 上幼儿园的第一天，我大哭因为我意识到，虽然我喜欢上学，但也会错过‘好莱坞广场’和‘家庭宿怨’两个游戏节目。我会错过我的游戏节目。后来，在八十年代中期，‘危险游戏’又重新开播，我记得每天从学校跑回家观看。早在我用这个节目支付的报酬购买房子之前，它就是我最喜欢的电视游戏节目。再说，当时，我们在海外居住，在韩国，我爸爸工作的地方，那里只有一个英语电视频道。电视上有武装部队节目如果你不会说韩语，那就是唯一看得懂的电视台。所以，我和我所有的朋友， 每天跑回家看‘危险’游戏。
en:And I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows.I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school,that I was also going to miss &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and &quot;Family Feud.&quot;I was going to miss my game shows.And later, in the mid-&#39;80s,when &quot;Jeopardy&quot; came back on the air,I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working,where there was only one English language TV channel.There was Armed Forces TV,and if you didn&#39;t speak Korean, that&#39;s what you were watching.So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch &quot;Jeopardy.&quot;

zh-cn:我总是那种痴迷百科知识的孩子。我记得，在八十年代，和父母玩儿‘琐细的追求’，当时是很时髦的， 我水平不错，可以抗衡我父母。当你知道一些妈妈和爸爸不知道的冷僻事儿，就会有种奇妙的优越感。当你知道一些爸爸都不知道的关于披头士的传闻，你会想，啊哈，知识就是力量知识的力量就在于恰到好处地运用正确的知识。
en:I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the &#39;80sand holding my own, back when that was a fad.There&#39;s a weird sense of mastery you getwhen you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don&#39;t know.You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn&#39;t know.And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power —the right fact deployed at exactly the right place.

zh-cn:从来没有那个指导顾问告诉我主修百科知识或者是前专业游戏节目参赛者可以当作正当的职业。我太年青，受人左右。没有试图搞清楚如何发挥特长，而是随大流，学了计算机，当了计算机程序员，表现尚可，虽然并不是特别突出。2004年，第一次上电视游戏节目‘危险’那时的我对生活也不满意可是当时那就是我的职业
en:I never had a guidance counselorwho thought this was a legitimate career path,that thought you could major in triviaor be a professional ex-game show contestant.And so I sold out way too young.I didn&#39;t try to figure out what one does with that.I studied computers because I heard that was the thing,and I became a computer programmer —not an especially good one,not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on &quot;Jeopardy&quot; in 2004.But that&#39;s what I was doing.

zh-cn:我的电脑背景 是个双重讽刺。几年后，我记得大概是2009年，‘危险‘游戏节目组 给我打电话说，&quot;现在为时尚早，但 IBM 告诉我们，他们想要建造一台超级计算机，与你竞赛‘危险’游戏。你接受吗?&quot;这是我第一次听说人机竞赛。当然，我答应了。原因有几个，第一，因为我享受玩‘危险’。它充满乐趣。除了做爱，玩‘危险’是最令人开心的。（笑声）我可以分文不收。幸好，我想他们不知道，可是麦当劳优惠券就足以让我去了。我就是爱玩‘危险’，我一直都是这样。还有因为我是个书呆子，而这看似是我的未来。我一直认为 人机在电视游戏节目上对抗是未来的趋势而且现在，我真的可以和计算机玩游戏了， 在电视上，我怎么能说不呢。
en:And it made it doubly ironic — my computer background —a few years later, I think 2009 or so,when I got another phone call from &quot;Jeopardy&quot; saying,&quot;It&#39;s early days yet, but IBM tells usthey want to build a supercomputer to beat you at &#39;Jeopardy.&#39;Are you up for this?&quot;This was the first I&#39;d heard of it.And of course I said yes, for several reasons.One, because playing &quot;Jeopardy&quot; is a great time.It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s the most fun you can have with your pants on.(Laughter)And I would do it for nothing.I don&#39;t think they know that, luckily,but I would go back and play for Arby&#39;s coupons.I just love &quot;Jeopardy,&quot; and I always have.And second of all, because I&#39;m a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.People playing computers on game showswas the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future,and now I could be on the stage with it.I was not going to say no.
时间： 3:54
zh-cn:第三个原因，是因为,我很有信心自己会赢。我上过一些人工智能课。我知道没有计算机具备玩‘危险’需要的能力。‘危险’中的线索是用人类语言表述的， 比如英语，它含有双关、 相似字、 隐语，编写计算程序来解谜这样的线索是十分艰难的。三、四岁小孩子能做的事对计算机来说是很难的。所以，我以为我会赢的轻而易举。是的，我会打败计算机，捍卫我的种群。（笑声）
en:The third reason I said yesis because I was pretty confident that I was going to win.I had taken some artificial intelligence classes.I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on &quot;Jeopardy.&quot;People don&#39;t realize how tough it is to write that kind of programthat can read a &quot;Jeopardy&quot; clue in a natural language like Englishand understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings,unpack the meaning of the clue.The kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do,very hard for a computer.And I thought, well this is going to be child&#39;s play.Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species.(Laughter)
时间： 4:34
zh-cn:但随着岁月的流逝，IBM 开始投入大笔金钱、人力和高速芯片。他们偶尔给我一些最新动态，我开始多一点担心。我记得有一篇杂志文章，专门讨论这台玩文字游戏的计算机，并附了一个图表，是一个散点图，绘制‘危险’参赛者的成绩在图表的顶部，数以万计的圆点代表‘危险’冠军的成绩他们的成绩是由- 我本想说是-答对问题的数目，但我觉得应该是被“质疑”的答案，反正就是将参赛者给予的答案— —与那些答案的准确性来做衡量。所以，计算机性能必须要达到一定水平刚开始时，它是非常低的。没有哪个软件可以在这样的舞台上竞争。但是，后来那条线开始上升。而它非常接近所谓的“优胜者区域&quot;我注意到在散点图的右上角有一些较暗的点，一些黑点，那是另一种颜色。我想，这是什么？&quot;中右上角的黑点代表 74 次‘危险’冠军肯.詹宁斯&quot;。那条代表计算机的线，朝我而来。我意识到，这下完了。这看起来就像大限将近。（笑声）它不是终结者的瞄准器 ；这是一条细线，逼近你的智力你的特长，最擅长的事。
en:But as the years went on,as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this,I started to get occasional updates from them,and I started to get a little more worried.I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.It was a scatter chart showing performance on &quot;Jeopardy,&quot;tens of thousands of dots representing &quot;Jeopardy&quot; champions up at the topwith their performance plotted on number of —I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess,clues responded to —versus the accuracy of those answers.So there&#39;s a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.And at first, it was very low.There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.But then you see the line start to go up.And it&#39;s getting very close to what they call the winner&#39;s cloud.And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chartsome darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.And thought, what are these?&quot;The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time &#39;Jeopardy&#39; champion Ken Jennings.&quot;And I saw this line coming for me.And I realized, this is it.This is what it looks like when the future comes for you.(Laughter)It&#39;s not the Terminator&#39;s gun sight;it&#39;s a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do,the only thing that makes you special, the thing you&#39;re best at.

zh-cn:最终，大约一年后，游戏开播。它和以往‘危险’游戏非常不同。通常我们在洛杉矶玩，但电脑沃森不能旅行。实际上，沃森体积庞大。它有数以千计的芯片，内存高达一兆兆字节，数万亿字节的内存。我们要走进有气候控制的服务器室。直到今天 沃森是里面唯一一个‘危险’选手。所以，沃森不能旅行。你必须来见它 ；您必须来”朝拜“。
en:And when the game eventually happened about a year later,it was very different than the &quot;Jeopardy&quot; games I&#39;d been used to.We were not playing in L.A. on the regular &quot;Jeopardy&quot; set.Watson does not travel.Watson&#39;s actually huge.It&#39;s thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory,trillions of bytes of memory.We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.The only other &quot;Jeopardy&quot; contestant to this day I&#39;ve ever been inside.And so Watson does not travel.You must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage.
时间： 6:24
zh-cn:所以我和其他人类玩家集聚在这个秘密的 IBM 研究实验室在威彻斯特县的雪域森林中和电脑玩‘危险’游戏。我们马上意识到沃森有巨大的主场优势在舞台中央，有一个大的沃森徽标。就好像你要和芝加哥公牛队比赛，在他们的球场，会有一个公牛队的标志。观众席上，坐满了 IBM 副总裁和程序员给他们的小宝贝加油，在投入数以百万计的美元后他们希望人类输他们高举&quot;沃森加油&quot;的标语,就像选美妈妈一样，每次他们亲爱的小闺女答对一个问题，他们就鼓掌。我看到男员工们用油脂漆在他们的肚子上写上&quot;W-A-T-S-O-N（沃森）&quot;的名字。想象一下，计算机程序员将&quot;W-A-T-S-O-N（沃森）&quot;写在肚皮上，怪恶心的。
en:So me and the other human playerwound up at this secret IBM research labin the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester Countyto play the computer.And we realized right awaythat the computer had a big home court advantage.There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.Like you&#39;re going to play the Chicago Bulls,and there&#39;s the thing in the middle of their court.And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmerscheering on their little darling,having poured millions of dollars into thishoping against hope that the humans screw up,and holding up &quot;Go Watson&quot; signsand just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right.I think guys had &quot;W-A-T-S-O-N&quot; written on their bellies in grease paint.If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters &quot;W-A-T-S-O-N&quot; written on their gut,it&#39;s an unpleasant sight.
时间： 7:15
zh-cn:但，他们对了。他们完全正确。如果你还没看过这次比赛的录像，我不想扫兴，但沃森赢得轻而易举。我记得站在舞台的后面当我听到那小昆虫机器人敲击蜂音器。机器人有一个拇指，可以敲击蜂鸣器。你能听到嘀嗒、 嘀嗒、 嘀嗒、 嘀嗒。我记得当时在想，完了。我过时了。我觉得自己像个八十年代底特律工厂的工人眼睁睁看着生产线上的机器人代替他工作。我觉得，在当下，知识测验节目参赛者也已经，被这个具有思维能力的计算机淘汰了。这样的事还会再重演。
en:But they were right. They were exactly right.I don&#39;t want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR,but Watson won handily.And I remember standing there behind the podiumas I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking.It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.And you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick.And I remember thinking, this is it.I felt obsolete.I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the &#39;80sseeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsoleteunder this new regime of thinking computers.And it hasn&#39;t been the last.

zh-cn:如果你看新闻，偶尔，你会看到— —我是经常看到这样的新闻的 — —比如药剂师，现在有一种机器，可以自动按处方配药不需要药剂师的干预。很多的律师事务所律师解雇专职助手因为软件可以总结案件、法律摘要和决定。他们不再需要人类助理了。前几天，我读到一篇关于程序的报道，如果你给它输入足球手或棒球员的个人成绩表，它就能吐出一篇新闻文章，就好像它真看过比赛然后像人一样的点评那场比赛。很明显，这些新技术与被取代的人类比起来它们不能做创造性的工作，也没有人类聪明但它们速度更快，至关重要的是，它们非常、非常便宜。所以，这使得我很好奇:这些技术的究竟如何影响经济。我听经济学家说过，这些新的技术，会给我们带来一个新的休闲黄金时代，我们都有时间来做我们真正感兴趣的事情因为这些麻烦的任务都将由像沃森一样的计算机来接管。其他人的意见正好相反，正是一帮中产阶层他们能做的事正被新的技术夺走这是很不幸的，我们应该为此担忧。
en:If you watch the news, you&#39;ll see occasionally —and I see this all the time —that pharmacists now, there&#39;s a machine that can fill prescriptions automaticallywithout actually needing a human pharmacist.And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegalsbecause there&#39;s software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.You don&#39;t need human assistants for that anymore.I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box scorefrom a baseball or football gameand it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the gameand was commenting on it.And obviously these new technologies can&#39;t do as clever or creative a jobas the humans they&#39;re replacing,but they&#39;re faster, and crucially, they&#39;re much, much cheaper.So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.I&#39;ve read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies,we&#39;ll enter a new golden age of leisurewhen we&#39;ll all have time for the things we really lovebecause all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.I&#39;ve heard other people say quite the opposite,that this is yet another tier of the middle classthat&#39;s having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technologyand that this is actually something ominous,something that we should worry about.

zh-cn:我本人不是经济学家。但我知道，失去工作的感受。那是沉重的精神打击，十分可怕。玩‘危险’是我最擅长的，但是， 如果 IBM 注入数以千万计的美元， 雇用其最聪明的人，使用成千上万的处理器，那么，他们就可以将我取而代之。‘沃森’可以在全国电视上做得更快一点、更 好一点，IBM就会对我说，&quot;很抱歉，肯，我们不需要你了“。我开始思考，如果我们开始外包、不仅仅只是低级的思维功能这意味着什么。我肯定你们很多人还记得，很久以前，我们必须记忆电话号码，在脑子里记住朋友们的电话号码。突然间，发明了一种机器， 代我们记忆电话号码，现在，我们不需要再记得这些了。我读到证据证明 使用导向工具（如 GPS）的人，他们的海马体-处理空间关系的那一部分大脑组织，会萎缩退化。使用工具如GPS的人因为我们不再使用我们的方向感，而只是，被动的服从那个会说话的仪器指挥。结果，负责方向感的大脑组织缩小、变笨。我在想，如果我们完全依赖计算机来记忆和思维，那将是怎样的情景？整个大脑都会萎缩退化吗？我们的文化会看轻知识的价值吗？这种可能的趋势令人恐惧，因为我一直重视知识的力量。
en:I&#39;m not an economist myself.All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.And it was friggin&#39; demoralizing. It was terrible.Here&#39;s the one thing that I was ever good at,and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest peopleand thousands of processors working in paralleland they could do the same thing.They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV,and &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ken. We don&#39;t need you anymore.&quot;And it made me think, what does this mean,if we&#39;re going to be able to start outsourcing,not just lower unimportant brain functions.I&#39;m sure many of you remember a distant timewhen we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends&#39; phone numbers.And suddenly there was a machine that did that,and now we don&#39;t need to remember that anymore.I have read that there&#39;s now actually evidencethat the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships,physically shrinks and atrophiesin people who use tools like GPS,because we&#39;re not exercising our sense of direction anymore.We&#39;re just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard.And as a result, a part of our brain that&#39;s supposed to do that kind of stuffgets smaller and dumber.And it made me think, what happens when computers are now betterat knowing and remembering stuff than we are?Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know,this was a terrifying idea to me.

zh-cn:我越是深思熟虑，越是意识到， 不！知识仍然很重要。我们的知识，仍然很重要。我相信， 比起那些只会说“噢，等等。我用谷歌搜一下&quot; 的人，脑子里有知识的人，至少有两个优点。一个是信息量的优势，一个是时间的优势。
en:The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it&#39;s still important.The things we know are still important.I came to believe there were two advantagesthat those of us who have these things in our head haveover somebody who says, &quot;Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second.&quot;There&#39;s an advantage of volume, and there&#39;s an advantage of time.
时间：11:00
zh-cn:首先是信息量的优势。现今的世界十分复杂，因而信息量也大。我们不能和文艺复兴时代的男女相比，那是一个特殊的时代，不可再现。在当今的时代，实在是不可能掌握所有领域的知识。那太强人所难了。据说，人类信息的范围，人类信息的总和，差不多每 18 个月翻一倍。这意味着，如用千兆字节来计算，从现在到 2014年底所生成的信息量，将等同于人类所有之前产生的信息量的总和。而且，人类的总信息量，每隔18个月增加一倍。这是很可怕的， 因为很多重大决定的抉择，需要掌握的很多不同种类的資訊。比如，我去哪所学校上学？我应该主修哪个方向？我投票给哪个候选人？我选择这份或那份工作？我们需要了解多种大量的資訊，才能做出正确的判断。如果我们的大脑里有这些知识，我们就能够作出精明的決定。另一方面，假如，我们需要查看搜寻这些信息，我们可能会有麻烦。国家地理最近的一项调查显示在美国总统选举中，以外交政策为主要考量的投票人中，大约80%的人，不能在地图上指出伊拉克或阿富汗。如果你连这点常识都没有，你真的会去查询几千条其它信息，来充实美国外交政策方面的知识吗？我想，你是不会的。有一天，你会说，&quot;算了吧！太多了，去它的吧！&quot;。你会做出不明智的决定。
en:The advantage of volume, first,just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.There&#39;s so much information out there.Being a Renaissance man or woman,that&#39;s something that was only possible in the Renaissance.Now it&#39;s really not possibleto be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.There&#39;s just too much.They say that the scope of human informationis now doubling every 18 months or so,the sum total of human information.That means between now and late 2014,we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes,as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.It&#39;s doubling every 18 months now.This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we makerequire the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.A decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in?Who do I vote for?Do I take this job or that one?These are the decisions that require correct judgmentsabout many different kinds of facts.If we have those facts at our mental fingertips,we&#39;re going to be able to make informed decisions.If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up,we may be in trouble.According to a National Geographic survey I just saw,somewhere along the lines of 80 percentof the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policycannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map.If you can&#39;t do that first step,are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you&#39;re going to need to knowto master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy?Quite probably not.At some point you&#39;re just going to be like,&quot;You know what? There&#39;s too much to know. Screw it.&quot;And you&#39;ll make a less informed decision.

zh-cn:另外，如果你对这些事情廖若指掌，你就有时间的优势。我常想到，一个叫蒂莉史密斯的小女孩的故事。她来自英国萨里郡，10 岁，几年前，她与父母去泰国普吉岛度假。一个早晨，在海滩上，她跑向父母，并说，&quot;妈妈，爸爸，我们得离开海滩.&quot;他们说，&quot;什么意思？我们刚刚到这里&quot;。她说，&quot;上个月，在地理课上，卡尼先生提过，如果有不正常的退潮，而且波涛剧烈翻腾，这是海啸的标志，应该尽快离开海滩。如果你10 岁的女儿跟你说这个，你会怎样？她的父母想了想，最后，她的父母决定相信她，他们真不错。他们告知了救生员，并回到了酒店，幸运的是，救生员将海滩上的 100 多人清场，那天就发生了节礼日海啸。2004年圣诞节后的第一天，东南亚和印度洋周边，成千上万的人遇难。但迈考海滩幸免，因为这个小女孩，想起了一个月前从地理老师那里学来的知识，
en:The other issue is the advantage of time that you haveif you have all these things at your fingertips.I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.She was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, Englandon vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand.She runs up to them on the beach one morningand says, &quot;Mom, Dad, we&#39;ve got to get off the beach.&quot;And they say, &quot;What do you mean? We just got here.&quot;And she said, &quot;In Mr. Kearney&#39;s geography class last month,he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to seaand you see the waves churning way out there,that&#39;s the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach.&quot;What would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this?Her parents thought about it,and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel,and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily,because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami,the day after Christmas, 2004,that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach,because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.

zh-cn:当知识派上用场的时候—我喜欢这个故事，因为它显示了知识的力量，活学活用，恰当其时，通常在游戏节目上比在现实生活中更容易看到这样的例子。但在这个故事里，它发生在现实生活中。这样的例子在现实生活中时常发生。它并不总是一场海啸，通常是社交场合。可能是一个会议、工作面试或第一次约会，两人意识到他们分享一些共同的信息，人际关系因而开始升温。你说你从哪儿来，或你的母校，或你的工作，我说，&quot;噢，是的&quot;。可能我知道只是些支离破碎的信息，当这足够让我们的谈话进行下去。当对方知道一点儿关于你的情况，你更容易和他建立关系。就好像你们还未见过面他就花了时间先认识你这往往是时间的优势。依靠计算机就不会有这种效果。假如你说，“好，等一等，你来自北达科塔州的法戈，让我查查有什么相关资讯。哦，是的。罗杰 • 马里斯也来自法戈。&quot;这不起作用，只能令人生厌。（笑声）
en:Now when facts come in handy like that —I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact,one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time —normally something that&#39;s easier to see on game shows than in real life.But in this case it happened in real life.And it happens in real life all the time.It&#39;s not always a tsunami, often it&#39;s a social situation.It&#39;s a meeting or job interview or first dateor some relationship that gets lubricatedbecause two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.You say where you&#39;re from, and I say, &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot;Or your alma mater or your job,and I know just a little something about it,enough to get the ball rolling.People love that shared connection that gets createdwhen somebody knows something about you.It&#39;s like they took the time to get to know you before you even met.That&#39;s often the advantage of time.And it&#39;s not effective if you say, &quot;Well, hold on.You&#39;re from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up.Oh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo.&quot;That doesn&#39;t work. That&#39;s just annoying.(Laughter)

zh-cn:伟大的18世纪英国神学家和思想家，也是约翰逊博士的朋友塞缪尔 · 帕尔曾经说过，&quot;知道一件事总比不知道强&quot;。如果我有任何生活信条的话，就应该是这个。我一直相信我们所知道的知识 — — 知识绝对是好事，我们已经学到的知识，记忆在我们的头脑里的知识，造就我们个人，这是人类之所以为万物之灵。我不知道我是否想要生活在一个知识没有价值的世界。我不想生活在一个文化素养被专精知识所取代的的世界，一个没有共享的知识的世界，没有那些将人类联系在一起的文明。我不想成为最后的‘百事通’独坐在一座山上的某处，背诵州首府城市名和&quot;辛普森一家&quot;的电视剧情节，或是Abba曲的歌词。我觉得要延续我们的文明，分享丰富的文化遗产，只能依赖我们的智力，而不是依靠计算机、搜索引擎和智能手机。
en:The great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson,Samuel Parr once said, &quot;It&#39;s always better to know a thing than not to know it.&quot;And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, it&#39;s probably that.I have always believed that the things we know — that knowledge is an absolute good,that the things we have learned and carry with us in our headsare what make us who we are,as individuals and as a species.I don&#39;t know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.I don&#39;t want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replacedby these little bubbles of specialty,so that none of us know about the common associationsthat used to bind our civilization together.I don&#39;t want to be the last trivia know-it-allsitting on a mountain somewhere,reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodesand the lyrics of Abba songs.I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all shareand that we know without having to outsource it to our devices,to our search engines and our smartphones.

zh-cn:在电影中，当像沃森一样的计算机开始思考时，事情总是没有好下场。这些电影总是讲恐怖故事，要么是终结者、要么是黑客帝国、要么就是电影“2001”，宇航员被卡在闸门里 。总之事情总会变得非常糟糕。我感觉现在的情形和这差不多。我们需要做出选择，我们想要什么样的未来。这是一个关于领导的问题因为问题就是让谁来领导我们的未来一方面，我们可以选择一个新的黄金时代信息随处可取，前所未有的便利，所有问题的答案都在我们的指掌。另一方面，我们也有可能造就一个黑暗又混论的社会机器主宰我们，我们已经决定了解知识已经不重要知识没有价值，因为都可在网络上查询，我们没有必要学习任何新的东西。
en:In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think,things don&#39;t always end well.Those movies are never about beautiful utopias.It&#39;s always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in &quot;2001.&quot;Things always go terribly wrong.And I feel like we&#39;re sort of at the point nowwhere we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in.This is a question of leadership,because it becomes a question of who leads the future.On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden agewhere information is more universally availablethan it&#39;s ever been in human history,where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.And on the other hand,we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopiawhere the machines have taken overand we&#39;ve all decided it&#39;s not important what we know anymore,that knowledge isn&#39;t valuable because it&#39;s all out there in the cloud,and why would we ever bother learning anything new.

zh-cn:这是我们的两个选择。我知道我宁愿生活在哪一种未来。我们都可以做这个选择好奇心强、好学的人们所选择的就是这种未来，他们不会说，&quot;哈，下课铃一响，课堂结束，我就不需要再学习了，&quot;或者说 &quot;谢天谢地终于拿到毕业证。我这辈子学够了。我不需要再学习新的东西了&quot;。不，我们每一天都应当努力学习新的知识。对于这个的世界，我们应该抱有无尽的好奇心。‘危险’参赛选手都有这种特征。这些‘百事通’，他们不是像电影‘雨人’里面的学者一样，坐在家里，死背电话簿。我见过很多选手。在很多方面，他们和普通人没有不同，但他们普遍兴趣广泛，好奇心强，求知欲强。
en:Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in.And we can all make that choice.We make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn,who don&#39;t just say, &quot;Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over,I don&#39;t have to learn anymore,&quot;or &quot;Thank goodness I have my diploma. I&#39;m done learning for a lifetime.I don&#39;t have to learn new things anymore.&quot;No, every day we should be striving to learn something new.We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.That&#39;s where the people you see on &quot;Jeopardy&quot; come from.These know-it-alls, they&#39;re not Rainman-style savantssitting at home memorizing the phone book.I&#39;ve met a lot of them.For the most part, they are just normal folkswho are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything,thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject.

zh-cn:我们有这两个世界可以选择。一个，我们的大脑，我们的知识，使我们有别其他物种，另一个，我们可以完全依赖邪恶的超级计算机，像沃森。女士们先生们，选择是你的。
en:We can live in one of these two worlds.We can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know,continue to be the thing that makes us special,or a world in which we&#39;ve outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.Ladies and gentlemen, the choice is yours.
