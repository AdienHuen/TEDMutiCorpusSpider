zh-cn:今天我要谈的话题，我称之为“网”我们和生活中事物间的关系发生了根本变化这种变化体现在-——虽不能一概而论——但有时对于一些特定的产品和服务，我们只需拥有使用权并不需要占用它们这样的话，更好的东西就可以更容易的被分享我们很早就学会分享分享交通分享红酒与食物还有阿姆斯特丹咖啡厅里的美妙经历我们分享其它娱乐方式体育馆、公园音乐厅、图书馆大学这些都是分享平台但分享最终是跟我称为“分享平台之母”的东西密切相关的
en:I&#39;m speaking to you about what I call the &quot;mesh.&quot;It&#39;s essentially a fundamental shiftin our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.And it&#39;s starting to look at —not always and not for everything —but in certain moments of time,access to certain kinds of goods and servicewill trump ownership of them.And so it&#39;s the pursuit of better things,easily shared.And we come from a long tradition of sharing.We&#39;ve shared transportation.We&#39;ve shared wine and foodand other sorts of fabulous experiencesin coffee bars in Amsterdam.We&#39;ve also shared other sorts of entertainment —sports arenas, public parks,concert halls, libraries,universities.All these things are share-platforms,but sharing ultimately starts and endswith what I refer toas the &quot;mother of all share-platforms.&quot;

zh-cn:一说到“网”我就想到，它的驱动因素是什么为何发生在现在我想先给你们讲讲几点要素作为背景介绍第一，经济衰退它让我们重新审视我们日常生活中的事物与其价值的关系试图追求物有所值第二，人口增长和城市密度增加人数不断增加，空间不断减少物品也在减少气候变化我们试图为我们的个人生活、社会和地球减压此外，还包括最近对各行各业知名品牌，全球知名品牌的不信任故事就这样拉开了序幕研究表明，在美国加拿大和西欧大多数人更愿意接受本土公司或闻所未闻的品牌但以前，我们只选择我们百分百相信的大品牌最后一点我们开始跟这个地球上更多的人产生以前根本不可能的联系当然除了坐在你旁边的人
en:And as I think about the meshand I think about, well, what&#39;s driving it,how come it&#39;s happening now,I think there&#39;s a number of vectorsthat I want to give you as background.One is the recession —that the recession has caused usto rethink our relationshipwith the things in our lives relative to the value —so starting to align the valuewith the true cost.Secondly, population growthand density into cities.More people, smaller spaces,less stuff.Climate change:we&#39;re trying to reduce the stressin our personal lives and in our communitiesand on the planet.Also, there&#39;s been this recent distrustof big brands, global big brands,in a bunch of different industries,and that&#39;s created an opening.Research is showing here, in the States,and in Canada and Western Europe,that most of us are much more opento local companies,or brands that maybe we haven&#39;t heard of.Whereas before, we went with the big brandsthat we were sure we trusted.And last is thatwe&#39;re more connected now to more people on the planetthan ever before —except for if you&#39;re sitting next to someone.

zh-cn:还有一点值得我们注意过去几十年来我们投入大量金钱几十亿美元的巨额投资如今为我们带来巨大利益它就是实体基建它允许我们实现人和物在A、B两点间的转移还有网络和手机连接彼此创建各种平台和系统在这些科技和基建上的投入让我们获益良多我们得以用新奇有趣的方式沟通
en:The other thing that&#39;s worth consideringis that we&#39;ve made a huge investmentover decades and decades,and tens of billions of dollarshave gone into this investmentthat now is our inheritance.It&#39;s a physical infrastructurethat allows us to get from point A to point Band move things that way.It&#39;s also — Web and mobileallow us to be connectedand create all kinds of platforms and systems,and the investment of those technologiesand that infrastructureis really our inheritance.It allows us to engagein really new and interesting ways.

zh-cn:对我而言，网状公司，传统网状公司实现了以下3点：人们彼此间的连接很多人和这些移动设备形影不离它们有全球定位系统和上网功能能让我们随时随地联系他人、获取信息第三，你既能在地图上找到实物比如餐厅，还有其它场所而且能用GPS和其它科技比如无线射频识别技术进行定位而且新技术还在层出不穷我们能追踪移动中的物体如汽车、出租车、运输系统不受时空限制它允许我们不用购买所有产品和服务也能以更方便和廉价的方式使用它们
en:And so for me, a mesh company, the &quot;classic&quot; mesh company,brings together these three things:our ability to connect to each other —most of us are walking around with these mobile devicesthat are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled —allows us to find each otherand find things in time and space.And third is that physical thingsare readable on a map —so restaurants, a variety of venues,but also with GPS and other technologylike RFIDand it continues to expand beyond that,we can also track things that are moving,like a car, a taxicab, a transit system,a box that&#39;s moving through time and space.And so that sets upfor making access to get goods and servicesmore convenient and less costly in many casesthan owning them.

zh-cn:例如，我想光顾Zipcar（美国汽车租赁商）你们谁试过和别人共享汽车或自行车？很多人。好，谢谢Zipcar其实是全球最大的汽车共享公司但汽车共享并非他们发明它最先起源于欧洲其中一位创始人后来去了瑞士看到它在某些地方的流行后说：“看起来很棒或许我们能在剑桥试试。”于是把这个理念带到了剑桥她们，两位女性，建立了这间公司罗彬·切斯是另一位创始人Zipcar有几点做得很好第一，他们清楚认识到品牌是灵魂，而产品只是躯壳他们把汽车租赁这个理念包装得狠聪明他们添加了性感和新鲜的元素让人们渴望拥有它若你是会员当你成为了会员，你就是其中一份子他们选择的汽车不是过时警车让人感觉空洞沉闷他们选择性感火辣的车款选择大学生作为目标市场他们确保了汽车与目标市场特征相符创造了美妙的体验汽车干净、可靠，性能良好
en:For example, I want to use Zipcar.How many people here have experiencedcar-sharing or bike-sharing?Wow, that&#39;s great. Okay, thank you.Basically Zipcaris the largest car-sharing company in the world.They did not invent car-sharing.Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.One of the founders went to Switzerland,saw it implemented someplace,said, &quot;Wow, that looks really cool.I think we can do that in Cambridge,&quot;brought it to Cambridgeand they started — two women —Robin Chase being the other person who started it.Zipcar got some really important things right.First, they really understoodthat a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.And so they were very cleverabout the way that they packaged car-sharing.They made it sexy. They made it fresh.They made it aspirational.If you were a member of the club,when you&#39;re a member of a club, you&#39;re a Zipster.The cars they picked didn&#39;t look like ex-cop carsthat were hollowed out or something.They picked these sexy cars.They targeted to universities.They made sure that the demographicfor who they were targeting and the car was all matching.It was a very nice experience,and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.

zh-cn:他们把品牌打造得很出色但他们同时清楚了解到他们不是汽车公司他们知道自己只是信息公司因为如果我们是买车我们进厂、交易、付款一切都很快完事但若你提供汽车共享服务你可能选择雷诺作为日常交通工具若你要搬家，就可能选择卡车若你要去机车接你阿姨，你选择小轿车若你要去山上滑雪你要把各种所需器材放到车上同时，公司暗地里收集所有关于消费者行为和需求的数据这由不得他们选择我认为Zipcar和其它网状公司不得不给我们制造惊喜提供贴心服务因为我们给他们提供了大量信息他们能真正看到我们如何移动他们很擅长去猜测我们的潜在需求
en:And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.But they understood fundamentallythat they are not a car company.They understand that they are an information company.Because when we buy a carwe go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we&#39;re chow —usually as quickly as possible.But when you&#39;re sharing a car and you have a car-share service,you might use an E.V. to commute,you get a truck because you&#39;re doing a home project.When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.And you&#39;re going to the mountains to ski,you get different accessories put on the carfor doing that sort of thing.Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back,collecting all sorts of dataabout our behavior and how we interact with the service.And so it&#39;s not only an option for them,but I believe it&#39;s an imperativefor Zipcar and other mesh companiesto actually just wow us,to be like a concierge service.Because we give them so much information,and they are entitled to really seehow it is that we&#39;re moving.They&#39;re in really good shape to anticipatewhat we&#39;re going to want next.

zh-cn:你认为一个人一天中用车的时间有多长？占多大比例？你们猜？很好一开始我猜大概20%美国和西欧是8%就当做是10%好了剩下90%的时间这个敲了我们一大笔钱的物品——对个人而言，同时对我们的城市也有重大影响还有所有事物90%的时间，它被闲置一旁因此我认为网状的另一个重点其实是，若我们好好利用被抛弃的物品它们仍有极大利用价值Zipcar如何诞生，Zipcar在2000年成立
en:And so what percent of the daydo you think the average person uses a car?What percentage of the time?Any guesses?Those are really very good.I was imagining it was like20 percent when I first started.The number across the U.S. and Western Europeis eight percent.And so basically even if you think it&#39;s 10 percent,90 percent of the time,something that costs us a lot of money —personally, and also we organize our cities around itand all sorts of things —90 percent of the time it&#39;s sitting around.So for this reason,I think one of the other themes with the meshis essentially that, if we squeeze hardon things that we&#39;ve thrown away,there&#39;s a lot of value in those things.What set up with Zipcar — Zipcar started in 2000.

zh-cn:去年，2010年两间汽车公司成立一间在英国，叫Whipcar另一间在美国，叫Relayrides他们都是点对点汽车租赁公司汽车租赁成功的两点关键是一，必须有车二，必须离你近大概只有一两个街区的距离吧而离你家或公司很近的很可能是你邻居的车闲置的可能性也大于是这种交易方式诞生了Zipcar在十年前，2000年成立他们花了六年时间为公司找到1000辆车子而在去年四月成立的Whipcar花了六个月就找来了1000辆汽车很有意思人们在自己不用车时把车租给邻居每月能有200-700美元的额外收入把度假别墅租赁的概念用到汽车上今天我在这里的原因我希望在坐的也有从事汽车行业的人（笑声）我在想，从科技的角度来说我们有有线电视配备无线上网的笔记本电脑若某一天你们能开间汽车公司能随时提供租赁服务，那就太棒了这给人们带来极大的便利同时也为车主提供了其他选择我认为这总有一天会实现
en:In the last year, 2010,two car companies started,one that&#39;s in the U.K. called WhipCar,and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.They&#39;re both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,because the two things that really work for car-sharingis, one, the car has to be available,and two, it&#39;s within one or two blocksof where you stand.Well the car that&#39;s one or two blocks from your home or your officeis probably your neighbor&#39;s car,and it&#39;s probably also available.So people have created this business.Zipcar started a decade earlier,in 2000.It took them six yearsto get 1,000 cars in service.WhipCar, which started April of last year,it took them six monthsto get 1,000 cars in the service.So, really interesting.People are making anywhere between200 and 700 dollars a monthletting their neighbors use their car when they&#39;re not using it.So it&#39;s like vacation rentals for cars.Since I&#39;m here —and I hope some people in the audienceare in the car business —(Laughter)— I&#39;m thinking that, coming from the technology side of things —we saw cable-ready TVsand WiFi-ready Notebooks —it would be really great if, any minute now,you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.Because it just creates more flexibility.It allows us as owners to have other options.And I think we&#39;re going there anyway.

zh-cn:网状交易的机遇和挑战——像Zipcar和Netflix这种完全依赖网状的公司或很多其它汽车公司汽车制造商开始提供自己的汽车租赁服务新生品牌也不例外或只是个测试，我认为——让共享服务拥有无法抗拒的魅力我们在生活中当然也体验到分享的魅力问题在于如何让它在一个大群体中实现？我们还知道，我们在社会网络中彼此连接很容易让事情有事半功倍的效果因为我们彼此连接，这种效果传播得更快如果我碰到一件很棒的事情我把它发布在Tweeter上，或我告诉身边的五个人，一传十十传百反之亦然有时候还更明显
en:The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses —and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflixthat are full mesh businesses,or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,car manufacturers,who are beginning to offertheir own car-share servicesas well as a second flanker brand,or as really a test, I think —is to make sharing irresistible.We have experiences in our lives, certainly,when sharing has been irresistible.It&#39;s just, how do we make that recurrentand scale it?We know also, because we&#39;re connected in social networks,that it&#39;s easy to create delightin one little place.It&#39;s contagious because we&#39;re all connected to each other.So if I have a terrific experienceand I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.The opposite, as we know, is also true,often more true.

zh-cn:洛杉矶有间LudoTruck和其它流动食品车类似他们引来了一大批追随者总而言之，或许因为我是技术型企业家我把它们看作平台平台向人们发出邀请Craigslist（大型免费分类广告网站）iTunes和iPhone开发商网络各种网络，还有Facebook这些平台吸引各种开发人员和其他各色人等分享他们的想法和机遇针对某个目标群体创建应用程序坦白说，惊喜连连我想在座各位没人会预料到Facebook及其相关各种应用程序的诞生吧例如，两年前当Mark宣布他们打算创建这样一个平台的时候
en:So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,doing the things that gourmet food trucks do,and they&#39;ve gathered quite a following.In general, and maybe, again, it&#39;s because I&#39;m a tech entrepreneur,I look at things as platforms.Platforms are invitations.So creating Craigslistor iTunes and the iPhone developer network,there are all these networks — Facebook as well.These platforms invite all sorts of developersand all sorts of peopleto come with their ideas and their opportunityto create and target an applicationfor a particular audience.And honestly, it&#39;s full of surprises.Because I don&#39;t think any of us in this roomcould have predicted the sorts of applicationsthat have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,for example, two years ago,when Mark announcedthat they were going to go with a platform.
时间： 9:59
zh-cn:同样，城市也是平台底特律当然也是个平台它们吸引制造商、艺术家和企业家激起源源不断的创造力让一个城市变得欣欣向荣它邀请人们参与到其中而城市自古以来邀请各种人的加入但同时也有其它可能性例如，城市部门能公开运输数据Google已经提供了运输数据的应用程序接口（API）美国已有七、八个城市提供传输数据开发人员也在开发各种应用程序有天我在波特兰喝咖啡才刚喝到一半咖啡厅里的告示板突然显示下一班公车将在3分钟后到达火车将在16分钟后到达我在咖啡厅里亲眼看到这个可靠、真实的数据所以我能及时喝完咖啡
en:So in this way, I think that cities are platforms,and certainly Detroit is a platform.The invitation of bringingmakers and artists and entrepreneurs —it really helps stimulate this fiery creativityand helps a city to thrive.It&#39;s inviting participation,and cities have, historically,invited all sorts of participation.Now we&#39;re saying that there&#39;s other options as well.So, for example, city departmentscan open up transit data.Google has made available transit data API.And so there&#39;s about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.that have provided the transit data,and different developers are building applications.So I was having a coffee in Portland,and half-of-a-latte inand the little board in the cafeall of a sudden starts showing methat the next bus is coming in three minutesand the train is coming in 16 minutes.And so it&#39;s reliable, real datathat&#39;s right in my face, where I am,so I can finish the latte.

zh-cn:如今我们在美国也能享受此般美妙待遇了商业和工业21%的闲置空间可有可无周边区域缺乏活力生机和人气还有一点——多少人听说过弹出式商店？很好。我很喜欢这种商店它的网状特点很明显在奥克兰我家附近有各种餐厅每三周就有一个弹出式商店出现他们为美食家举办一个很精彩的社交活动非常有趣，而且它发生在一个过渡性的社区环境后来在它持续了一年后他们开始出租、创造和延伸一个冷清的小区开始变得活力充沛人气很旺举个例子创意达人是个很喜欢工艺品的女性她在伦敦附近举办弹出式工艺品集市这些事情发生在很多迥然不同的环境中在我看来，弹出式商店的特点之一就是创造易逝性和紧急性它创造了所有商人最爱听的一个词售罄能聚集信任和关注是件很棒的事
en:There&#39;s this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:about 21 percentof vacant commercial and industrial space.That space is not vital.The areas around it lack vitalityand vibrancy and engagement.There&#39;s this thing — how many people herehave heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?Oh, great. So I&#39;m a big fan of this.And this is a very mesh-y thing.Essentially, there are all sortsof restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.There&#39;s a pop-up general store every three weeks,and they do a fantastic jobof making a very social eventhappening for foodies.Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.Subsequent to that,after it&#39;s been going for about a year now,they actually started to lease and create and extend.An area that was edgy-artsyis now starting to become much coolerand engage a lot more people.So this is an example.The Crafty Fox is this woman who&#39;s into crafts,and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.But these sorts of things are happeningin many different environments.From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores dois create perishability and urgency.It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:sold out.And the opportunity to really focus trust and attentionis a wonderful thing.

zh-cn:我们在这张网中所看到的在这个我们创建的平台中所拥有的允许我们将其定义、改进和规模化允许我们能像企业家那样测试事物进入市场与人们沟通聆听、改进和回归低投入、高产出网状特性很强其基础设施是前提条件
en:So a lot of what we see in the mesh,and a lot of what we have in the platform that we builtallows us to define, refine and scale.It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,to go to market,to be in conversation with people,listen, refine something and go back.It&#39;s very cost-effective,and it&#39;s very mesh-y.The infrastructure enables that.

zh-cn:今天的谈话即将结束，总而言之我想鼓励大家我也乐意分享我的失败经验但不是大庭广众之下（笑声）我只想强调一点当我们想节约想做到宽宏大量对社会有所贡献为创造更好的经济状况和环境而行动我们就要分享失败举个简单例子2007年，Velib（自行车出租服务商）来到巴黎提出一个大胆的建议提供大型自行车出租服务他们犯下很多错误同时也取得过巨大成功但他们公布了一切，或许不得已而为之他们告诉公众哪条路可行，哪条路不可行于是巴塞罗那的B.C.公司和B-cycle公司还有伦敦的Boris自行车出租公司没人重蹈它的覆辙不必再为在巴黎那样的失败教训付出昂贵的学费我们彼此连接的同时，也有机会分享成功与失败
en:In closing, and as we&#39;re moving towards the end,I just also want to encourage —and I&#39;m willing to share my failures as well,though not from the stage.(Laughter)I would just like to say that one of the big things,when we look at wasteand when we look at ways that we can really be generousand contribute to each other,but also move to create a better economic situationand a better environmental situation,is by sharing failures.And one quick exampleis Velib, in 2007,came forward in Pariswith a very bold proposition,a very big bike-sharing service.They made a lot of mistakes.They had some number of big successes.But they were very transparent, or they had to be,in the way that they exposedwhat worked and didn&#39;t work.And so B.C. in Barcelonaand B-cycleand Boris Bikes in London —no one has had to repeatthe version 1.0 screw-upsand expensive learning exercisesthat happened in Paris.So the opportunity when we&#39;re connectedis also to share failures and successes.

en:We&#39;re at the very beginning of somethingthat, what we&#39;re seeingand the way that mesh companies are coming forward,is inviting, it&#39;s engaging, but it&#39;s very early.I have a website — it&#39;s a directory —and it started with about 1,200 companies,and in the last two-and-a-half monthsit&#39;s up to about 3,300 companies.And it grows on a very regular daily basis.But it&#39;s very much at the beginning.
