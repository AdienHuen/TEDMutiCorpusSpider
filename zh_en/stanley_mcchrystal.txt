zh-cn:十年前，周二的早上我在北卡罗纳州的Fort Bragg讲述跳伞这是一次例行的跳伞练习 像我以往做过的很多的培训一样自从我成为专业的跳伞者后27年之前我们很早就来到飞机场因为在军队 你需要很早出行你做了一些例行的恢复训练接着你背上你的跳伞包 ,一个伙伴会帮你你背上T10的跳伞包你要很小心绑上安全皮带尤其是腿的皮带 因为你需要绑在你两腿之间接着穿上你的后备装置，接着背上你很重的帆布包接着跳伞专家也来了他是在跳伞操作方面很有经验的NCO他来跟你做检查，他拿着你调整安全皮带接着他绑紧所有东西所以你的胸部有些挤压感你肩膀也被压住当然，因为他绑得很紧 所以你的声音会提高几个八度接着你坐下来，等一段时间因为这是军队里接着要把你装到飞机里， 你站起来上飞机你在飞机中好像木头一样,人们排成了一列你坐在分列在飞机两旁的帆布座位上你要等候较长一段时间因为空军会告诉军队如何去等待
en:Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning,I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.It was a routine training jump, like many more I&#39;d donesince I became a paratrooper27 years before.We went down to the airfield earlybecause this is the Army and you always go early.You do some routine refresher training,and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.And you put on the T-10 parachute.And you&#39;re very careful how you put the straps,particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.And then a jumpmaster comes,and he&#39;s an experienced NCO in parachute operations.He checks you out, he grabs your adjusting strapsand he tightens everythingso that your chest is crushed,your shoulders are crushed down,and, of course, he&#39;s tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.Then you sit down, and you wait a little while,because this is the Army.Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on,and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people,and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.And you wait a little bit longer,because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.

zh-cn:接着你就起飞了这已经足够痛苦了我想就是这样设计的这非常痛苦 你很想跳下去你不是真的想跳下去 你只是想离开所以当你进入到飞机 你需要一直飞行接着20分钟过后 这些跳伞专家就会给你命令他们给你20分钟——这是时间的提醒你做在那里， 好的接着他们给你10分钟的提醒当然， 你要对这些做出回答这是为了建立每一个人的信心，告诉你不要害怕他们给你提示，“准备好了。”接着他们说，“外舱的人员，请站起来。”如果你是外舱的人员，你就要站起来。如果你是内舱的人员，站起来。你要用钩挂住，你钩在固定的拉线上。在那一刻，你想：“接下来会发生什么事情了？”我很可能准备跳下去。但在这一刻你绝对不能这样就跳出去。“你需要做额外的一些检查，接着他们打开舱门。
en:Then you take off.And it&#39;s painful enough now —and I think it&#39;s designed this way —it&#39;s painful enough so you want to jump.You didn&#39;t really want to jump, but you want out.So you get in the aircraft, you&#39;re flying along,and at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands.They give 20 minutes — that&#39;s a time warning.You sit there, OK.Then they give you 10 minutes.And of course, you&#39;re responding with all of these.And that&#39;s to boost everybody&#39;s confidence, to show that you&#39;re not scared.Then they give you, &quot;Get ready.&quot;Then they go, &quot;Outboard personnel, stand up.&quot;If you&#39;re an outboard personnel, now you stand up.If you&#39;re an inboard personnel, stand up.And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.And at that point, you think, &quot;Hey, guess what?I&#39;m probably going to jump.There&#39;s no way to get out of this at this point.&quot;You go through some additional checks, and then they open the door.

zh-cn:这就是九月里那个周二的早上外面都非常好新鲜的空气吹进来跳伞专家开始检查舱门到了起跳的时候会出现一道绿光 接着跳伞专家会喊，”开始。“第一个人跳下去了，你只需排着队。你就像木头一样靠在门边跳是一个不恰当的名字，确实来说你是掉下去你从舱门掉下去你被气流接住你第一个件事是锁定一个固定的身体姿势你的胸部朝下，你的手臂展开放在你预先准备的伞包你做这样的事，是因为在27年前一个空军警官让我这样做我并不知道这样是否会产生什么不同但他却使得这个很有道理我并不想做实验去证明他的假设是错的接着你等待着开伞那一刻那强劲的冲击如果你没有碰到这个冲击力，你可能没有带降落伞或者你遇上了一连串新的问题但通常伞都会正常打开当然，如果你的腿的皮带扣得不对此时你又会又是一阵紧张很大一声
en:And this was that Tuesday morning in September,and it was pretty nice outside.So nice air comes flowing in.The jumpmasters start to check the door.And then when it&#39;s time to go,a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, &quot;Go.&quot;The first guy goes, and you&#39;re just in line,and you just kind of lumber to the door.Jump is a misnomer; you fall.You fall outside the door,you&#39;re caught in the slipstream.The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position —head down in your chest, your arms extended,put over your reserve parachute.You do that because, 27 years before,an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.I have no idea whether it makes any difference,but he seemed to make sense,and I wasn&#39;t going to test the hypothesis that he&#39;d be wrong.And then you wait for the opening shockfor your parachute to open.If you don&#39;t get an opening shock, you don&#39;t get a parachute —you&#39;ve got a whole new problem set.But typically you do; typically it opens.And of course, if your leg straps aren&#39;t set right,at that point you get another little thrill.Boom.

zh-cn:接着你四处去看你所属的长官会说：“这不错。”现在 你要为不可避免的事情做准备你现在准备撞到地上你不能耽误太多实际上你不能决定哪里你撞得最厉害因为他们假想你可以驾控但事实上你是被送到地上的你四处去看，哪里是你着陆的地方你希望你自己能做好准备但当你越接近的时候，在下降的过程中你把你的背包置于你之下所以当你着陆时 它并不在身上你需要准备打开降落伞然后降落接着部队会教你五个部位的动作你的脚趾头你的小腿，你的大腿你的屁股和你的支撑肌肉这是一个优雅轻微的着陆，连翻代转者将不会造成伤害但在30年的跳伞经历中，我并没有成功作过（笑声）我总是像在3楼扔下的西瓜一样降落
en:So then you look around,you&#39;re under a canopy and you say, &quot;This is good.&quot;Now you prepare for the inevitable.You are going to hit the ground.You can&#39;t delay that much.And you really can&#39;t decide where you hit very much,because they pretend you can steer,but you&#39;re being delivered.So you look around, where you&#39;re going to land,you try to make yourself ready.And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line,so that it&#39;s not on you when you land,and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.Now the Army teaches youto do five points of performance —the toes of your feet,your calves, your thighs,your buttocks and your push-up muscles.It&#39;s this elegant little land, twist and roll.And that&#39;s not going to hurt.In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.(Laughter)I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.

zh-cn:只要我着地第一件事我会做的是看看我是否打烂了我的必需品我会晃脑袋问自己一个恒久的问题：“为什么我没有进入到银行业？”（笑声）我爱四处去看我喜欢看其他跳伞人员年轻男女他们需要拿出他们M-4的卡宾枪接着他们需要拿走他们的设备他们需要做所有的事情我们教授他们的我意识到如果他们需要战斗他们会作我们所有教他们的 他们会服从领导的安排我发现到，如果他们结束战争之后，会是怎样，因为我们领导得很好我再次被我做的事情的重要性迷住了
en:And as soon as I hit,the first thing I did is I&#39;d see if I&#39;d broken anything that I needed.I&#39;d shake my head,and I&#39;d ask myself the eternal question:&quot;Why didn&#39;t I go into banking?&quot;(Laughter)And I&#39;d look around,and then I&#39;d see another paratrooper,a young guy or girl,and they&#39;d have pulled out their M4 carbineand they&#39;d be picking up their equipment.They&#39;d be doing everythingthat we had taught them.And I realizedthat, if they had to go into combat,they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.And I realized that, if they came out of combat,it would be because we led them well.And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did.

zh-cn:所以在周二早上我跳的那一次但这不是任何一次跳伞——是在2001年九月11日当我们从机场起飞，美国当时还一片平静当我在预定着陆区域着陆，所有东西都改变了我们所想到的是很多年轻士兵进入到战争的可能性从理论上说这是非常非常真实的领导力显得很重要但是很多东西改变了我是46岁准将我曾经取得成功但很多事情已经改变我需要做出一些显著的改变在那一个早上，我并不知道
en:So now I do that Tuesday morning jump,but it&#39;s not any jump —that was September 11th, 2001.And when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace.When we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.And what we thoughtabout the possibility of those young soldiers going into combatas being theoreticalwas now very, very real —and leadership seemed important.But things had changed;I was a 46-year-old brigadier general.I&#39;d been successful,but things changed so muchthat I was going to have to make some significant changes,and on that morning, I didn&#39;t know it.

zh-cn:我在很多传统的关于领导力的故事所熏陶下成长Robert E.Lee, John Buford在葛斯底堡我同样受到了一些关于个人领导力的例子的熏陶这是我的父亲在越南我从小的培养就相信士兵是强壮和智慧的是勇敢和忠诚的他们不会说谎，欺骗和偷盗或者被战友所遗弃而我一直相信领导者就是这样的但在我职业生涯头25个年头中我获得了很多不同的经历
en:I was raised with traditional stories of leadership:Robert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg.And I also was raisedwith personal examples of leadership.This was my father in Vietnam.And I was raised to believethat soldiers were strong and wiseand brave and faithful;they didn&#39;t lie, cheat, stealor abandon their comrades.And I still believe real leaders are like that.But in my first 25 years of career,I had a bunch of different experiences.

zh-cn:我第一个战事中的一个指挥官我在他的营部工作了18个月他唯一和McChrystal中将的谈话是在25英里的行军中走到18英里的时候他严厉斥责我大约40秒我不肯定这是否一个真正意义上的互动但几年过去以后，当我是一个连队的指挥官时我去了全国训练中心我们布置了一个行动我的连队做了一个黎明攻击你知道，经典的黎明攻击你需要整晚准备，来到了出发的地方当时我拥有一个有装甲的团队我们按计划行动， 我们被全歼了我是说立刻被全歼了敌人没花摧毁之力在那次行动之后，他们带来了移动的电影院 做了“行动后的回顾”教你那些地方做错了所谓的屈辱教育他们带来一个大屏幕，让你重温一切“...你没有做这个，你也没有做这个，等等。”我走出来后感觉自己非常愚蠢而我看到我这个营部的指挥员，因为我让他失望了我走上去跟他道歉他说：&quot;Stanley，我觉得你做得很好。”这一句话，他的支持让我重新振作教会好领导者会让你尝试失败但不会让你变成败者。
en:One of my first battalion commanders,I worked in his battalion for 18 monthsand the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystalwas at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march,and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.And I&#39;m not sure that was real interaction.But then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander,I went out to the National Training Center.And we did an operation,and my company did a dawn attack —you know, the classic dawn attack:you prepare all night, move to the line of departure.And I had an armored organization at that point.We move forward, and we get wiped out —I mean, wiped out immediately.The enemy didn&#39;t break a sweat doing it.And after the battle,they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an &quot;after action review&quot;to teach you what you&#39;ve done wrong.Sort of leadership by humiliation.They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything:&quot;and then you didn&#39;t do this, and you didn&#39;t do this, etc.&quot;I walked out feeling as lowas a snake&#39;s belly in a wagon rut.And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.And I went up to apologize to him,and he said, &quot;Stanley, I thought you did great.&quot;And in one sentence,he lifted me, put me back on my feet,and taught me that leaders can let you failand yet not let you be a failure.

zh-cn:当911来临的时候，46岁的Brig.Gen.McChrystal看到一个全新的世界。首先，这些是很明显的，你熟悉的：环境改变了—速度，审议对所有事物的感触都很快有时变化得更加快没有时间给人们作出反应但所有我们做的事情都是在不同的情况下更加重要的是，我领导的军队已经遍布了20多个国家代替将所有的主要领导人为了一个决定集中在一个房间里面直视他们，建立他们信心，从他们那里得到信任，现在我领带一支分散的军队我需要使用其他技术。我需要用视频会议，我需要使用聊天工具，我需要用电邮，我需要用电话——我要用上所有我能用上的东西但这不仅仅是为了交流沟通这是为了领导。一个22岁的人一个人独立行动他离我数千里远需要有信心与我交流。我需要相信他们，反之亦然我需要建立他们的信心这是新型的领导能力对于我来说
en:When 9/11 came,46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world.First, the things that are obvious, that you&#39;re familiar with:the environment changed —the speed, the scrutiny,the sensitivity of everything now is so fast,sometimes it evolves fasterthan people have time to really reflect on it.But everything we dois in a different context.More importantly, the force that I ledwas spread over more than 20 countries.And instead of being able to get all the key leadersfor a decision together in a single roomand look them in the eye and build their confidenceand get trust from them,I&#39;m now leading a force that&#39;s dispersed,and I&#39;ve got to use other techniques.I&#39;ve got to use video teleconferences, I&#39;ve got to use chat,I&#39;ve got to use email, I&#39;ve got to use phone calls —I&#39;ve got to use everything I can,not just for communication,but for leadership.A 22-year-old individualoperating alone,thousands of miles from me,has got to communicate to me with confidence.I have to have trust in them and vice versa.And I also have to build their faith.And that&#39;s a new kind of leadershipfor me.

zh-cn:我们需要有一个运作系统我需要把多个地方联系起来一个紧急机会来了——没有时间让所有人集中在一起但我们需要集中智慧我们必须合力去采取行动。这是很敏感的，我们必须一路向上汇报说服他们这是我们应该做的事情完成这些东西在电子的媒介上我们失败了。这个任务没有能完成。所以我们现在需要做的我必须达到能重建（我带领的）军队的信任重建他们的信心我跟他们和他们跟我还有我们的上级和作为整个军队的我们所有的事情都不能单靠个人的力量全新的要求
en:We had one operationwhere we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.An emerging opportunity came —didn&#39;t have time to get everybody together.So we had to get complex intelligence together,we had to line up the ability to act.It was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command,convince them that this was the right thing to doand do all of thison electronic medium.We failed.The mission didn&#39;t work.And so now what we had to dois I had to reach outto try to rebuild the trust of that force,rebuild their confidence —me and them, and them and me,and our seniors and us as a force —all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder.Entirely new requirement.

zh-cn:当然人们也改变了你可能会想我带领的军队他们都是由钢铁般的眼神和巨大指节拳头的突击队员他们都带着奇异的武器事实上大部分我带领的军队看来都跟你们一样他们是男人，女人，年轻，年老的——并不是只来自于狭义上的军队,而是来自不同的组织他们很多人的信息都是来自一次握手的相遇不同于以往给出命令，你现在需要建立一致性你要建立一种以分享为目的的意识或者说最大的改变那是对于不同年代不同观念的理解时代改变了太多我下去跟突击部队的一个排参与了在阿富汗的一个行动在那一次行动中在这个排中一个警官损失了半个手臂他把塔利班扔到攻击部队里的一个手榴弹扔回了敌人阵营我们讲述了这次行动在最后我做了以往我跟军队做的事，就好像这样，我说，“在911的时候你们在哪里？”一个年轻的军士在后面他的头发打卷脸色通红那都是在阿富汗战斗中让寒风吹的他说&quot;长官,我在读六年级.&quot;这提醒我我们需要这样运行一支军队他们必须分享目的分享意识然而他有不同的经验在很多例子中 这是不同的词汇完全不同的一套技能用数码的媒体取代了我和其他高级领导者的做法我们现在需要一个有共享的意识
en:Also, the people had changed.You probably think that the force that I ledwas all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fistscarrying exotic weapons.In reality,much of the force I ledlooked exactly like you.It was men, women, young, old —not just from military; from different organizations,many of them detailed to us just from a handshake.And so instead of giving orders,you&#39;re now building consensusand you&#39;re building a sense of shared purpose.Probably the biggest changewas understanding that the generational difference,the ages, had changed so much.I went down to be with a Ranger platoonon an operation in Afghanistan,and on that operation,a sergeant in the platoonhad lost about half his armthrowing a Taliban hand grenadeback at the enemyafter it had landed in his fire team.We talked about the operation,and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that.I asked, &quot;Where were you on 9/11?&quot;And one young Ranger in the back —his hair&#39;s tousled and his face is red and windblownfrom being in combat in the cold Afghan wind —he said, &quot;Sir, I was in the sixth grade.&quot;And it reminded methat we&#39;re operating a forcethat must have shared purposeand shared consciousness,and yet he has different experiences,in many cases a different vocabulary,a completely different skill setin terms of digital mediathan I do and many of the other senior leaders.And yet, we need to have that shared sense.

zh-cn:它能制造一些东西我叫做倒置的专业技术因为我们在较低层次作了很多的改变在技术、战术诸如此类的东西突然之间我们在成长过程 中学会要做的事情现在部队已经不再做了作为一个领导者如何能保持合理性和信服力当他们在领导他人做那些他们自己也没有做过的事情的时候这是领导层遇到的崭新挑战它迫使我将很多事情变得透明要更乐意去聆听更乐意收到下层的反过来的指导而且，你们并不在一个屋子里这是另外一面会影响你和你们这些领导者这是有影响的，而且是累积的你不能重置，或者重新充电，你需要每时每刻充电
en:It also produced somethingwhich I call an inversion of expertise,because we had so many changes at the lower levelsin technology and tactics and whatnot,that suddenly the things that we grew up doingwasn&#39;t what the force was doing anymore.So how does a leaderstay credible and legitimatewhen they haven&#39;t donewhat the people you&#39;re leading are doing?And it&#39;s a brand new leadership challenge.And it forced me to become a lot more transparent,a lot more willing to listen,a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower.And yet, again, you&#39;re not all in one room.Then another thing.There&#39;s an effect on you and on your leaders.There&#39;s an impact, it&#39;s cumulative.You don&#39;t reset, or recharge your battery every time.

zh-cn:有一天晚上，我在伊朗站在一块屏幕前和一个比我高级的官员我们看到我们一支武装力量进行火力搏斗我记得他的儿子在我们的部队中我说：“John,你的儿子在哪里？现在怎么样？”他说，“他很好，多谢问候。”我说，“他在哪里？”他指着屏幕，说，“他就在这场火力搏斗中。”试想看着你的兄弟，父亲，女儿，儿子，妻子正在这场火力搏斗中你却不能帮他做任何事情想象一下随着时间的推移这种累积的压力沉沉压在领导者的身上
en:I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraqwith one of my senior officersand we watched a firefight from one of our forces.And I remembered his son was in our force.And I said, &quot;John, where&#39;s your son? And how is he?&quot;And he said, &quot;Sir, he&#39;s fine. Thanks for asking.&quot;I said, &quot;Where is he now?&quot;And he pointed at the screen, he said, &quot;He&#39;s in that firefight.&quot;Think about watching your brother, father,daughter, son, wifein a firefight in real timeand you can&#39;t do anything about it.Think about knowing that over time.And it&#39;s a new cumulative pressure on leaders.

zh-cn:但你必须照看和互相照顾。在怎样处理人的关系上我学到了很多我学习到他们是支柱他们让部队连在一起我的大部门职业生涯是在突击团队中成长的每一个早上 在这个团队中每一个军士， 两千个多个人诵读六段部队的信条你可能知道其中的一条，它是这样说的，“我绝对不会留下任何一个落后的队友在敌人的手中。”这不是一个愚蠢的咒语也不是一首诗这是一个承诺每一个军士都会向其他每一个军士作出承诺无论什么事情发生，无论对于自己付出什么代价如果你需要我，我就会来。每一个军士都获得这样的承诺从其他军士身上想象一下。这是绝对的有力量这甚至比结婚的誓言更加有力量他们为此而生存,并且给出了特别的力量所以有组织的关系把他们联系起来这是太棒了
en:And you have to watch and take care of each other.I probably learned the most about relationships.I learned they are the sinewwhich hold the force together.I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment.And every morning in the Ranger regiment,every Ranger — and there are more than 2,000 of them —says a six-stanza Ranger creed.You may know one line of it, it says,&quot;I&#39;ll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy.&quot;And it&#39;s not a mindless mantra,and it&#39;s not a poem.It&#39;s a promise.Every Ranger promises every other Ranger,&quot;No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me,if you need me, I&#39;m coming.&quot;And every Ranger gets that same promisefrom every other Ranger.Think about it. It&#39;s extraordinarily powerful.It&#39;s probably more powerful than marriage vows.And they&#39;ve lived up to it, which gives it special power.And so the organizational relationship that bonds themis just amazing.

zh-cn:我学习人际间的关系现在比以往都重要2007年我们在阿富汗的行动非常艰难我的一个老朋友我们交往了多年在我职业生涯多个重要的点上我还是他一个孩子的教父他给我寄了张纸条,就放在一个信封里是Sherman和Grant书信里的摘录说，“我知道如果我困住了，你是会来的，如果你还活着。”能有这样的关系 对于我而言在职业生涯的很多时候都至关重要
en:And I learned personal relationshipswere more important than ever.We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007,and an old friend of mine,that I had spent many yearsat various points of my career with —godfather to one of their kids —he sent me a note, just in an envelope,that had a quote from Sherman to Grantthat said, &quot;I knew if I ever got in a tight spot,that you would come, if alive.&quot;And having that kind of relationship, for me,turned out to be critical at many points in my career.

zh-cn:我学习到你必须付出在这样的环境里，因为这很艰难那是我的旅程我希望它还没有结束我开始相信一个领导并不是因为他正确了就是好的他们是好的，因为他们愿意学习和去信任别人这不是简单的事情这不是一个电子瘦肚机那里，一个月15分钟，帮你把肚子搓一下（笑声）这总不是那么的公平你可能被击败它会痛留下伤疤但如果你是一个领导者那些人你依赖的人会帮你成长如果你是一个领导者而那些信任你的人需要你立场坚定
en:And I learned that you have to give thatin this environment,because it&#39;s tough.That was my journey.I hope it&#39;s not over.I came to believethat a leader isn&#39;t good because they&#39;re right;they&#39;re good because they&#39;re willing to learn and to trust.This isn&#39;t easy stuff.It&#39;s not like that electronic abs machinewhere, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs.(Laughter)And it isn&#39;t always fair.You can get knocked down,and it hurtsand it leaves scars.But if you&#39;re a leader,the people you&#39;ve counted onwill help you up.And if you&#39;re a leader,the people who count on you need you on your feet.
