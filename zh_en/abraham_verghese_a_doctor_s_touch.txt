zh-cn:几个月前一个40岁的女士来到急诊室这个医院离我住的地方不远她被带来时神智不清血压处于警戒值收缩压230, 舒张压170几分钟内她就心血管虚脱了然后她被救醒，稳定下来带到靠着急诊室旁边的CAT扫描室因为医生担心她的肺部有血块CAT扫描仪显示肺部并没有血块但是两侧胸部有清晰可见的肿块是乳腺肿瘤并且已经转移到全身各部位但真正的悲剧是，如果你查看她的纪录会发现她已经在过去几年里辗转去过四五家医疗机构有四五次机会发现这些乳腺肿瘤，触碰到它们在早期就介入治疗而不是我们发现的时候
en:A few months ago,a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency roomin a hospital close to where I live,and she was brought in confused.Her blood pressure was an alarming230 over 170.Within a few minutes, she went into cardiac collapse.She was resuscitated, stabilized,whisked over to a CAT scan suiteright next to the emergency room,because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung.And the CAT scan revealedno blood clots in the lung,but it showed bilateral, visible, palpable breast masses,breast tumors,that had metastasized widelyall over the body.And the real tragedy was, if you look through her records,she had been seenin four or five other health care institutionsin the preceding two years.Four or five opportunitiesto see the breast masses, touch the breast mass,intervene at a much earlier stagethan when we saw her.

zh-cn:诸位这不是个不寻常的故事不幸的是，这样的事一直在发生我开个玩笑，不过只是半开玩笑如果你缺胳膊少腿去了医院没人会相信你丢了个肢体，除非你做了CAT扫描，磁共振成像还有骨科诊断我不是勒德分子我在斯坦福大学教书我是个掌握尖端技术的内科医生但我将在接下来的17分钟里想向你们讲述的是当我们缩短检查给病人开一堆检查单而不是与病人交流并检查时我们不仅忽视了处在早期可治疗阶段的简单诊断也失去了更重要的东西我们失去了一种仪式感一种我认为是具有影响力并且至高无上的仪式感这正是医患关系的核心在TED讲这个内容可能有点逆势而行但我想向各位介绍在未来十年的医学界最重要的发明这就是人类之手的力量－关怀，抚慰，诊断和治疗
en:Ladies and gentlemen,that is not an unusual story.Unfortunately, it happens all the time.I joke, but I only half joke,that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb,no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan, MRIor orthopedic consult.I am not a Luddite.I teach at Stanford.I&#39;m a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology.But I&#39;d like to make the case to youin the next 17 minutesthat when we shortcut the physical exam,when we lean towards ordering testsinstead of talking to and examining the patient,we not only overlook simple diagnosesthat can be diagnosed at a treatable, early stage,but we&#39;re losing much more than that.We&#39;re losing a ritual.We&#39;re losing a ritual that I believe is transformative, transcendent,and is at the heartof the patient-physician relationship.This may actually be heresy to say this at TED,but I&#39;d like to introduce youto the most important innovation,I think, in medicineto come in the next 10 years,and that is the power of the human hand —to touch, to comfort, to diagnoseand to bring about treatment.

zh-cn:首先我想介绍一个人你们不一定认得出他他是亚瑟·柯南·道尔爵士既然这是爱丁堡，我本人是柯南·道尔的粉丝也许有人听说过柯南·道尔是在爱丁堡上的医学院他创造的人物形象，福尔摩斯是受到约瑟夫･贝尔的启发约瑟夫･贝尔是个无可挑剔的杰出老师而柯南·道尔关于贝尔的著述描绘了贝尔和他的学生之间的交流
en:I&#39;d like to introduce you first to this personwhose image you may or may not recognize.This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.Since we&#39;re in Edinburgh, I&#39;m a big fan of Conan Doyle.You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical schoolhere in Edinburgh,and his character, Sherlock Holmes,was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell.Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts.And Conan Doyle, writing about Bell,described the following exchangebetween Bell and his students.
时间： 2:51
zh-cn:想像贝尔坐在门诊部他的学生围坐着病人在急诊室登记然后挂号，被带进来一个带小孩的女士进来了柯南･道尔这样写道女人说：早上好贝尔说：你从Burntisland坐渡船过来一路如何？她说：挺好贝尔说：你的另一个孩子怎么办了？她说，我拜托住在利斯的姐姐照顾了他说那你来诊所有没有从 Inverleith Row抄近路？她说没错贝尔道，那你还打算在油毡厂干活吗？她说是的
en:So picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department,students all around him,patients signing up in the emergency roomand being registered and being brought in.And a woman comes in with a child,and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange.The woman says, &quot;Good Morning.&quot;Bell says, &quot;What sort of crossing did you haveon the ferry from Burntisland?&quot;She says, &quot;It was good.&quot;And he says, &quot;What did you do with the other child?&quot;She says, &quot;I left him with my sister at Leith.&quot;And he says,&quot;And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Rowto get here to the infirmary?&quot;She says, &quot;I did.&quot;And he says, &quot;Would you still be working at the linoleum factory?&quot;And she says, &quot;I am.&quot;
时间： 3:38
zh-cn:然后贝尔向他的学生解释说当她说你好的时候我听出她的法夫口音而离法夫最近的渡船是在Burntisland所以我推测出她是从那里过来你也注意到她拿着的外套对跟她一起小孩子来说太小了所以她开始肯定带了两个孩子来了路上放下一个还有她鞋底上泥爱丁堡方圆百里内没有这种红泥除了植物园所以她肯定是从 Inverleith Row抄近路来这儿的最后，她右手手指有皮炎这种皮炎是只见于Burntisland的油毡厂工人然后贝尔就让她脱了衣服开始检查你无法想像他是多么仔细地察看作为一个医学老师，一个学生我深受这个故事启发
en:And Bell then goes on to explain to the students.He says, &quot;You see, when she said, &#39;Good morning,&#39;I picked up her Fife accent.And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland.And so she must have taken the ferry over.You notice that the coat she&#39;s carryingis too small for the child who is with her,and therefore, she started out the journey with two children,but dropped one off along the way.You notice the clay on the soles of her feet.Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh,except in the botanical gardens.And therefore, she took a short cut down Inverleith Rowto arrive here.And finally, she has a dermatitison the fingers of her right hand,a dermatitis that is uniqueto the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland.&quot;And when Bell actually strips the patient,begins to examine the patient,you can only imagine how much more he would discern.And as a teacher of medicine, as a student myself,I was so inspired by that story.

zh-cn:也许你们还没有意识到我们的这种利用各种感官以一种简单的方式检查身体的能力并没有太久历史这张照片是利奥波德·奥恩布鲁格他在18世纪末发明了叩诊法故事是这样的利奥波德·奥恩布鲁格的父亲是个旅馆老板他父亲常常去地下室的酒窖敲敲酒桶就能知道还有多少酒要不要追加订单所以当奥恩布鲁格成了内科医生他也开始这么干他开始敲病人的胸腔还有腹部基本上我们对叩诊的认识那是当时的超声波技术－器官扩大，心肺积水异常变化－他在手稿中纪录的一切“新发明”很有可能因为它的晦涩而消失在历史中多亏一位叫科维扎卡的内科医生一位著名的法国内科医生他著名是因为他是奥恩布鲁格的内科医生重新介绍和普及了这部著作
en:But you might not realizethat our ability to look into the bodyin this simple way, using our senses,is quite recent.The picture I&#39;m showing you is of Leopold Auenbruggerwho, in the late 1700s,discovered percussion.And the story is that Leopold Auenbruggerwas the son of an innkeeper.And his father used to go down into the basementto tap on the sides of casks of wineto determine how much wine was leftand whether to reorder.And so when Auenbrugger became a physician,he began to do the same thing.He began to tap on the chests of his patients,on their abdomens.And basically everything we know about percussion,which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day —organ enlargement, fluid around the heart, fluid in the lungs,abdominal changes —all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript&quot;Inventum Novum,&quot; &quot;New Invention,&quot;which would have disappeared into obscurity,except for the fact that this physician, Corvisart,a famous French physician —famous only because he was physician to this gentleman —Corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work.

zh-cn:一两年后莱尼克发明了听诊器据说莱尼克走在巴黎的街上看见两个小孩在玩一根棍子一个在挠棍子的一端另一个听着另一端莱尼克认为用他所谓的“圆筒”听胸腔和腹腔是个很不错的主意后来他重新命名为听诊器这就是听诊器和听诊法的由来几年后19世纪末，20世纪初突然理发医师被进行诊断的内科医生取代
en:And it was followed a year or two laterby Laennec discovering the stethoscope.Laennec, it is said, was walking in the streets of Parisand saw two children playing with a stick.One was scratching at the end of the stick,another child listened at the other end.And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful wayto listen to the chest or listen to the abdomenusing what he called &quot;the cylinder.&quot;Later he renamed it the stethoscope.And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born.So within a few years,in the late 1800s, early 1900s,all of a sudden,the barber surgeon had given wayto the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis.

zh-cn:在那之前不管你病得多么厉害，去了理发医师那儿他们给你拔火罐给你放血，给你冲洗当然如果你愿意的话他也给你理个发－两边短后边长还顺便给你拔个牙完全没有诊断环节也许有些人还记得理发店的标志，红白条纹象征理发医师的绷带两侧的容器象征收集血液的壶但听诊法和叩诊法的出现意味着一个大变化内科医生开始能探视人体内部
en:If you&#39;ll recall, prior to that time,no matter what ailed you, you went to see the barber surgeonwho wound up cupping you,bleeding you, purging you.And, oh yes, if you wanted,he would give you a haircut — short on the sides, long in the back —and pull your tooth while he was at it.He made no attempt at diagnosis.In fact, some of you might well knowthat the barber pole, the red and white stripes,represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon,and the receptacles on either endrepresent the pots in which the blood was collected.But the arrival of auscultation and percussionrepresented a sea change,a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body.

zh-cn:这幅画，我认为代表这那个医疗时代的顶峰这是个非常著名的油画卢克･菲尔德斯的《医生》此画是卢克･菲尔德斯受泰特之托泰特建立了泰特美术馆他请卢克.菲尔德斯画一幅表现社会重要现状的画有趣的是菲尔德斯选择了这个主题菲尔德斯的大儿子，菲利普9岁的时候因为一点小病痛死在了平安夜菲尔德斯被这位守夜守了两三夜的医生深深感动于是他决定试着描绘这个时代的医生－几乎是对这位医生的赞颂因此《医生》这幅著名的画出现在很多国家的挂历上和邮票上我常想，菲尔德斯会怎么办如果他被要求在这个时代画那幅画在2011年？他是不是得把患者换成电脑屏幕？
en:And this particular painting, I think,represents the pinnacle, the peak, of that clinical era.This is a very famous painting:&quot;The Doctor&quot; by Luke Fildes.Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate,who then established the Tate Gallery.And Tate asked Fildes to paint a paintingof social importance.And it&#39;s interesting that Fildes picked this topic.Fildes&#39; oldest son, Philip,died at the age of nine on Christmas Eveafter a brief illness.And Fildes was so taken by the physicianwho held vigil at the bedside for two, three nights,that he decided that he would try and depictthe physician in our time —almost a tribute to this physician.And hence the painting &quot;The Doctor,&quot; a very famous painting.It&#39;s been on calendars, postage stamps in many different countries.I&#39;ve often wondered, what would Fildes have donehad he been asked to paint this paintingin the modern era,in the year 2011?Would he have substituted a computer screenfor where he had the patient?

zh-cn:我因为说病床上的病人基本上只是电脑里真正病人的图标而和硅谷惹上麻烦事实上我为计算机里的那个实体（病人）创造了个新词iPatient全美国的iPatient都得到很好的治疗真的病人倒在奇怪人都哪里去了？他们什么时候来给我解释这些玩意儿？谁负责啊？病人和医生对最佳医疗的认识有着很大的距离
en:I&#39;ve gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valleyfor saying that the patient in the bedhas almost become an iconfor the real patient who&#39;s in the computer.I&#39;ve actually coined a term for that entity in the computer.I call it the iPatient.The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America.The real patient often wonders,where is everyone?When are they going to come by and explain things to me?Who&#39;s in charge?There&#39;s a real disjunction between the patient&#39;s perceptionand our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care.

zh-cn:我想给你们展示我当时的临床实习是什么样的重点都是病人我们一张病床一张病床走过去 当值的医生负责现如今临床实习更像这样讨论是在一个远离病人的房间进行的讨论的场面都是电脑，数据最重要的部分－病人却缺失了
en:I want to show you a pictureof what rounds looked likewhen I was in training.The focus was around the patient.We went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge.Too often these days,rounds look very much like this,where the discussion is taking placein a room far away from the patient.The discussion is all about images on the computer, data.And the one critical piece missingis that of the patient.

zh-cn:我想跟你们分享两个故事我本人深受影响一个是跟我一个患有乳腺癌的朋友有关在发现一个小的乳腺肿瘤后她在我住的那个城市做了手术切除这是我在德克萨斯的时候然后她花了很多时间寻找世界上最好的癌症中心接受后续治疗她找到了然后去了几个月后我很惊讶地看见她回来了在她的私人医生那里接受术后康复
en:Now I&#39;ve been influenced in this thinkingby two anecdotes that I want to share with you.One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer,had a small breast cancer detected —had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived.This is when I was in Texas.And she then spent a lot of time researchingto find the best cancer center in the worldto get her subsequent care.And she found the place and decided to go there, went there.Which is why I was surprised a few months laterto see her back in our own town,getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist.
时间： 9:45
zh-cn:我问她你问什么回来接受康复？她不是很愿意吐露她说，”那个癌症中心非常棒设施一流大堂超级大，服务生停车自动弹奏的钢琴有人待你到处溜达“但是“他们根本没碰我的胸部”现在我们可以说他们也许没有必要碰她的胸部可以扫描嘛他们可以从分子层面了解她的乳腺癌没有必要碰
en:And I pressed her, and I asked her,&quot;Why did you come back and get your care here?&quot;And she was reluctant to tell me.She said, &quot;The cancer center was wonderful.It had a beautiful facility,giant atrium, valet parking,a piano that played itself,a concierge that took you around from here to there.But,&quot; she said,&quot;but they did not touch my breasts.&quot;Now you and I could arguethat they probably did not need to touch her breasts.They had her scanned inside out.They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level;they had no need to touch her breasts.
时间：10:21
zh-cn:但对她来说，这很重要这足够让她决定从她私人医生那里接受康复她去私人医生那里医生会检查两侧乳房包括腋窝端很仔细地检查腋窝检查她的子宫颈和腹股沟一个全面的检查对她来说，这表达了她所需要的关注这件事深深影响了我
en:But to her, it mattered deeply.It was enough for her to make the decisionto get her subsequent care with her private oncologistwho, every time she went,examined both breasts including the axillary tail,examined her axilla carefully,examined her cervical region, her inguinal region,did a thorough exam.And to her, that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed.I was very influenced by that anecdote.
时间：10:48
zh-cn:另外还有一个我的经历同样对我有影响也是我在德克萨斯的时候，还没搬到斯坦福我有个名声在外就是非常关注患有慢性疲劳的病人这不是个坏名声我这么说是因为他们都不容易他们多被家人拒绝有很不如意的医疗经历他们早准备好了你是许多人之后下一个另他们失望的人我从第一个病人身上就早早认识到我无法公平地去查看这位复杂病人的所有纪录一个新病人只有45分钟无可奈何如果我尝试了，我会令他们失望
en:I was also influenced by another experience that I had,again, when I was in Texas, before I moved to Stanford.I had a reputationas being interested in patientswith chronic fatigue.This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy.I say that because these are difficult patients.They have often been rejected by their families,have had bad experiences with medical careand they come to you fully preparedfor you to join the long list of peoplewho&#39;s about to disappoint them.And I learned very early on with my first patientthat I could not do justiceto this very complicated patientwith all the records they were bringingin a new patient visit of 45 minutes.There was just no way.And if I tried, I&#39;d disappoint them.
时间：11:36
zh-cn:所以我的做法是第一次会诊的时候我让病人们给我讲述他们的情况我尝试不去打断我们知道美国医生平均14秒后就打断病人说话如果我能进天堂肯定是因为我能倾听上45分钟而没打断他们然后我会在两周后安排体检当病人来的时候我就能做一个彻底的体检因为这就是我能做的我想我做彻底的检查是因为这个会诊就是为了体检我可以做一个格外细致的检查
en:And so I hit on this methodwhere I invited the patientto tell me the story for their entire first visit,and I tried not to interrupt them.We know the average American physicianinterrupts their patient in 14 seconds.And if I ever get to heaven,it will be because I held my piece for 45 minutesand did not interrupt my patient.I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence,and when the patient came for the physical,I was able to do a thorough physical,because I had nothing else to do.I like to think that I do a thorough physical exam,but because the whole visit was now about the physical,I could do an extraordinarily thorough exam.
时间：12:16
zh-cn:我记得我第一个慢性疲劳病人在他的体检会诊过程中给我讲述更多她的历史我开始了我的仪式我总是从测脉搏开始然后检查手，接下来是甲床然后是滑车上淋巴结由此进入我的仪式当仪式开始这个健谈的病人开始安静下来我记得感受到一种神秘的畏惧感当我和病人都进入到这种原始性的仪式其中我有我的角色而病人有病人的角色当我完成的时候病人怀着敬畏对我说“我从来没有被这样检查过”如果这是真的话是对医疗保健系统的一个真实的谴责因为他们从来没在别的地方经历过
en:And I remember my very first patient in that seriescontinued to tell me more historyduring what was meant to be the physical exam visit.And I began my ritual.I always begin with the pulse,then I examine the hands, then I look at the nail beds,then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node,and I was into my ritual.And when my ritual began,this very voluble patientbegan to quiet down.And I remember having a very eerie sensethat the patient and Ihad slipped back into a primitive ritualin which I had a roleand the patient had a role.And when I was done,the patient said to me with some awe,&quot;I have never been examined like this before.&quot;Now if that were true,it&#39;s a true condemnation of our health care system,because they had been seen in other places.
时间：13:08
zh-cn:等病人穿戴完毕我接着告诉他他肯定在其他医疗机构都听过的内容：“这不是你想像的这是真的好消息是，得的不是癌症，不是肺结核不是球孢子菌病或者什么真菌感染坏消息是我们不清楚是什么导致的你应该做这些，我应该做这些”我会列出病人在其他地方也听过的所有标准治疗的选项
en:I then proceeded to tell the patient,once the patient was dressed,the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions,which is, &quot;This is not in your head.This is real.The good news, it&#39;s not cancer, it&#39;s not tuberculosis,it&#39;s not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection.The bad news is we don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s causing this,but here&#39;s what you should do, here&#39;s what we should do.&quot;And I would lay out all the standard treatment optionsthat the patient had heard elsewhere.
时间：13:37
zh-cn:我总觉得如果我的病人放弃追着某个神奇医生，神奇疗法而转投我开始走向健康那是因为我一丝不苟的检查为我赢得了告诉他们这些的权利通过交流一些重要的信息已经透露我将此讲给在斯坦福大学人类学的同事们告诉他们这个故事他们立刻对我说“你描述了一个经典仪式”他们帮助我理解了仪式意味着转变
en:And I always feltthat if my patient gave up the questfor the magic doctor, the magic treatmentand began with me on a course towards wellness,it was because I had earned the rightto tell them these thingsby virtue of the examination.Something of importance had transpired in the exchange.I took this to my colleaguesat Stanford in anthropologyand told them the same story.And they immediately said to me,&quot;Well you are describing a classic ritual.&quot;And they helped me understandthat rituals are all about transformation.
时间：14:12
zh-cn:举例说，我们结婚用舞会，仪式和花费来宣告孤独寂寞的悲惨生活变成永恒的幸福我不知道你们为什么笑我们结婚原本是这么希望的，是吧？我们通过仪式表达力量的转变我们用仪式表达生命仪式非常重要全部都与转变有关我想告诉你这种仪式一个人来到另一个人面前告诉他一些连神父都不告诉的的事除此之外还换衣解带并让他触碰我想告诉你们这是个极度重要的仪式如果你在仪式上玩花样比如不解衣服隔着睡裙听诊或者检查不完整你已经错过了在医患关系上留下鉴印的机会
en:We marry, for example,with great pomp and ceremony and expenseto signal our departurefrom a life of solitude and misery and lonelinessto one of eternal bliss.I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re laughing.That was the original intent, was it not?We signal transitions of powerwith rituals.We signal the passage of a life with rituals.Rituals are terribly important.They&#39;re all about transformation.Well I would submit to youthat the ritualof one individual coming to anotherand telling them thingsthat they would not tell their preacher or rabbi,and then, incredibly on top of that,disrobing and allowing touch —I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance.And if you shortchange that ritualby not undressing the patient,by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown,by not doing a complete exam,you have bypassed on the opportunityto seal the patient-physician relationship.

zh-cn:我是个作家我想以我写的一段话结尾它与这个场景契合我是个传染病医生在HIV传染早期，还没有治疗方法的时候我经历过如此之多的这样的场景我记得，每次去医院或者病人家里的临死的卧床我总有种失败感－一种无话可说的感觉我不知道说什么好我不知道做什么好带着那种失败感我记得，我总会检查病人看看眼皮看看舌头敲敲胸部 听听心跳按压腹腔我记得很多病人他们的名字仍犹如在耳他们的脸庞仍历历在目我记得很多大而空洞的眼睛在我进行仪式的时候盯着我次日我会再来，再做
en:I am a writer,and I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrotethat has to do very much with this scene.I&#39;m an infectious disease physician,and in the early days of HIV, before we had our medications,I presided over so many scenes like this.I remember, every time I went to a patient&#39;s deathbed,whether in the hospital or at home,I remember my sense of failure —the feeling of I don&#39;t know what I have to say;I don&#39;t know what I can say;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed to do.And out of that sense of failure,I remember, I would always examine the patient.I would pull down the eyelids.I would look at the tongue.I would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart.I would feel the abdomen.I remember so many patients,their names still vivid on my tongue,their faces still so clear.I remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyesstaring up at me as I performed this ritual.And then the next day,I would come, and I would do it again.

zh-cn:我想给各位读的结束语是关于一位病人的“我记得一位病人当时的他瘦骨嶙峋如同干柴无法言语嘴里长满念珠菌这种真菌对普通药物具有抗药性当他看见我时已是他活在人世的最后几个小时他的手像慢镜头一样移动我想他要表达点什么他的干柴一样的手指伸向他的睡衣要解开扣子我意识到他是想给我们看他骨瘦如柴的胸膛那是个邀请我没有拒绝
en:And I wanted to read you this one closing passageabout one patient.&quot;I recall one patientwho was at that pointno more than a skeletonencased in shrinking skin,unable to speak,his mouth crusted with candidathat was resistant to the usual medications.When he saw meon what turned out to be his last hours on this earth,his hands moved as if in slow motion.And as I wondered what he was up to,his stick fingers made their wayup to his pajama shirt,fumbling with his buttons.I realized that he was wantingto expose his wicker-basket chest to me.It was an offering, an invitation.I did not decline.
时间：17:03
zh-cn:我叩诊 触诊 听诊了胸腔我认为他一定知道那对我的重要就想对他的必要一样谁也不能省略这个仪式不是为了听肺部的水泡或是心脏衰弱的跳动不，这个仪式是医生向患者传达的一个信息虽然后来因为我们的傲慢我们把它弄丢了我们好像忘了－虽然有了知识大爆炸整个人类的基因组被绘制出来我们渐渐变得冷漠忘记了仪式是医生的泻药病人很需要－我们忘了仪式具有意义并且将信息传达给病人
en:I percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest.I think he surely must have known by thenthat it was vital for mejust as it was necessary for him.Neither of us could skip this ritual,which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung,or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure.No, this ritual was about the one messagethat physicians have needed to convey to their patients.Although, God knows, of late, in our hubris,we seem to have drifted away.We seem to have forgotten —as though, with the explosion of knowledge,the whole human genome mapped out at our feet,we are lulled into inattention,forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician,necessary for the patient —forgetting that the ritual has meaningand a singular message to convey to the patient.
时间：17:51
zh-cn:这个信息虽然我当时传递给了病人但我并没有完全理解现在我更好地理解了：我会永远，永远，永远在这里我会陪你经历这一切我永远不会抛弃你我会陪你到最后
en:And the message, which I didn&#39;t fully understand then,even as I delivered it,and which I understand better now is this:I will always, always, always be there.I will see you through this.I will never abandon you.I will be with you through the end.&quot;
