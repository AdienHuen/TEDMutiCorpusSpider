zh-cn:过去的10年时间我一直处于悲伤和羞辱中期待着有一个好的理由改变自己这个理由就是自我提高于是我从三方面开始做起首先从心智开始我决定试着让自己聪明点比如阅读大英百科全书从头到尾通读更确切的说是从第一个词&quot;a-ak&quot;读到最后一个词&quot;Zywiec&quot;。现在已经没什么太大印象了这是不可思议的一年整个过程很吸引人有时也很痛苦尤其对我身边的人来说更是如此每当我在谈话时加入一些在大英百科全书中读到的与谈话无关的事实时我妻子就会罚我一美元所以说这也有不好的一面
en:I&#39;ve spent the last decadesubjecting myself to pain and humiliation,hopefully for a good cause,which is self-improvement.And I&#39;ve done this in three parts.So first I started with the mind.And I decided to try to get smarterby reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannicafrom A to Z —or, more precisely, from &quot;a-ak&quot; to &quot;Zywiec.&quot;And here&#39;s a little image of that.And this was an amazing year.It was really a fascinating journey.It was painful at times,especially for those around me.My wife started to fine me one dollarfor every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.So it had its downsides.

zh-cn:但这之后我决定在精神层面上做些文章就像我去年提到的那样我从小就没有宗教信仰我是犹太人像美式Olive Garden餐厅里做的意大利餐那样，我不像传统的犹太人（笑声）真的不像但是我决定去了解一下圣经和犹太传统文化通过真正进入到其中让自己完全融入到那个环境中去所以我决定遵循圣经的所有条例从十戒到蓄起胡须—因为《利未记》要求人们不许剔除胡须所以这就是我最后的样子谢谢你们对此的反应（笑声）我看起来有点像摩西，或是泰德·卡钦斯基都挺像的这张修剪了一下这就是那只羊
en:But after that,I decided to work on the spirit.As I mentioned last year,I grew up with no religion at all.I&#39;m Jewish,but I&#39;m Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.(Laughter)Not really.But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritageby actually diving inand trying to live it and immerse myself in it.So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.And from the Ten Commandmentsto growing my beard —because Leviticus says you cannot shave.So this is what I looked like by the end.Thank you for that reaction.(Laughter)I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.I got both of them.So there was the topiary there.And there&#39;s the sheep.

zh-cn:最后一步是我希望注重自己的身体尽可能达到最健康的状态成为世上最健康的人所以过去几年内我做了刚才提到的那些事情我几个月前才刚刚停下来我必须要说，谢天谢地终于结束了因为那种健康的生活方式快要害死我了（笑声）太让人受不了了因为有许多你不得不做的事情数量多的让人难以置信我听取了所有专家的意见和许多医疗顾问交流他们告诉我所有必需做的事情我必须正确膳食锻炼，冥想，养宠物因为那样可以降低血压我在跑步机上写书为了这本书，我跑了近1000公里我必须涂防晒霜这可是个大工程因为如果你严格遵医嘱的话皮肤专家会告诉你，你要准备满满一玻璃杯的防晒霜同时，必须每2-4个小时再涂一次所以我觉得我的书的前一半都是关于防晒霜的我一年中大部分时间就像个光滑的甜甜圈关于洗手方面必须洗的正确免疫学家告诉我我必须仔细擦拭家里所有的遥控器和iPhone因为它们滋生大量的细菌这件事花费了我大量时间
en:Now the final part of the trilogywas I wanted to focus on the bodyand try to be the healthiest person I could be,the healthiest person alive.So that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing the last couple of years.And I just finished a couple of months ago.And I have to say, thank God.Because living so healthily was killing me.(Laughter)It was so overwhelming,because the amount of things you have to do,it&#39;s just mind-boggling.I was listening to all the expertsand talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.And they were telling meall the things I had to do.I had to eat right,exercise, meditate, pet dogs,because that lowers the blood pressure.I wrote the book on a treadmill,and it took me about a thousand milesto write the book.I had to put on sunscreen.This was no small feat,because if you listen to dermatologists,they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.And you have to reapply it every two to four hours.So I think half of my book advancewent into sunscreen.I was like a glazed doughnutfor most of the year.There was the washing of hands.I had to do that properly.And my immunologist told methat I should also wipe downall of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,because those are just orgies of germs.So that took a lot of time.

zh-cn:我还尽我所能做个最安全的人因为这也是健康的一部分我受到丹麦安全委员会的启发他们发起一个公益活动口号是：“步行专用头盔是个好头盔”他们认为不仅仅要在骑单车的时候戴头盔走路的时候同样需要如你所见他们连购物都带着头盔（笑声）恩，我也尝试了我承认这看来有些极端但是如果你想一下这实际上是因为—《魔鬼经济学》的作者写到过—以一英里为基准，死于酒后步行的人多过死于酒后驾驶的人如果你已经结婚了你应该思考一下这个问题
en:I also tried to be the safest person I could be,because that&#39;s a part of health.I was inspiredby the Danish Safety Council.They started a public campaignthat says, &quot;A walking helmet is a good helmet.&quot;So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking,but also for walking around.And you can see therethey&#39;re shopping with their helmets.(Laughter)Well yeah, I tried that.Now it&#39;s a little extreme, I admit.But if you think about this,this is actually — the &quot;Freakonomics&quot; authors wrote about this —that more people die on a per mile basisfrom drunk walkingthan from drunk driving.So something to think about tonightif you&#39;ve had a couple.

zh-cn:所以我完成了这些事情某种程度上说是成功的所有的指标都变得正常了我的胆固醇下降了，体重减轻了我妻子也不说我看上去像个孕妇了这非常棒总的来说是成功的但是我同样意识到，我过于健康了这本身也是不健康的我过度专注于做那些事情却忽视了我的朋友和家庭就像丹·布特纳告诉大家的那样拥有一个广泛的社交网对我们的健康至关重要
en:So I finished,and it was a success in a sense.All of the markers went in the right direction.My cholesterol went down, I lost weight,my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.So that was nice.And it was successful overall.But I also learned that I was too healthy,and that was unhealthy.I was so focused on doing all these thingsthat I was neglecting my friends and family.And as Dan Buettner can tell you,having a strong social networkis so crucial to our health.

zh-cn:我于是停止了这些健康计划健康计划中止后的一周我让自己稍微放纵了一下开始了不健康的生活方式尽情放任自己有点像《罗马帝国艳情史》里那样（笑声）当然这里可没有关于性的部分因为我已经有三个孩子了因此不是你想的那样不过大吃大喝是肯定要有的最后就稳定下来了我现在又回到从前的我了我保留了许多过去一年中尝试过的方法—当然不是全部我再也不带头盔了但是还是保留了不少健康的生活习惯这真是个能够改变生活的计划当然，我没有足够的时间去逐个体验我只简单告诉大家两件事
en:So I finished.And I kind of went overboardon the week after the project was over.I went to the dark side,and I just indulged myself.It was like something out of Caligula.(Laughter)Without the sex part.Because I have three young kids,so that wasn&#39;t happening.But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely.And I finally have stabilized.So now I&#39;m backto adopting many — not all; I don&#39;t wear a helmet anymore —but dozens of healthy behaviorsthat I adopted during my year.It was really a life-changing project.And I, of course, don&#39;t have time to go into all of them.Let me just tell you two really quickly.

zh-cn:首先是—一件让我感到惊讶的事情我之前并没有抱这个期望—但现在我却有了一个更安静的生活我们生活在一个嘈杂的世界充斥着火车、飞机、汽车和比尔·奥雷利（美国时事评论员），他吵死了（笑声）这的确是一个被低估、被忽视的健康隐患—不仅仅是因为它有损听力，这点是毫无疑问的它实际上还会让人产生“攻击或逃离”这个心理应急机制高分贝噪声会让你启动应急机制这样持续数年会造成真正的损伤，心血管损伤世界卫生组织做了一个大型研究并于今年出版研究在欧洲进行他们预计人类过去160万年形成的健康生活方式在欧洲逐年减少这正是由于噪音污染他们认为噪音污染的确是非常致命的
en:The first is — and this was surprising to me;I didn&#39;t expect this to come out —but I live a much quieter life now.Because we live in such a noisy world.There&#39;s trains and planes and carsand Bill O&#39;Reilly, he&#39;s very noisy.(Laughter)And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard —not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does,but it actually initiatesthe fight-or-flight response.A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going.And this, over the years,can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.The World Health Organization just did a big studythat they published this year.And it was done in Europe.And they estimatedthat 1.6 million years of healthy livingare lost every year in Europebecause of noise pollution.So they think it&#39;s actually very deadly.

zh-cn:同时它还对人的大脑非常有害噪音污染会损害认知能力我们的建国先父们认识到了这些他们制定宪法的时候把泥土涂满白宫外面的鹅卵石这样他们就可以集中精力因此没有消除噪音技术我们的国家就不会存在作为一名爱国者我觉得这非常重要我戴着耳塞和耳机这对我的生活确实很有帮助出乎我的意料，超出了我的期望
en:And by the way,it&#39;s also terrible for your brain.It really impairs cognition.And our Founding Fathers knew about this.When they wrote the Constitution,they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hallso that they could concentrate.So without noise reduction technology,our country would not exist.So as a patriot,I felt it was important to —I wear all the earplugs and the earphones,and it&#39;s really improved my lifein a surprising and unexpected way.

zh-cn:我想说的第二点，也是最后一点实际上就是TEDMED的主题—快乐对人的健康非常重要要不是这些行为可以带给我快乐和愉悦的感觉我很难能坚持下来举一个例子食物垃圾食品行业特别擅长开启我们的愉悦感并带给我们最快乐的感受但是我想我们可以将他们的技术应用到健康食品领域比如说我们喜欢脆脆的口感于是我试着把这种脆脆的口感加入到我的许多食谱中—比如放一些葵花籽进去你就会有像吃多力多滋（玉米片）一样的口感（笑声）这使我变得更健康
en:And the second point I want to make, the final point,is that — and it&#39;s actually been a theme of TEDMED —that joy is so important to your health,that very few of these behaviorswill stick with meunless there&#39;s some sense of pleasure and joy in them.And just to give you one instance of this:food.The junk food industryis really greatat pressing our pleasure buttonsand figuring out what&#39;s the most pleasurable.But I think we can use their techniquesand apply them to healthy food.To give just one example,we love crunchiness, mouthfeel.So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchinessinto a lot of my recipes —throw in some sunflower seeds.And you can almost trick yourselfinto thinking you&#39;re eating Doritos.(Laughter)And it has made me a healthier person.

zh-cn:就是这些这本书四月面世书名叫做“不要盲目追求健康”我希望新书宣传的时候我不要病倒这是我最大的愿望
en:So that is it.The book about it comes out in April.It&#39;s called &quot;Drop Dead Healthy.&quot;And I hope that I don&#39;t get sick during the book tour.That&#39;s my greatest hope.
