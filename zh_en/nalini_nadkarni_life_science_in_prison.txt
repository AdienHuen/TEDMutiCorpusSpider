zh-cn:树象征静止于好几个世代中树都植根于同一地区的同一块土地但是如果我们将注意力由树干转移到树枝树木的活力就显现出来了它一直在活动及成长因此我决定开始探索树枝我认为树木是位艺术家为什么呢 我在细枝的末端绑上一枝画笔然后静待风起 撑起画布一幅艺术品就此完成你现在看到在左边那幅图就是由北美香柏所画的右边那幅则是花旗松的作品我发现不同的树种所留下的图型特征不同 就像毕加索和莫奈的画风不同一样
en:Trees epitomize stasis.Trees are rooted in the ground in one placefor many human generations,but if we shift our perspectivefrom the trunk to the twigs,trees become very dynamic entities,moving and growing.And I decided to explore this movementby turning trees into artists.I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas,and that produced art.The piece of art you see on your leftis painted by a western red cedarand that on your right by a Douglas fir,and what I learned was that different specieshave different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.

zh-cn:我不仅对树木的活力感兴趣还对将图上的活动轨迹量化也很有兴趣为测量创作这幅画的藤枫一年内所移动的距离我测量这图上每条线的长度而后加总然后乘上每个树枝上细枝数目及每棵树有多少树枝数目再乘以每年的分钟数这样我就可以算出每一株树每年的移动距离你可以猜猜看答案是186,540英里(约30万公里)也就是绕着地球转七圈的长度。所以只要将观注的重点由一株树干转移至许多动态的细枝我们就可以看出树木不只是静止的它的动作可还大着呢
en:But I was also interested in the movement of treesand how this art might let me capture that and quantify it,so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree —which produced this painting — moved in a single year,I simply measured and summedeach of those lines.I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branchand the number of branches per treeand then divided that by the number of minutes per year.And so I was able to calculatehow far a single tree moved in a single year.You might have a guess.The answer is actually 186,540 miles,or seven times around the globe.And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunkto the many dynamic twigs,we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities,but rather extremely dynamic.

zh-cn:接着我想到由树木移动所学到的启示是不是可以应用在其它呼喊着要改变 要自由的静态或被限制行动的事物上呢监狱就是一例监狱当然是为要将作奸犯科者困于牢栏之后但是我们的监狱体系却自困一角美国有二百三十万位被监禁的男女囚犯而且数目还在持续上升在一百个出狱的囚犯里有六十个会再回笼但是用在教育训练辅导罪犯改过迁善的经费却一直在减少所以整个监禁体系是在令人绝望的循环中不断重复我决定去探究是否可以将把树当作艺术家的经验运用在像监狱这样静态停滞不前的机构上我发现答案是可行的
en:And I began to think about ways thatwe might consider this lesson of trees,to consider other entities that are also static and stuck,but which cry for change and dynamicism,and one of those entities is our prisons.Prisons, of course, are where people who break our lawsare stuck, confined behind bars.And our prison system itself is stuck.The United States has over 2.3 millionincarcerated men and women.That number is rising.Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released,60 will return to prison.Funds for education, for trainingand for rehabilitation are declining,so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.I decided to ask whether the lessonI had learned from trees as artistscould be applied to a static institutionsuch as our prisons,and I think the answer is yes.

zh-cn:在2007年我开始和华盛顿州的囚犯矫正部门合作选定四个监狱 引进科学实验及科学家在这四个州立监狱里 进行永续发展我们给这四个监狱的囚犯上科学课程这些人选择来上我们提供的科学课程而不是去看电视或举重我认为这才是行动我们和自然保育局合作请史塔佛溪矫正中心的囚犯种植濒临绝种的草原植物用来重建华盛顿州的荒废草原这就是我认为的改变我们也和华盛顿州的鱼类及野生动物部门合作养殖滨临绝种的奥勒岗州斑蛙然后放回湿地保护区这就是我认为的改变
en:In the year 2007,I started a partnershipwith the Washington State Department of Corrections.Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists,sustainability and conservation projectsto four state prisons.We give science lectures,and the men here are choosing to come to our science lecturesinstead of watching television or weightlifting.That, I think, is movement.We partnered with the Nature Conservancyfor inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Centerto grow endangered prairie plantsfor restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.That, I think, is movement.We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlifeto grow endangered frogs — the Oregon spotted frog —for later release into protected wetlands.That, I think, is movement.

zh-cn:最近我们开始和被隔离在戒备最森严的牢房里的重刑犯合作他们都曾经与警卫或是其他囚犯有过暴力冲突他们每天都被关在像这样的囚室里 23个小时当他们与审查委员或心理专家会面时他们是被安置在这样一个固定的隔离房间里他们每天仅有一小时的时间可以在这个单调乏味的运动场放风虽然我们不被允许将树草原植物或是蛙类带入这样的环境但是我们选择将自然的影像带入运动场挂在墙壁上，这样至少他们在视觉上在视觉上还可以与自然接触这位是已经被单独监禁了18个月的Lopez先生他对这样的图片提供意见表示他相信这会使他以及其他囚犯有较安详镇定的感觉不易诉之暴力
en:And just recently, we&#39;ve begun to work withthose men who are segregatedin what we call Supermax facilities.They&#39;ve incurred violent infractionsby becoming violent with guardsand with other prisoners.They&#39;re kept in bare cells like thisfor 23 hours a day.When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals,they&#39;re placed in immobile booths like this.For one hour a daythey&#39;re brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.Although we can&#39;t bring trees and prairie plantsand frogs into these environments,we are bringing images of natureinto these exercise yards,putting them on the walls, so at least they get contactwith visual images of nature.This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months,and he&#39;s providing input on the types of imagesthat he believes would make him and his fellow inmatesmore serene, more calm,less apt to violence.

zh-cn:由前述 我们看到一个微小但是集体性的行动改变或许可以推动像监狱体系这样的个体往看得见希望的方向前进我们知道光只看树干的话树是静止的如果让树自由创作如果树一年能够绕地球七次如果囚犯都可以种植植物 养殖蛙类那么也许深藏在我们心中那些顽固的想法如哀伤 沉溺种族偏见等等皆可改变
en:And so what we see, I think,is that small, collective movements of changecan perhaps movean entity such as our own prison systemin a direction of hope.We know that trees are static entitieswhen we look at their trunks.But if trees can create art,if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year,if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs,then perhaps there are other static entitiesthat we hold inside ourselves,like grief, like addictions,like racism,that can also change.
