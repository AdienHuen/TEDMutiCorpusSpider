zh-cn:我对科技一无所知,我女儿, — 现在41岁了 —在她五岁的时候,被我无意中听到对她的一个小朋友说,任何你切下去不会流血的东西,我爸爸是不会理解的.(笑声)所以, 我接到的这个任务对我来说也许非常难以完成,但我一定要尝试.
en:You know, I am so bad at techthat my daughter — who is now 41 —when she was five, was overheard by meto say to a friend of hers,If it doesn&#39;t bleed when you cut it,my daddy doesn&#39;t understand it.(Laughter)So, the assignment I&#39;ve been givenmay be an insuperable obstacle for me,but I&#39;m certainly going to try.

zh-cn:在过去的四天里,我所到的是什么?这是我第三次来TED.一个是TEDMED, 另一个也许你听过,是两年前的TED常规演讲.我所考虑到的是很特别的事情我只听说一点之前的两次TED演讲,很多演讲里是一种内容的交织一种混合, 一种思维的碰撞,传达着社会责任感以及全球的责任感,事实上他们是在启发大家的个人兴趣,但效果远远超出了兴趣的启发.印象最深刻的一件事就是大概有十位讲师,曾经演讲过认识你认真的听他们讲, 他们并不是在讲:好,这些是我们应该做的,这些是我想让你们去做的.而是在讲: 这些是我已经做的因为我很热爱它,因为它是一个美好的东西, 它对我有着不同的意义,当然, 它们也伴随着不错的成就.这是比较古老的希腊概念是一种内心深处的善念:博爱: 人类之爱.
en:What have I heardduring these last four days?This is my third visit to TED.One was to TEDMED, and one, as you&#39;ve heard,was a regular TED two years ago.I&#39;ve heard what I consider an extraordinary thingthat I&#39;ve only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs,and what that is is an interweavingand an interlarding, an intermixing,of a sense of social responsibilityin so many of the talks —global responsibility, in fact,appealing to enlightened self-interest,but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest.One of the most impressive thingsabout what some, perhaps 10,of the speakers have been talking aboutis the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they&#39;re not saying:Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do.It&#39;s: This is what I have donebecause I&#39;m excited by it,because it&#39;s a wonderful thing, and it&#39;s done something for meand, of course, it&#39;s accomplished a great deal.It&#39;s the old concept, the real Greek concept,of philanthropy in its original sense:phil-anthropy, the love of humankind.

zh-cn:对于你过去四天所听到的内容,我能给的唯一解释就是那是爱的起源,实事上, 是爱的其它形势.这给了我极大的希望.希望, 当然是我这次要演讲的主题,但直到到这里时我才完全想起来.然后,我想好吧,我最好先查查这个词在字典里是什么意思.所以, 我和Sarah(我老婆) 去了公共图书馆,离太平洋大街只有四个街区的路, 然后我们拿了OED.我们查到了希望的14种定义,没有一个合适的解释能真正打动你.当然, 这也合情合理,因为希望是一个抽象的现象和概念,并不只是个实词.
en:And the only explanation I can havefor some of what you&#39;ve been hearing in the last four daysis that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love.And this gives me enormous hope.And hope, of course, is the topicthat I&#39;m supposed to be speaking about,which I&#39;d completely forgotten about until I arrived.And when I did, I thought,well, I&#39;d better look this word up in the dictionary.So, Sarah and I — my wife — walked over to the public library,which is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED,and we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope,none of which really hits youbetween the eyes as being the appropriate one.And, of course, that makes sense,because hope is an abstract phenomenon; it&#39;s an abstract idea,it&#39;s not a concrete word.

zh-cn:这就像一个小的手术.如果一种手术治愈这种疾病,你知道这行的通.如果有15种手术选择, 你知道这些是没一个能行的.并且他们有词语的定义.如果你得了阑尾炎,他们会把阑尾拿掉,你的病就好了.如果你得了逆流食道炎, 他们有15种治疗方法,Joe Schmo 会选这种方法Will Blow会选另外一种方法,但是都不确定能治好, 所以, 就有个词形容这种情况, 希望.他们都归结于一个概念,就是好的事情会发生.你猜我发现了什么?希望这个单词在印欧语系中起源是K-E-U —我们都可以拼写 K-E-U, 它的发音和koy一样 —它跟单词curve是同一个起源.但它在古印欧语系的含义是另一个意思,
en:Well, it reminds me a little bit of surgery.If there&#39;s one operation for a disease, you know it works.If there are 15 operations, you know that none of them work.And that&#39;s the way it is with definitions of words.If you have appendicitis, they take your appendix out, and you&#39;re cured.If you&#39;ve got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures,and Joe Schmo does it one wayand Will Blow does it another way,and none of them work, and that&#39;s the way it is with this word, hope.They all come down to the idea of an expectationof something good that is due to happen.And you know what I found out?The Indo-European root of the word hopeis a stem, K-E-U —we would spell it K-E-U; it&#39;s pronounced koy —and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.But what it means in the original Indo-Europeanis a change in direction, going in a different way.

zh-cn:我觉得很有意思,很有挑逗性,因为你过去听到的一些东西,都是不同方向的一些概念:针对一些特定问题的方向.有不同的模型.过去四天里,你听到好多次模型这个单词,并且每个人都很熟悉库恩模型.所以,当我们提到希望,我们必须先从别的方向思考而不是以前的思维定势.还有关于希望的另一种解释 — 没有定义, 但有描述一直非常吸引我, 是Václav Havel的一个理论,出自于他的著作&quot;Breaking the Peace&quot;在书中他提到并不是对事物会朝好的方向发展的期待形成了希望,而是基于对事物的理性期待.与如何发展无关.
en:And I find that very interesting and very provocative,because what you&#39;ve been hearing in the last couple of daysis the sense of going in different directions:directions that are specific and unique to problems.There are different paradigms.You&#39;ve heard that word several times in the last four days,and everyone&#39;s familiar with Kuhnian paradigms.So, when we think of hope now,we have to think of looking in other directionsthan we have been looking.There&#39;s another — not definition, but description, of hopethat has always appealed to me, and it was one by Václav Havelin his perfectly spectacular book &quot;Breaking the Peace,&quot;in which he says that hopedoes not consist of the expectation that things willcome out exactly right,but the expectation that they will make senseregardless of how they come out.

zh-cn:我并不是说我对几天前Dean Kamen幽默华丽的演讲的最后一句话持不同的意见.我当时不确定有没有理解他的意思,所以我在休息时去找他.他当时正在跟一个大块头说话, 我不在意.我打断他们,说:&quot;你是这样说的吗?&quot;他说, &quot;我想是的.&quot;所以, 我在这里重复一下他的话.&quot;世界将不会被保存在互联网之中&quot;这是对的, 你知道世界应该保存在哪里吗?我告诉你, 它会被保存在人类的精神之中.人类的精神, 我并不是说神赐的,也不是指任何超限超自然的东西 —更不是来自于这些怀疑者.我是指我们每个人所拥有的超越自身的一些能力;然后自我实现,取得一些以前认为自己无法实现的成果.从最基础的层次看,我们能感受到出生时的精神.有些能从实验室中感受到;有些能从工作台上感受到.有些从音乐会上感受到.我曾经在手术室,护理室里感受到.这是我们超越自己的一种提升.再需要一些时间我想, 这就是过去几天,我们这么多演讲者所传达出的点点滴滴的人类的精神.如果有一样东西在这个房间里弥漫这正是人类的精神.
en:I can&#39;t tell you how reassured I wasby the very last sentencein that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago.I wasn&#39;t sure I heard it right,so I found him in one of the inter-sessions.He was talking to a very large man, but I didn&#39;t care.I interrupted, and I said, &quot;Did you say this?&quot;He said, &quot;I think so.&quot;So, here&#39;s what it is: I&#39;ll repeat it.&quot;The world will not be saved by the Internet.&quot;It&#39;s wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by?I&#39;ll tell you. It&#39;ll be saved by the human spirit.And by the human spirit, I don&#39;t mean anything divine,I don&#39;t mean anything supernatural —certainly not coming from this skeptic.What I mean is this abilitythat each of us hasto be something greater than herself or himself;to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve somethingthat at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of.On an elemental level, we have all feltthat spirituality at the time of childbirth.Some of you have felt it in laboratories;some of you have felt it at the workbench.We feel it at concerts.I&#39;ve felt it in the operating room, at the bedside.It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves.And I think that it&#39;s going to be, in time,the elements of the human spirit that we&#39;ve been hearing aboutbit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days.And if there&#39;s anything that has permeated this room,it is precisely that.

zh-cn:我一直着迷于19世纪早期所提出的一个概念.实际上, 在19世纪20年代 —一个名叫Percy Shelley的27岁诗人.我们都认为那是Shelley,显然是一个伟大的浪漫主义诗人;我们中很多人往往忘记他曾写过的一些完美的,美丽的散文,在那些琅琅上口的散文中有一篇叫做&quot;A Defence of Poetry.&quot;大概有七八页长,在第三页里,内容深入并比较难懂,但第二页的某个地方他开始讨论一个概念,这个被他称为&quot;道德想像力.&quot;他的诗,简单的翻译为:一个男人 — 正常的男人 —一个男人, 为了更好更强大,必须清晰的想像.他必须能从别人的眼中去观察自己和这个世界,从很多人的眼中.从别人眼中看自己和这个世界 — 不只是这个世界, 更看清他自己.
en:I&#39;m intrigued bya concept that was brought to lifein the early part of the 19th century —actually, in the second decade of the 19th century —by a 27-year-old poetwhose name was Percy Shelley.Now, we all think that Shelleyobviously is the great romantic poet that he was;many of us tend to forget that he wrotesome perfectly wonderful essays, too,and the most well-remembered essayis one called &quot;A Defence of Poetry.&quot;Now, it&#39;s about five, six, seven, eight pages long,and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page,but somewhere on the second pagehe begins talking about the notionthat he calls &quot;moral imagination.&quot;And here&#39;s what he says, roughly translated:A man — generic man —a man, to be greatly good,must imagine clearly.He must see himself and the worldthrough the eyes of another,and of many others.See himself and the world — not just the world, but see himself.

zh-cn:这就是去了解几十亿人类对我们的期待是什么Laurie Garrett那天贴切描述的所谓的绝望或不公?到底是什么让世界有权去要求我们付出?到底是什么让我们有权要求我们自己为了我们共同的人性和人类的精神而付出?你知道答案是什么.那里有很多争论关于我们作为一个大国,应不应该作为世界警察维护世界和平,但应该没有关于我们是否应该成为世界的治疗者的争吵.过去的四天里, 在这个房间里更不会有那样的争吵.
en:What is it that is expected of usby the billions of peoplewho live in what Laurie Garrett the other dayso appropriately calleddespair and disparity?What is it that they have every rightto ask of us?What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves,out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit?Well, you know precisely what it is.There&#39;s a great deal of argumentabout whether we, as the great nation that we are,should be the policeman of the world,the world&#39;s constabulary,but there should be virtually no argumentabout whether we should be the world&#39;s healer.There has certainly been no argument about thatin this room in the past four days.

zh-cn:所以,如果我们成为世界的治疗者,世界上的每一个弱势群体 —包括美国 — 都成为我们的病人.每个弱势的国家, 也可能包括我们的国家,成为我们的病人.单词病人&quot;patient&quot;在语源学的意思很有趣.它起源于拉丁语(patior), 愿意是容忍和忍受.所以, 你再看看古印欧语系的根源,你就会发现 —古印欧语系发间为payen —我们可以拼写为 P-A-E-N —, 然后看吧,这个字跟同情这个单词有相同的词根, P-A-E-N.
en:So, if we are to be the world&#39;s healer,every disadvantaged person in this world —including in the United States — becomes our patient.Every disadvantaged nation, and perhaps our own nation,becomes our patient.So, it&#39;s fun to think about the etymology of the word &quot;patient.&quot;It comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer.So, you go back to the old Indo-European root again,and what do you find? The Indo-European stem is pronounced payen —we would spell it P-A-E-N — and, lo and behold, mirabile dictu,it is the same root as the word compassion comes from, P-A-E-N.

zh-cn:所以, 这节课很清楚. 这节课就是我们的病人 —这个世界, 以及世界上的弱势群体 —这些病人值得我们去同情.但有些东西远远超越于同情怜悯之心,那就是我们的道德想像力和我们对生活在这个世界上的其他人的认同感,不是他们当成一大片森林,而是一颗一颗独立的树.当然, 目前来说, 重要的是不要让华盛顿政府的那些树木(指布什总统的政府) —碍事.(笑声)所以, 我们现在在这里,我们在这里,应该在道德上把自己置于世界的治疗者的身份.我们有一次又一次发生的例子 —你仅听听过去的15分钟 —人们不仅有这样的使命,而且相当有领袖风采和才华横溢 —我觉得在这间屋子大家都才华横溢, — 天啊才华横溢至少让这些人在追寻成功的路上有着非常好的开局,并且毫不犹豫的继续追求成功,直到越来越多的人加入他们.
en:So, the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient —the world, and the disadvantaged of the world —that patient deserves our compassion.But beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion,is our moral imaginationand our identification with each individualwho lives in that world,not to think of them as a huge forest,but as individual trees.Of course, in this day and age, the trick is not to let each treebe obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get —can get in the way.(Laughter)So, here we are.We are, should be,morally committed tobeing the healer of the world.And we have had examples over and over and over again —you&#39;ve just heard one in the last 15 minutes —of people who have not only had that commitment,but had the charisma, the brilliance —and I think in this room it&#39;s easy to use the word brilliant, my God —the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginningof their quest,and who no doubt will continue to succeed,as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause.

zh-cn:现在, 如果我们讨论医学,我们讨论治疗别人,我想要引用一个从来没被引用过的作家.对我来说,世界上的每个人都在这里被引用过:Pogo经常被引用;莎士比亚被各种引用.我想引用我自家的神灵的话.我怀疑他是不是真的说过,因为我不知道希波克拉底(西方版李时珍)说过什么,但我知道一个伟大的希腊物理学家曾经说过,被记录于希波克拉底著作的一本名为&quot;Precepts.&quot;的书我会给你读出来.记住,我一直谈论的是博爱:人类的爱,人与人之间转化为行动的那种爱,在某些情况下, 转化为自身的利益.这就是他, 两千四百年前:&quot;凡是有人类之爱存在的地方,就是治疗的爱的力量&quot;今天我们在这里已经亲眼见证带着理性,带着敏感的心 —在过去的三天里,带着坚忍不拔的人类的精神的力量.非常感谢.(掌声)
en:Now, if we&#39;re talkingabout medicine,and we&#39;re talking about healing,I&#39;d like to quote someone who hasn&#39;t been quoted.It seems to me everybody in the world&#39;s been quoted here:Pogo&#39;s been quoted;Shakespeare&#39;s been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out.I would like to quote one of my own household gods.I suspect he never really said this,because we don&#39;t know what Hippocrates really said,but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicianssaid the following,and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates,and the book is called &quot;Precepts.&quot;And I&#39;ll read you what it is.Remember, I have been talking about,essentially philanthropy:the love of humankind, the individual humankindand the individual humankindthat can bring that kind of lovetranslated into action,translated, in some cases, into enlightened self-interest.And here he is, 2,400 years ago:&quot;Where there is love of humankind,there is love of healing.&quot;We have seen that here todaywith the sense,with the sensitivity —and in the last three days,and with the power of the indomitable human spirit.Thank you very much.(Applause)
