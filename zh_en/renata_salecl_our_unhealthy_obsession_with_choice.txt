zh-cn:我在准备这次演讲的时候搜索了几句名言希望和大家分享好消息是：我找到了三句我特别喜欢的句子第一句是 塞缪尔·约翰逊的：”当你在人生中抉择时别忘了过生活“第二句是 埃斯库罗斯的 他曾提醒我们：“选择幸福你需要付出”第三句是 格劳乔·马克斯的他说：“我不愿意进入任何一个希望我成为其中一员的俱乐部”
en:When I was preparing for this talk,I went to search for a couple of quotesthat I can share with you.Good news: I found threethat I particularly liked,the first by Samuel Johnson, who said,&quot;When making your choice in life,do not forget to live,&quot;the second by Aeschylus, who reminded us that&quot;happiness is a choice that requires effort,&quot;and the third is one by Groucho Marxwho said, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to choose to belongto any club that would have me as a member.&quot;

zh-cn:现在 坏消息是我不知道该选这三句中的哪一句来和大家分享心里有点甜美的选择焦虑
en:Now, bad news:I didn&#39;t know which one of these quotesto choose and share with you.The sweet anxiety of choice.

zh-cn:在当今的后工业社会中选择 个人自由和自我造就都被提升到理想层面如今 与此一并 我们有了种信仰相信进展会永无止境然而 这种意识形态的阴暗面是愈来愈多的焦虑罪恶感对自身的不满和愧于自己的选择悲哀的是 自由抉择的意识形态阻碍了我们对于社会改变的思考看来 这种意识形态实际上能非常有效地安抚我们这些政治和社会思想者我们不再批判社会反之 我们更着重于自我批判有时候还会达到自我毁灭的地步
en:In today&#39;s times of post-industrial capitalism,choice, together with individual freedomand the idea of self-making,has been elevated to an ideal.Now, together with this, we also have a beliefin endless progress.But the underside of this ideologyhas been an increase of anxiety,feelings of guilt,feelings of being inadequate,feeling that we are failing in our choices.Sadly, this ideology of individual choicehas prevented us from thinking about social changes.It appears that this ideology was actuallyvery efficient in pacifying usas political and social thinkers.Instead of making social critiques,we are more and more engaging in self-critique,sometimes to the point of self-destruction.

zh-cn:那么 为什么那种选择的意识形态仍旧如此强大即便是对于那些没有多少选择的人来说也是如此？为何甚至连贫穷的人也仍旧能分辨抉择作出我们所信奉的理性选择？
en:Now, how come that ideology of choiceis still so powerful,even among people who havenot many things to choose among?How come that even people who are poorvery much still identify with the idea of choice,the kind of rational idea of choicewhich we embrace?

zh-cn:选择的意识有益于为我们打开思维的空间来想象未来让我给大家举个例子我的朋友 马尼亚当时是加利福尼亚大学的学生同时为一个汽车营销商工作来赚钱当马尼亚 遇到一些典型的客户时 她便会和他们讨论其生活方式其预算值有多少孩子买车的目的等问题通常他们都会得出一个不错的结论决定好哪辆车最适合不过 在马尼亚的客户回家考虑购买之前她会跟客户说：你要买的这辆车对你来说简直完美但几年之后当你的孩子离开家当你有稍多的储蓄另一台车就更适合了但是你现在来买这辆很不错随后 大部分马尼亚的客户第二天回来都会买另外那辆车那辆他们不需要的而且花费太多的车之后 由于马尼亚在汽车销售方面的成功她转行去卖飞机了（笑声）她丰富的人类心理学知识更让她很好地适应了现在的工作她现在是一名心理分析学家
en:Now, the ideology of choice is very successfulin opening for us a space to thinkabout some imagined future.Let me give you an example.My friend Manya,when she was a student at university in California,was earning moneyby working for a car dealer.Now, Manya, when she encounteredthe typical customer, would debate with himabout his lifestyle,how much he wants to spend,how many children he has,what does he need the car for?They would usually come to a good conclusionwhat would be a perfect car.Now, before Manya&#39;s customer would go homeand think things through,she would say to him,&quot;The car that you are buying now is perfect,but in a few year&#39;s time,when your kids will be already out of the house,when you will have a little bit more money,that other car will be ideal.But what you are buying now is great.&quot;Now, the majority of Manya&#39;s customerswho came back the next daybought that other car,the car they did not need,the car that cost far too much money.Now, Manya became so successful in selling carsthat soon she moved on to selling airplanes.(Laughter)And knowing so much aboutthe psychology of peopleprepared her well for her current job,which is that of a psychoanalyst.

zh-cn:为什么马尼亚的客户都如此不理性？马尼亚 的成功在于她能釋放客户的想象去构想一个理想的未来想象一个客户们变得更加成功 更加自由的未来而对客户们来说 选择更贵的那辆车似乎就让他们更接近自己的理想未来那个似乎已经被马尼亚看穿的未来
en:Now, why were Manya&#39;s customers so irrational?Manya&#39;s success was that she was ableto open in their heads an imageof an idealized future,an image of themselveswhen they are already more successful, freer,and for them, choosing that other carwas as if they are coming closer to this idealin which it was as if Manya already saw them.

zh-cn:其实 我们很少作出完全理性的选择选择被我们的潜意识被我们的社区所影响通常我们选择的方式是猜测他人对自己选择的看法同时 我们还会观察其他人选择什么抑或考虑社会接受哪个选择正因如此即便我们已经选好了譬如说买哪辆车实际上还是会不断地查看汽车评论就好像我们在说服自己选对了的感觉
en:Now, we rarely make really totally rational choices.Choices are influenced by our unconscious,by our community.We&#39;re often choosingby guessing, what would other peoplethink about our choice?Also we are choosingby looking at what others are choosing.We&#39;re also guessing what issocially acceptable choice.Now, because of this, we actuallyeven after we have already chosen,like bought a car,endlessly read reviews about cars,as if we still want to convince ourselvesthat we made the right choice.

zh-cn:抉择会引起焦虑并与风险 损失相关联而且极为不可预测因此人们现在有越来越多的问题以至于他们不敢作出任何选择不久以前 我在一个婚礼接待上遇到了一位年轻 漂亮的女士她迫不及待地开始跟我说她的选择焦虑症她对我说：我用了整整一个月来决定穿哪条裙子然后她说：我还用了几个星期搜索今晚该住哪间宾馆现在 我要选个精子捐献者（笑声）我惊讶地看着她“精子捐献者？那么急干什么？”她说：今年年底我就要40岁了而我完全不会选择人生伴侣
en:Now, choices are anxiety-provoking.They are linked to risks, losses.They are highly unpredictable.Now, because of this,people have now more and more problemsthat they are not choosing anything.Not long ago, I was at a wedding reception,and I met a young, beautiful womanwho immediately started tellingme about her anxiety over choice.She said to me, &quot;I needed one monthto decide which dress to wear.&quot;Then she said, &quot;For weeks I was researchingwhich hotel to stay for this one night.And now, I need to choose a sperm donor.&quot;(Laughter)I looked at this woman in shock.&quot;Sperm donor? What&#39;s the rush?&quot;She said, &quot;I&#39;m turning 40 at the end of this year,and I&#39;ve been so bad in choosing men in my life.&quot;

zh-cn:由于选择与风险相关联所以它还会带来焦虑曾经 著名的丹麦哲学家索伦·奥贝·基尔克果指出焦虑与“可能性”的出现有关现在我们认为自己能预防风险的发生因为我们有无穷无尽的市场分析和未来收入推测即使在市场这个充满可能性和随机性的地方里 我们仍旧认为自己能理性预测将会发生什么事
en:Now choice, because it&#39;s linked to risk,is anxiety-provoking,and it was already the famousDanish philosopher Søren Kierkegaardwho pointed out that anxietyis linked to the possibility of possibility.Now, we think today that we can prevent these risks.We have endless market analysis,projections of the future earnings.Even with market, which is about chance,randomness, we think we can predict rationallywhere it&#39;s going.

zh-cn:现在 机会其实正变得十分让人痛苦上一年 我的朋友伯纳德· 哈考特身处芝加哥大学 他组织了一场有关机会的会议我和他一起在讨论小组上就在我们递交论文的前一刻——同时又不知道对方论文内容时——我们决定严肃对待这个“机会”所以我们就告知观众接下来他们将听到的会是乱序的论文两份论文会混在一起但我们（两位作者）仍不知道对方的论文内容当天我们就真的如此进行那场会议伯纳德读了他的第一段我接着读我的第一段伯纳德 读第二段我接着读第二段就这样一直到论文结束你可能会讶异因为当时大部分观众并不认为他们听到的完全是乱序的文章他们不相信像我们俩这样来自权威机构的专业教授会严肃地对待这次“机会”他们认为我们一起准备了这些论文只是开玩笑说这些语段是乱序的
en:Now, chance is actually becoming very traumatic.Last year, my friend Bernard Harcourtat the University of Chicago organized an event,a conference on the idea of chance.He and I were together on the panel,and just before delivering our papers —we didn&#39;t know each other&#39;s papers —we decided to take chance seriously.So we informed our audiencethat what they will just now hearwill be a random paper,a mixture of the two paperswhich we didn&#39;t know what each was writing.Now, we delivered the conference in such a way.Bernard read his first paragraph,I read my first paragraph,Bernard read his second paragraph,I read my second paragraph,in this way towards the end of our papers.Now, you will be surprisedthat a majority of our audiencedid not think that what they&#39;d just listened towas a completely random paper.They couldn&#39;t believe thatspeaking from the position of authoritylike two professors we were,we would take chance seriously.They thought we prepared the papers togetherand were just joking that it&#39;s random.

zh-cn:如今 我们生活在信息爆炸的时代大数据时代有很多关于我们身体内部的科学知识我们解码了自己的基因组我们比以前更了解大脑但令人惊奇的是 人们却越来越对这种知识视而不见无知和否认不断增加面对当前的经济危机我们以为只要能再次醒来一切都会如初也就不需要政治 社会改革面对生态危机我们也认为目前不需做任何事或者其他人会更先采取行动甚至当生态危机已迫在眉睫就像福岛核泄漏事件对于生活在同一个环境里并收到相同信息的人之中有一半人会担心辐射而另一半会视而不见
en:Now, we live in times with a lot of information,big data,a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies.We decoded our genome.We know about our brains more than before.But surprisingly, people are more and moreturning a blind eye in front of this knowledge.Ignorance and denial are on the rise.Now, in regard to the current economic crisis,we think that we will just wake up againand everything will be the same as before,and no political or social changes are needed.In regard to ecological crisis,we think nothing needs to be done just now,or others need to act before us.Or even when ecological crisis already happens,like a catastrophe in Fukushima,often we have people living in the same environmentwith the same amount of information,and half of them will be anxious about radiationand half of them will ignore it.

zh-cn:心理分析学家很清楚地认识到人们出奇地追崇之物并非知识而是无知什么意思呢？假设我们患有一种危及生命的疾病很多人不愿意知道自己得病他们宁愿否认自己患病这也是为什么 病人不问我们就不说是明智之举出奇的是 研究表明 有时候否认自身疾病的患者比理性接受最佳治疗的患者要长寿
en:Now, psychoanalysts know very wellthat people surprisingly don&#39;t havepassion for knowledgebut passion for ignorance.Now, what does that mean?Let&#39;s say when we are facinga life-threatening illness,a lot of people don&#39;t want to know that.They&#39;d rather prefer denying the illness,which is why it&#39;s not so wise to inform themif they don&#39;t ask.Surprisingly, research shows that sometimespeople who deny their illnesslive longer than those who are rationally choosingthe best treatment.

zh-cn:可是 这种无知在社会水平却不是如此有助当我们不清楚前进的方向时就会带来一系列的社会损害
en:Now, this ignorance, however,is not very helpful on the level of the social.When we are ignorant about where we are heading,a lot of social damage can be caused.
时间：10:09
zh-cn:除了无知目前我们还面对一种“显而易见”的意识形态法国哲学家路易·阿尔都塞曾指出意识形态能够产生一种“显而易见”的面纱在作出任何社会批判之前我们必须揭开那层面纱并从稍微不同的角度思考倘若我们回到这种意识形态上这种我们经常追崇的个人的 理性的选择上就必定要在此揭开“显见”并改变思考角度
en:Now, on top of facing ignorance,we are also facing todaysome kind of an obviousness.Now, it was French philosopherLouis Althusser who pointed outthat ideology functions in such a waythat it creates a veil of obviousness.Before we do any social critique,it is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousnessand to think through a little bit differently.If we go back to this ideologyof individual, rational choicewe often embrace,it&#39;s necessary precisely hereto lift this obviousnessand to think a little bit differently.
时间：10:53
zh-cn:对我来说 我心里往往有一个问题为什么我们仍旧推崇这种自我造就的思想这种起源于资本主义的思想？为什么我们认为自己真的是自己人生的理性主宰者能够做出最理想的选择而且不接受损失和风险？我很震惊 有时候看到一些很穷的人打个比方说 不认同富有的人应该多缴税他们还经常性地带有中彩票的心态好吧 他们或许会认为自己在未来不会成功 但也许他们会想我的儿子可能会成为下一个比尔·盖茨啊谁会愿意自己的儿子被征税啊？或者 我的另一个问题是为什么没有健康保险的人不追崇全民医疗保险？有时候他们不追崇这方案的原因是鉴于对选择思考的不同可是他们没得选了啊？
en:Now for me, a question often iswhy we still embrace this idea of a self-made manon which capitalism relied from its beginning?Why do we think that we are really such mastersof our lives that we can rationallymake the best ideal choices,that we don&#39;t accept losses and risks?And for me, it&#39;s very shocking tosee sometimes very poor people,for example, not supporting the ideaof the rich being taxed more.Quite often here they still identifywith a certain kind of a lottery mentality.Okay, maybe they don&#39;t think that they will make itin the future, but maybe they think,my son might become the next Bill Gates.And who would want to tax one&#39;s son?Or, a question for me is also,why would people who have no health insurancenot embrace universal healthcare?Sometimes they don&#39;t embrace it,again identifying with the idea of choice,but they have nothing to choose from.

zh-cn:玛格丽特·撒切尔的一句名言是没有真正的“社会”所谓的“社会”并不存在 有的只是个人和家庭可悲的是 这种意识已经运作良好这就是为什么穷人会因为其贫穷而感到羞愧我们会不断地内疚 认为自己没有作出正确的选择所以自己没有成功我们总担心自己不够好正因如此 我们十分卖力地工作把长时间花在工作地点花在重塑自我之上当我们过于焦虑自身选择有时候我们很容易就丧失了选择权我们盲从着一些大师让他们告诉自己该做什么或需求自助治疗師或追逐一个看上去对抉择毫不迟疑的 全知的极权主义领导者
en:Now, Margaret Thatcher famously saidthat there is nothing like a society.Society doesn&#39;t exist, it is only individualsand their families.Sadly, this ideology still functions very well,which is why people who are poor might feelashamed for their poverty.We might endlessly feel guilty that we arenot making the right choices,and that&#39;s why we didn&#39;t succeed.We are anxious that we are not good enough.That&#39;s why we work very hard,long hours at the workplaceand equally long hours on remaking ourselves.Now, when we are anxious over choices,sometimes we easily give our power of choice away.We identify with the guruwho tells us what to do,self-help therapist,or we embrace a totalitarian leaderwho appears to have no doubts about choices,who sort of knows.

zh-cn:人们总会问我：通过钻研抉择你选到了什么？我学到了一条十分重要的信息当思考抉择时我个人不会对选择过于看重首先 我意识到自己很多决定都并非理性我的决定和我的潜意识相连我会猜测他人的选择或者社会的选择我同时推崇我们应该越过对个人抉择本身的思考而重新思考社会选择 这一点很重要因为这种个人抉择的意识使我们释然阻碍了我们去考虑社会变革我们花了太多时间为自我选择很少仔细考虑我们能作出的公共选择
en:Now, often people ask me,&quot;What did you learn by studying choice?&quot;And there is an important message that I did learn.When thinking about choices,I stopped taking choices too seriously, personally.First, I realized a lot of choice I makeis not rational.It&#39;s linked to my unconscious,my guesses of what others are choosing,or what is a socially embraced choice.I also embrace the ideathat we should go beyondthinking about individual choices,that it&#39;s very important to rethink social choices,since this ideology of individualchoice has pacified us.It really prevented us to think about social change.We spend so much timechoosing things for ourselvesand barely reflect oncommunal choices we can make.
时间：13:48
zh-cn:我们不应该忘记选择总是与改变相关联的我们能作出个人改变但更能带来社会变革我们可以选择有更多的狼我们可以选择改变我们的环境有更多的蜜蜂我们可以选择不一样的评级机构我们可以选择控制企业而不是让企业控制我们我们有这么一个机会去改变
en:Now, we should not forget that choiceis always linked to change.We can make individual changes,but we can make social changes.We can choose to have more wolves.We can choose to change our environmentto have more bees.We can choose to have different rating agencies.We can choose to control corporationsinstead of allowing corporations to control us.We have a possibility to make changes.

zh-cn:一开始 我引用了塞缪尔·约翰逊的话他说 当我们在人生中抉择时不应该忘了要生活最终 你可以看到我做出了决定选了演讲开始时三句名言中的一句我做出了自己的选择而作为国家 作为人民我们也有自己的选择 来重新思考在未来 我们想在怎么样的一个社会中生活
en:Now, I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson,who said that when we make choice in life,we shouldn&#39;t forget to live.Finally, you can seeI did have a choiceto choose one of the three quoteswith which I wanted to start my lecture.I did have a choice,such as nations, as people,we have choices too to rethinkin what kind of society we want to live in the future.
