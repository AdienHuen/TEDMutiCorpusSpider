zh-cn:今天的主题是“感觉情结”追求幸福与人性化设计我把有点严肃的达尔文放在上面不过旁边还有一只乐呵呵的黑猩猩我要说的第一点是 对幸福的追求是一种义务人渴求幸福 只会渴求幸福而不会拒绝幸福我们热切地向往幸福不仅希望享受幸福 而且想要越来越幸福
en:This is called Hooked on a Feeling:The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design.I put up a somewhat dour Darwin,but a very happy chimp up there.My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.Man wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy,and cannot wish not to be so.We are wired to pursue happiness,not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it.

zh-cn:如果这是真的那么我们在堆砌幸福上有多在行呢当然 我们很努力如果你上亚马逊网看 上面有超过2000个标题关于七个习惯 九个选择十个秘诀14000个幸福的建议我们现在又有了一个增加幸福的新招那就是给自己灌药现在有超过1亿2千万抗抑郁的处方药百忧解就是第一种非常受欢迎的药物它很干净 有效 没有兴奋作用没有危险 没有贩卖价值1995年非法药物买卖达到了4000亿美元相当于世界贸易的8%几乎与油汽相当
en:So given that that&#39;s true,how good are we at increasing our happiness?Well, we certainly try.If you look on the Amazon site, there are over 2,000 titleswith advice on the seven habits, the nine choices,the 10 secrets,the 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness.Now another way we try to increase our happinessis we medicate ourselves.And so there&#39;s over 120 million prescriptions out there for antidepressants.Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug.It was clean, efficient, there was no high,there was really no danger, it had no street value.In 1995,illegal drugs were a $400 billion business,representing eight percent of world trade,roughly the same as gas and oil.

zh-cn:这些通往幸福的路线似乎并未让幸福增加多少其中一个问题是一方面幸福增加的比率不尽如人意而另一方面 抑郁与不安的比率正在上升有人说这是因为我们的医术更加高明了所以更多的病例被诊断出来其实不然 我们是从整个世界来看的现在在美国自杀的要多于他杀在中国 自杀案件骤增世界卫生组织预测到了2020年抑郁会成为残疾的第二大至因
en:These routes to happiness haven&#39;t really increased happiness very much.One problem that&#39;s happening now is,although the rates of happinessare about as flat as the surface of the moon,depression and anxiety are rising.Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis,and more people are being found out.It isn&#39;t just that. We&#39;re seeing it all over the world.In the United States right nowthere are more suicides than homicides.There is a rash of suicide in China.And the World Health Organization predictsby the year 2020that depression will bethe second largest cause of disability.

zh-cn:所幸的是如何你在全世界做问卷调查你会发现四分之三的人会说他们挺幸福的但是这并不是主流比如说 这两幅图显示 在收入的大幅增加的情况下幸福曲线仍然平缓
en:Now the good news hereis that if you take surveys from around the world,we see that about three quarters of peoplewill say they are at least pretty happy.But this does not follow any of the usual trends.For example, these two show great growth in income,absolutely flat happiness curves.

zh-cn:我这一行 也就是心理学在了解人类幸福这一方们并没有做出很大的贡献我们有弗洛伊德的遗产 他是个悲观主义者他说对幸福的追求最终必定失败它源于个人幼稚的各个方面而永远不会实现他说：“人不情愿承认人类追求幸福的意图并不在神创人的计划中。”因此 心理分析治疗的终极目标实际上就是弗洛伊德所谓的&quot;自讨苦吃&quot;
en:My field, the field of psychology,hasn&#39;t done a whole lotto help us move forward in understanding human happiness.In part, we have the legacy of Freud, who was a pessimist,who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest,is propelled by infantile aspects of the individualthat can never be met in reality.He said, &quot;One feels inclined to saythat the intention that man should be happyis not included in the plan of creation.&quot;So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapywas really what Freud called ordinary misery.

zh-cn:弗洛伊德部分反映了人类情绪系统的剖析我们有一个积极的和一个消极的系统而我们消极的系统非常敏感比如说 我们天生就爱吃甜食而特别厌恶苦的味道还有人对失去的厌恶感要强于他们得到时的幸福感幸福婚姻的方程式是五个积极互动才抵得过一个消极互动一个消极互动就是这么厉害尤其是轻视或厌恶的表示你必须用一大堆的积极情绪才能抵消
en:And Freud in part reflectsthe anatomy of the human emotion system —which is that we have both a positive and a negative system,and our negative systemis extremely sensitive.So for example, we&#39;re born loving the taste of something sweetand reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter.We also find that people are more averse to losingthan they are happy to gain.The formula for a happy marriageis five positive remarks, or interactions,for every one negative.And that&#39;s how powerful the one negative is.Especially expressions of contempt or disgust,well you really need a lot of positives to upset that.

zh-cn:我还把压力反应加上去了我们天生就对直接的物理的 切近的危险我们的身体会发生不可思议反应产生内源性阿片类物质我们身体的系统自古以来就是如此专门为防备身体伤害经过漫长的时间 这成为了一种压力反应对身体产生巨大影响皮质醇充斥大脑摧毁海马神经细胞和记忆能够引起各种健康问题
en:I also put in here the stress response.We&#39;re wired for dangers that are immediate,that are physical, that are imminent,and so our body goes into an incredible reactionwhere endogenous opioids come in.We have a system that is really ancient,and really there for physical danger.And so over time, this becomes a stress response,which has enormous effects on the body.Cortisol floods the brain;it destroys hippocampal cells and memory,and can lead to all kinds of health problems.

zh-cn:然而 在某种程度上 我们需要这个系统如果我们只受愉悦支配那么我们是活不下去的我们实际上是由两方面控制的情绪对挑战和机遇的短期强烈反应每个反应都让我们做自我调整将思想 观念 感觉 记忆放大 打开 关闭我们总以为情绪就是感觉但其实 情绪是所有系统的警报改变我们的记忆所做的决定以及对事物的看法
en:But unfortunately, we need this system in part.If we were only governed by pleasurewe would not survive.We really have two command posts.Emotions are short-lived intense responsesto challenge and to opportunity.And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selvesthat tune in, turn on, drop outthoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories.We tend to think of emotions as just feelings.But in fact, emotions are an all-systems alertthat change what we remember,what kind of decisions we make,and how we perceive things.

zh-cn:下面我转到关于幸福的新科学我们从弗洛伊德的悲观中走出来现在人们开始积极地做这项研究关于幸福的科学 其中关键的一点是幸福与不幸福并不是一个连续统一体的两端弗洛伊德模式是一个连续统一体那就是你的烦恼越少你就越开心但事实并非如此 你的烦恼少了你只是没那么不开心了而幸福在等式另一端幸福缺失了 从心理治疗中缺失了因而 当人们的症状消失了 又复返了这是因为另一半缺失了那就是愉悦 幸福 同情心 感激之情这些积极的情绪直觉告诉我们幸福并不意味着没有烦恼但是 直到最近人们才把两者作为平行系统看待这样身体才能一边寻找机遇一边保护自己这两者是互补并活跃互动的系统
en:So let me go forward to the new science of happiness.We&#39;ve come away from the Freudian gloom,and people are now actively studying this.And one of the key points in the science of happinessis that happiness and unhappinessare not endpoints of a single continuum.The Freudian model is really one continuumthat, as you get less miserable,you get happier.And that isn&#39;t true — when you get less miserable,you get less miserable.And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.And it&#39;s been missing. It&#39;s been missing from psychotherapy.So when people&#39;s symptoms go away, they tend to recur,because there isn&#39;t a sense of the other half —of what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude,what are the positive emotions.And of course we know this intuitively,that happiness is not just the absence of misery.But somehow it was not put forward until very recently,seeing these as two parallel systems.So that the body can both look for opportunityand also protect itself from danger, at the same time.And they&#39;re sort of two reciprocaland dynamically interacting systems.

zh-cn:人们也想过解析幸福我们用“幸福”这个词这是一个概念的一把大伞伞下是三种情绪 都是非英文单词fiero 是指战胜了挑战后的骄傲schadenfreude 是指建立在他人痛苦之上的幸福不怀好意的愉悦naches 对自己孩子抱有的骄傲与喜悦不管是这上面还是任何关于幸福的探讨都没有谈到对他人所抱有的幸福感我们似乎找不到一个词来表达我们对消极事物非常敏感而这由于我们拥有积极感而被抵消了
en:People have also wanted to deconstruct.We use this word &quot;happy,&quot;and it&#39;s this very large umbrella of a term.And then three emotions for which there are no English words:fiero, which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge;schadenfreude, which is happiness in another&#39;s misfortune,a malicious pleasure;and naches, which is a pride and joy in one&#39;s children.Absent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness,are happiness in another&#39;s happiness.We don&#39;t seem to have a word for that.We are very sensitive to the negative,but it is in part offset by the factthat we have a positivity.

zh-cn:我们天生就会寻求愉悦感婴儿喜欢甜味而讨厌苦味他们喜欢平滑的表面而不是粗糙的表面他们喜欢看漂亮的脸蛋而非平庸的脸蛋他们喜欢听和谐的旋律而非不和谐的旋律婴儿有许多与生俱来的内在快感一位心理学家曾说对幸福80%的追求都由基因决定变得幸福跟长高一样难一派胡言基因对幸福是有一定的影响大概占50%但另外50%就与基因无关了
en:We&#39;re also born pleasure-seekers.Babies love the taste of sweetand hate the taste of bitter.They love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones.They like to look at beautiful facesrather than plain faces.They like to listen to consonant melodiesinstead of dissonant melodies.Babies really are bornwith a lot of innate pleasures.There was once a statement made by a psychologistthat said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happinessis really just about the genes,and it&#39;s as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller.That&#39;s nonsense.There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes —about 50 percent —but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for.

zh-cn:我们来看看大脑内部看看幸福感是从进化的哪一阶段出现的这里至少有两个系统都非常古老一个是犒赏系统分泌出多巴胺从腹侧被盖区域开始进入伏隔核一直到达前额叶皮质 眶额叶皮质这里是做决定的地方 高级别这原本被看做是大脑的快感系统在二十世纪50年代奥德斯和米尔纳将电极植入一只老鼠的大脑结果这只老鼠不停地按那根铁杆成千上万次它不吃不睡不交配它一直在按那个铁杆他们以为这肯定是大脑的兴奋诱导器
en:Let&#39;s just go into the brain for a moment,and see where does happinessarise from in evolution.We have basically at least two systems here,and they both are very ancient.One is the reward system,and that&#39;s fed by the chemical dopamine.And it starts in the ventral tegmental area.It goes to the nucleus accumbens,all the way up to the prefrontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex,where decisions are made, high level.This was originally seen as a systemthat was the pleasure system of the brain.In the 1950s,Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat.And the rat would just keep pressing that barthousands and thousands and thousands of times.It wouldn&#39;t eat. It wouldn&#39;t sleep. It wouldn&#39;t have sex.It wouldn&#39;t do anything but press this bar.So they assumedthis must be, you know, the brain&#39;s orgasmatron.

zh-cn:结果发现 事实并非如此这其实是一个激励系统一个渴求系统产生一种兴奋作用让事物看起来非常诱人使你不得不去追求它这跟快感系统有区别快感系统是：“我喜欢。”你可以看到 快感系统是体内的兴奋剂大脑中遍布着一种催产素多巴胺系统 也就是渴求系统则更为集中
en:It turned out that it wasn&#39;t,that it really is a system of motivation,a system of wanting.It gives objects what&#39;s called incentive salience.It makes something look so attractivethat you just have to go after it.That&#39;s something differentfrom the system that is the pleasure system,which simply says, &quot;I like this.&quot;The pleasure system, as you see,which is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin,is widely spread throughout the brain.Dopamine system, the wanting system,is much more centralized.

zh-cn:积极情绪的另一个特点是具有同样的信号我们看这微笑这个信号并不只是嘴角上扬至颧骨它还包括外眼角即眼轮匝肌眯起即使是十个月大的婴儿 当看到妈妈时都会露出这样的微笑性格外向的人比内向的人笑得更开人们在压抑的情绪释放之后比在此之前笑得更开怀如果你想判断一个人是否真的开心看这个表情就知道了
en:The other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal.And we see here the smile.And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lipsto the zygomatic major.It&#39;s also crinkling the outer corner of the eye,the orbicularis oculi.So you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother,will show this particular kind of smile.Extroverts use it more than introverts.People who are relieved of depressionshow it more after than before.So if you want to unmask a true look of happiness,you will look for this expression.

zh-cn:人的快感有着很长的历史许多快感是习得的但也有许多是最基本的 其中一个就是我们对自然界做出反应的自卫本能这非常重要一些研究非常有意思关于人们接受外科手术后的恢复情况对象为面对砖墙的人和面向树木和自然的人那些面对砖墙的人住院的时间更长 需要更多药物并且出现更多并发症大自然拥有非常强大的恢复力量它对我们的恢复发挥一定的作用
en:Our pleasures are really ancient.And we learn, of course, many, many pleasures,but many of them are base. And one of them, of course, is biophilia —that we have a response to the natural worldthat&#39;s very profound.Very interesting studiesdone on people recovering from surgery,who found that people who faced a brick wallversus people who looked out on trees and nature,the people who looked out on the brick wallwere in the hospital longer, needed more medication,and had more medical complications.There is something very restorative about nature,and it&#39;s part of how we are tuned.

zh-cn:人类尤为如此 我们是善于模仿的造物我们几乎从一出生就开始模仿了这是个三周大的婴儿如果你向他伸出舌头他会学你我们自出世就是社会性的人关于合作的研究也显示人与人之间的合作点亮大脑的犒赏中心心理学的一个问题在于没有关注这一主体间性或社会性头脑对于初生于世 孤立无援需要彼此的人类的重要性而关注的是自身自尊心 而不是人与人之间的关系强调“我”而不是“我们”我认为这是个很严重的问题违背了我们的生理和本质并没有让我们变得更幸福
en:Humans, particularly so, we&#39;re very imitative creatures.And we imitate from almost the second we are born.Here is a three-week-old baby.And if you stick your tongue out at this baby,the baby will do the same.We are social beings from the beginning.And even studies of cooperationshow that cooperation between individualslights up reward centers of the brain.One problem that psychology has hadis instead of looking at this intersubjectivity —or the importance of the social brainto humans who come into the world helplessand need each other tremendously —is that they focus instead on the selfand self-esteem, and not self-other.It&#39;s sort of &quot;me,&quot; not &quot;we.&quot;And I think this has been a really tremendous problemthat goes against our biology and nature,and hasn&#39;t made us any happier at all.

zh-cn:人们最开心的时候是当他们处于心流之中醉心于外界的某项活动中与别人相处 身体动起来做运动 专情于某人学习 性生活 等等他们并不是坐在镜子前分析自己或者琢磨自己这可不是你最快乐的时候还有一点 有证据显示在自杀者的计算机文本分析中你会发现一些有意思的现象里面有许多第一人称单数的用法“我” “我的”而不是“我们”这些信中更多地表达的是孤独而不是绝望孤独对人类来说是非常不自然的有归属是一种关键的需要
en:Because when you think about it, people are happiest when in flow,when they&#39;re absorbed in something out in the world,when they&#39;re with other people, when they&#39;re active,engaged in sports, focusing on a loved one,learning, having sex, whatever.They&#39;re not sitting in front of the mirrortrying to figure themselves out,or thinking about themselves.These are not the periods when you feel happiest.The other thing is, that a piece of evidence is,is if you look at computerized text analysisof people who commit suicide,what you find there, and it&#39;s quite interesting,is use of the first person singular —&quot;I,&quot; &quot;me,&quot; &quot;my,&quot;not &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; —and the letters are less hopelessthan they are really alone.And being alone is very unnatural to the human.There is a profound need to belong.

zh-cn:然而 进化史有许多容易误导人的地方例如 基因并不关心我们快乐与否只关心我们复制把基因传给后代我们有这样三个系统是生殖的基础 因为这非常重要一个是性欲 也就是对性的渴望这受性激素的调节吸引这属于欲望系统分泌多巴胺 也就是“我必须得到这个人。”还有依恋 也就是催产素也就是“这是一段长期的关系。”问题是 对于人类而言 这三者可以分开也就是说 一个人可以处于一段长期关系中同时喜欢上另一个人并想要与第三个人发生性关系
en:But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up.Because, for example, the genes don&#39;t care whether we&#39;re happy,they care that we replicate,that we pass our genes on.So for example we have three systemsthat underlie reproduction, because it&#39;s so important.There&#39;s lust, which is just wanting to have sex.And that&#39;s really mediated by the sex hormones.Romantic attraction,that gets into the desire system.And that&#39;s dopamine-fed. And that&#39;s, &quot;I must have this one person.&quot;There&#39;s attachment, which is oxytocin,and the opiates, which says, &quot;This is a long-term bond.&quot;See the problem is that, as humans, these three can separate.So a person can be in a long term attachment,become romantically infatuated with someone else,and want to have sex with a third person.

zh-cn:基因还可以通过社会地位对我们产生误导我们对社会地位高度关注总在寻求提高社会地位在动物世界里 只有一种方法能够提高地位那就是胜者为王身强力壮就能掌握权力通过捶胸来巩固权力而你做出服从的姿态而人类往上爬的方式则截然不同是名声可以自由授予一个人有专长和知识 有才干我们就给这个人地位这样我们就创造了更多社会角色人们也就不会像动物世界那样处于社会等级中处于下层了
en:The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astrayis in social status.We are very acutely aware of our social statusand always seek to further and increase it.Now in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status,and that&#39;s dominance.I seize command by physical prowess,and I keep it by beating my chest,and you make submissive gestures.Now, the human has a whole other way to rise to the top,and that is a prestige route,which is freely conferred.Someone has expertise and knowledge, and knows how to do things,and we give that person status.And that&#39;s clearly the way for us to create many more niches of statusso that people don&#39;t have to be lower on the status hierarchyas they are in the animal world.

zh-cn:数据显示 金钱并不能购买幸福但是金钱与幸福还是有关系的看看这些问题 生活满足感生活满足感随收入的增长而增加精神抑郁随收入的降低而增加显然 金钱还是有一点影响的但是这种影响较小关于金钱的另一个问题是拜金主义当人们过于热衷于金钱他们就会忽略生活中基本的快感这里有一对夫妇“那些相对穷的人是不是更享受性生活呢？”这个孩子在说：“别碰我的玩具。”所以 问题之一就是 拜金主义有些过头了这整个多巴胺－渴求系统占了主导并背离了整个快感系统
en:The data isn&#39;t terribly supportive of money buying happiness.But it&#39;s not irrelevant.So if you look at questions like this, life satisfaction,you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income.You see mental distress going up with lower income.So clearly there is some effect.But the effect is relatively small.And one of the problems with money is materialism.What happens when people pursue money too avidly,is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life.So we have here, this couple.&quot;Do you think the less-fortunate are having better sex?&quot;And then this kid over here is saying, &quot;Leave me alone with my toys.&quot;So one of the things is that it really takes over.That whole dopamine-wanting systemtakes over and derails from any of the pleasure system.

en:So to just quickly conclude with some brief datathat suggests this might be so.One is people who underwent what is called a quantum change:they felt their life and their whole values had changed.And sure enough, if you look at the kinds of values that come in,you see wealth, adventure, achievement, pleasure, fun, be respected,before the change,and much more post-materialist values after.Women had a whole different set of value shifts.But very similarly, the only one that survived there was happiness.They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-controlto generosity and forgiveness.
