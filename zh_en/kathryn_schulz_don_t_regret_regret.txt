zh-cn:这是强尼･德普 很显然这是他的肩膀这是他肩膀上著名的纹身也许有人知道90年代德普和薇诺娜･赖德订婚他的右肩上就有了这个纹身“永远的薇诺娜”然而3年后－这个依照好莱坞的标准来说算得上永远了－他俩各奔东西强尼一蹶不振 做了些小修纹现在他肩膀的纹身是“永远的酒鬼”
en:So that&#39;s Johnny Depp, of course.And that&#39;s Johnny Depp&#39;s shoulder.And that&#39;s Johnny Depp&#39;s famous shoulder tattoo.Some of you might know that, in 1990,Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder,and he had tattooed on his right shoulder&quot;Winona forever.&quot;And then three years later —which in fairness, kind of is forever by Hollywood standards —they broke up,and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done.And now his shoulder says, &quot;Wino forever.&quot;

zh-cn:我喜欢强尼･德普就像16岁到50岁美国人中的百分之二十五的人一样我有纹身大概是25岁左右的时候我开始想纹一个不过我刻意等了很久因为我知道很多人在17岁或者19岁23岁纹了身然后30岁就后悔了我不是这样的我29岁的时候去纹了身然后立马后悔了我说的“后悔”是我一出了纹身店的门－离这儿就几公里远在下东区－大白天好端端地我就在东百老汇和运河街的拐角情绪崩溃了（笑声）那是个情绪崩溃的好地方因为别人都懒得理你（笑声）那天晚上我回到家，情绪更加崩溃一会儿我会再谈谈
en:So like Johnny Depp,and like 25 percent of Americansbetween the ages of 16 and 50,I have a tattoo.I first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s,but I deliberately waited a really long time.Because we all know peoplewho have gotten tattoos when they were 17or 19 or 23and regretted it by the time they were 30.That didn&#39;t happen to me.I got my tattoo when I was 29,and I regretted it instantly.And by &quot;regretted it,&quot;I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place —this is just a couple miles from heredown on the Lower East Side —and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylighton the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street.(Laughter)Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares.(Laughter)And then I went home that night, and I had an even larger emotional meltdown,which I&#39;ll say more about in a minute.

zh-cn:这让我十分震惊因为在那之前我告诉自己我绝对不会后悔的我做过很多错事和傻事 这是当然的而且从来没间断过但我觉得我在当时的状况下基于手头具有的信息作出了最好的选择我学到了一些这就是我成为现在的我的原因我不会改变的也就是说我深知我们对后悔的文化也就是为过去的事情悲伤简直就是在浪费时间我们应该常常向前看而不是向后看我们最好应该做的事就是争取活在没有后悔的世界了
en:And this was all actually quite shocking to me,because prior to this moment,I had prided myselfon having absolutely no regrets.I made a lot of mistakesand dumb decisions, of course.I do that hourly.But I had always felt like, look, you know,I made the best choice I could makegiven who I was then,given the information I had on hand.I learned a lesson from it.It somehow got me to where I am in life right now.And okay, I wouldn&#39;t change it.In other words, I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret,which is that lamenting things that occurred in the pastis an absolute waste of time,that we should always look forward and not backward,and that one of the noblest and best things we can dois strive to live a life free of regrets.

zh-cn:有句话很好地表达了这个观点：“放开无法挽回的事情泼出去水收不回来”首先这个看起来是很值得赞扬的人生哲学－要是我不告诉你谁说的大家也许会同意然后签署为...没错就是麦克白夫人告诉她丈夫别像个懦夫一样害怕杀了人这里莎士比亚其实另有所指他总是这样因为无法体会后悔其实是反社会人格的诊断特征之一它也是一种脑损伤的表象如果有人的眼窝前额皮质受到损失就可能在甚至面对非常错误的决定时也能绝不后悔那么你要是想生而无悔那就有个办法叫前脑叶白质切除术但是如果你想正常功能做正常人有人性那就得学着不要一悔再悔
en:This idea is nicely captured by this quote:&quot;Things without all remedyshould be without regard;what&#39;s done is done.&quot;And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first —something we might all agree to sign onto ...until I tell you who said it.Right, so this is Lady MacBethbasically telling her husband to stop being such a wussfor feeling bad about murdering people.And as it happens, Shakespeare was onto something here,as he generally was.Because the inability to experience regretis actually one of the diagnostic characteristicsof sociopaths.It&#39;s also, by the way, a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage.So people who have damageto their orbital frontal cortexseem to be unable to feel regretin the face of even obviously very poor decisions.So if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret,there is an option open to you.It&#39;s called a lobotomy.But if you want to be fully functionaland fully humanand fully humane,I think you need to learn to live, not without regret, but with it.

zh-cn:首先让我们定义一下几个词语什么是后悔？后悔是我们觉得如果过去做法不同当下的状况就会更好更幸福时的情绪表达也就是 后悔包含两点首先是对象－我们曾经作出个决定第二是想像我们要想像如果能回到过去，作出不同的选择那么我们就能据此想像未来眼下的事情会如何发展这两样我们有的越多－在一个遗憾上有更多的对象和想像这种后悔就越强烈
en:So let&#39;s start off by defining some terms.What is regret?Regret is the emotion we experiencewhen we think that our present situationcould be better or happierif we had done something different in the past.So in other words, regret requires two things.It requires, first of all, agency — we had to make a decision in the first place.And second of all, it requires imagination.We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice,and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forwardand imagine how things would be playing out in our present.And in fact, the more we have of either of these things —the more agency and the more imaginationwith respect to a given regret,the more acute that regret will be.

zh-cn:比如你在去你朋友婚礼的路上机场的路上塞车你最终到了登机口却错过飞机了如果你只是迟到了3分钟会比迟到20分钟后悔得更厉害为什么因为如果你只是迟到3分钟去想像你要是做个不同的决定事情就不会这样子是非常痛苦的“我应该不走隧道走大桥我不应该在那个黄灯停下来”这是典型会导致后悔的场景在觉得我们对一个决定负责而其结果糟糕但离好结果近在咫尺的时候我们就会觉得后悔
en:So let&#39;s say for instancethat you&#39;re on your way to your best friend&#39;s weddingand you&#39;re trying to get to the airport and you&#39;re stuck in terrible traffic,and you finally arrive at your gateand you&#39;ve missed your flight.You&#39;re going to experience more regret in that situationif you missed your flight by three minutesthan if you missed it by 20.Why?Well because, if you miss your flight by three minutes,it is painfully easy to imaginethat you could have made different decisionsthat would have led to a better outcome.&quot;I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel.I should have gone through that yellow light.&quot;These are the classic conditions that create regret.We feel regret when we think we are responsiblefor a decision that came out badly,but almost came out well.

zh-cn:在这个模式下我们显然常常后悔很多事情今天这个会议是关于行为经济学我们知道的大部分“后悔”都是来自这个范围我们对消费者的财政决定有大量研究他们的决定－也就是购买者的懊悔不过终于有研究者想到那么到底人生中我们最后悔什么？让我们看看结果
en:Now within that framework,we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things.This session today is about behavioral economics.And most of what we know about regretcomes to us out of that domain.We have a vast body of literatureon consumer and financial decisionsand the regrets associated with them —buyer&#39;s remorse, basically.But then finally, it occurred to some researchers to step backand say, well okay, but overall,what do we regret most in life?Here&#39;s what the answers turn out to look like.

zh-cn:六大遗憾－人生里我们最遗憾的事情：第一是教育百分之三十三的后悔是来自对受教育的决定我们希望受更多的教育更好地利用教育资源或者学习另外一个专业其他在遗憾单子上非常高排名的项目还有事业，爱情，子女教育各种各样的定义了今天我们自身的决定还有怎么度过闲暇时间的决定－或者确切地说后悔我们怎么没好好利用闲暇时间其他的遗憾还有这些：财政，家庭问题包括婚姻或子女教育健康，朋友精神世界和社区
en:So top six regrets —the things we regret most in life:Number one by far, education.33 percent of all of our regretspertain to decisions we made about education.We wish we&#39;d gotten more of it.We wish we&#39;d taken better advantage of the education that we did have.We wish we&#39;d chosen to study a different topic.Others very high on our list of regretsinclude career, romance, parenting,various decisions and choices about our sense of selfand how we spend our leisure time —or actually more specifically,how we fail to spend our leisure time.The remaining regretspertain to these things:finance, family issues unrelated to romance or parenting,health, friends,spirituality and community.

zh-cn:换句话说，我们是通过金融研究了解了遗憾但结果是当你思量人们生命中的憾事时我们的财务决定根本就是排不上号理财上的遗憾都不及总的遗憾的百分之三那么如果你因为不知道选个大帽子还是小帽子苦恼或者纠结于公司A和B斯巴鲁还是普瑞斯那么还是别操那个心了因为你五年之内都不会在意这个的
en:So in other words, we know most of what we know about regretby the study of finance.But it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life,you know what, our financial decisions don&#39;t even rank.They account for less than three percent of our total regrets.So if you&#39;re sitting there stressingabout large cap versus small cap,or company A versus company B,or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius,you know what, let it go.Odds are, you&#39;re not going to care in five years.

zh-cn:而对于我们真正在乎并且会深深抱有遗憾的事物会是什么样的感受？不用说我们都知道会无比地痛心后悔但结果显示懊悔主要由四个非常特有的，连贯性的阶段组成第一个就是否认当我那晚纹了身回家时我一夜没睡头几个小时我脑子里只有一个念头就是“我不要这样！”这是个令人难以置信的初始情绪就像是心里想着“我要妈妈！”根本不想解决问题不试着去了解问题的根由就是希望错误消失
en:But for these things that we actually do really care aboutand do experience profound regret around,what does that experience feel like?We all know the short answer.It feels terrible. Regret feels awful.But it turns out that regret feels awfulin four very specific and consistent ways.So the first consistent component of regretis basically denial.When I went home that night after getting my tattoo,I basically stayed up all night.And for the first several hours,there was exactly one thought in my head.And the thought was,&quot;Make it go away!&quot;This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response.I mean, it&#39;s right up there with, &quot;I want my mommy!&quot;We&#39;re not trying to solve the problem.We&#39;re not trying to understand how the problem came about.We just want it to vanish.
时间： 7:50
zh-cn:后悔第二波就是困惑感那天晚上我在卧室里想的就是“我怎么做出这样的事情？我到底在想什么？”这是尝试把做出后悔决定的那部分自己跟自身孤立起来我们无法认同那部分自己无法理解那部分而我们绝对不喜欢那部分自己－这就带来了后悔第三波一种强烈的自我惩罚的愿望这就是我们面对悔恨的时候总之自我责难：“真想抽自己一巴掌！”第四波就是心理学家所谓的表现执拗表现执拗就是不断地强迫性地重复同一件事情而表现执拗的结果就是持续不停地重复后悔的前三个阶段那天晚上我就坐在卧室里想“我不要这样！”我就这么坐着一直想“不要这样，不要这样不要这样，不要这样。”如果你查看心理学文献这些就是悔恨的四个阶段
en:The second characteristic component of regretis a sense of bewilderment.So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that nightwas, &quot;How could I have done that?What was I thinking?&quot;This real sense of alienationfrom the part of us that made a decision we regret.We can&#39;t identify with that part.We don&#39;t understand that part.And we certainly don&#39;t have any empathy for that part —which explains the third consistent component of regret,which is an intense desire to punish ourselves.That&#39;s why, in the face of our regret,the thing we consistently say is, &quot;I could have kicked myself.&quot;The fourth component hereis that regret is what psychologists call perseverative.To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedlyon the exact same thing.Now the effect of perseverationis to basically take these first three components of regretand put them on an infinite loop.So it&#39;s not that I sat there in my bedroom that night,thinking, &quot;Make it go away.&quot;It&#39;s that I sat there and I thought,&quot;Make it go away. Make it go away.Make it go away. Make it go away.&quot;So if you look at the psychological literature,these are the four consistent defining components of regret.

zh-cn:但我想说还有第五阶段我想这是一种自我觉醒那晚我在公寓里反反复复讨伐自己后我躺在床上很久想着植皮然后我想到旅行保险可不保自然灾害那么我的医疗保险自然也不包括自己干的蠢事没有什么保险保自己干的蠢事愚蠢的结果就是自己完全无保障你完全袒露在这个世界面前袒露在你自身的脆弱和不可谱面前事实上，这是个相对无情的世界
en:But I want to suggest that there&#39;s also a fifth one.And I think of thisas a kind of existential wake-up call.That night in my apartment,after I got done kicking myself and so forth,I lay in bed for a long time,and I thought about skin grafts.And then I thought about how,much as travel insurance doesn&#39;t cover acts of God,probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy.In point of fact, no insurance covers acts of idiocy.The whole point of acts of idiocyis that they leave you totally uninsured;they leave you exposed to the worldand exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibilityin face of, frankly, a fairly indifferent universe.

zh-cn:这很明显是个十分痛苦的经历我想这对于西方人来说这种Control-Z文化是无比痛苦的－Control-Z就是电脑键盘上的命令撤消在某种意义上 我们曾经不用去面对残酷的现实我们以为用钱或者科技就能解决问题－我们能撤消，能解除好友关系取消关注但问题是生活中有很多我们迫切地期望改变但是不行有时候不是撤消而是无法控制而对于那些控制狂和完美主义者－我知道我说自己呢－这是非常糟糕的因为我们想亲力亲为每件事并绝对做好
en:This is obviously an incredibly painful experience.And I think it&#39;s particularly painful for us now in the Westin the grips of what I sometimes think ofas a Control-Z culture —Control-Z like the computer command,undo.We&#39;re incredibly used to not having to facelife&#39;s hard realities, in a certain sense.We think we can throw money at the problemor throw technology at the problem —we can undo and unfriendand unfollow.And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in lifethat we desperately want to changeand we cannot.Sometimes instead of Control-Z,we actually have zero control.And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists —and I know where of I speak —this is really hard,because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right.
时间：10:38
zh-cn:那么有一点就是控制狂和完美主义者千万别纹身一会儿我会提到这一点首先是我们体验到的懊悔各阶段的强度和持久度很显然是取决于后悔的特定对象比如这就是一个常常导致我后悔的例子（笑声）文字：回复给所有人这个狡猾的技术发明的奇特之处就是仅仅是这样一个东西就足够让你无比后悔你可能不小心点了这个按钮然后断送了一段恋爱或者就是在办公室里羞愧地想钻地洞或者被炒鱿鱼
en:Now there is a case to be madethat control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos,and I&#39;m going to return to that point in a few minutes.But first I want to saythat the intensity and persistencewith which we experience these emotional components of regretis obviously going to varydepending on the specific thing that we&#39;re feeling regretful about.So for instance, here&#39;s one of my favoriteautomatic generators of regret in modern life.(Laughter)Text: Relpy to all.And the amazing thingabout this really insidious technological innovationis that even just with this one thing,we can experience a huge range of regret.You can accidentally hit &quot;reply all&quot; to an emailand torpedo a relationship.Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work.Or you can have your last day at work.
时间：11:31
zh-cn:这些比起真正的生命中的遗憾完全不算什么因为有时候我们的决定会导致无可挽回的结果也许是关于自己或者别人的健康幸福或者生活之类最严重的是涉及到别人的生命很显然那些遗憾会无比痛苦且持久甚至仅仅是愚蠢的“恢复给所有人”就能折磨我们好几天
en:And this doesn&#39;t even touchon the really profound regrets of a life.Because of course, sometimes we do make decisionsthat have irrevocable and terrible consequences,either for our own or for other people&#39;shealth and happiness and livelihoods,and in the very worst case scenario, even their lives.Now obviously, those kinds of regretsare incredibly piercing and enduring.I mean, even the stupid &quot;reply all&quot; regretscan leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days.
时间：12:06
zh-cn:那我们怎么才能面对悔恨？我想提三点建议来让我们平和地面对后悔第一就是意识到它的普遍性如果你在谷歌上搜索后悔和纹身能有1150万条结果（笑声）食品和药物管理局估计全美纹过身的人里大概有百分之十七的人都会后悔包括强尼･德普，我还有七百万陌生朋友而这只不过是后悔纹了身而已我们都差不多
en:So how are we supposed to live with this?I want to suggest that there&#39;s three thingsthat help us to make our peace with regret.And the first of theseis to take some comfort in its universality.If you Google regret and tattoo,you will get 11.5 million hits.(Laughter)The FDA estimatesthat of all the Americans who have tattoos,17 percent of us regret getting them.That is Johnny Depp and meand our seven million friends.And that&#39;s just regret about tattoos.We are all in this together.
时间：12:46
zh-cn:第二点去平和地处理后悔就是学会自嘲这对我来说一点都不难因为你要是29岁了还因为一个不喜欢的新纹身而哭着找妈妈的话完全可以自嘲一下虽然有人会觉得这个建议对于真正沉重的后悔来说有点残酷且华而不实我不这么认为几乎我们所有人都经历过十分痛苦和懊悔的情况幽默，甚至黑色幽默能帮助我们度过难关因为它能连接我们生活的两个极端正极和负极给我们的生活注入一点电流
en:The second way that we can help make our peace with regretis to laugh at ourselves.Now in my case, this really wasn&#39;t a problem,because it&#39;s actually very easy to laugh at yourselfwhen you&#39;re 29 years old and you want your mommybecause you don&#39;t like your new tattoo.But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestionwhen it comes to these more profound regrets.I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case though.All of us who&#39;ve experienced regretthat contains real pain and real griefunderstand that humor and even black humorplays a crucial role in helping us survive.It connects the poles of our lives back together,the positive and the negative,and it sends a little current of life back into us.
时间：13:32
zh-cn:第三点我想就是通过时间的流逝来慢慢平和地面对遗憾我想，时间抚平一切－除了纹身大概是永久性的我纹身也有几年了你们想看看吗？没问题不过我得先声明一下你们可能会失望因为这个纹身并不那么糟糕我可没把玛莉莲･曼森的脸纹到什么隐私部位别人看到我的纹身基本上都还挺喜欢只是我不喜欢这个图案正如我之前所说 我是个完美主义者不过我还是会给你们看看
en:The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regretis through the passage of time,which, as we know, heals all wounds —except for tattoos, which are permanent.So it&#39;s been several yearssince I got my own tattoo.And do you guys just want to see it?All right.Actually, you know what, I should warn you,you&#39;re going to be disappointed.Because it&#39;s actually not that hideous.I didn&#39;t tattoo Marilyn Manson&#39;s faceon some indiscreet part of myself or something.When other people see my tattoo,for the most part they like how it looks.It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t like how it looks.And as I said earlier, I&#39;m a perfectionist.But I&#39;ll let you see it anyway.
时间：14:25
zh-cn:我的纹身我知道你们有些人会怎么想那么让我告诉你有些你后悔的东西并不是你以为的那么糟糕我纹这个是因为我二十来岁的时候基本都是在其他国家旅行后来当我到纽约定居后我怕自己会忘记在那期间我认识到一些重要的东西特别有两点我最不想忘记一是不要停止探索的脚步二是不要忘记你心中的目标我当初喜欢这个指南针图案就是因为觉得这个图案将上述两点含括于内我想这个会变成我永久的记忆
en:This is my tattoo.I can guess what some of you are thinking.So let me reassure you about something.Some of your own regretsare also not as ugly as you think they are.I got this tattoobecause I spent most of my 20sliving outside the country and traveling.And when I came and settled in New York afterward,I was worried that I would forgetsome of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.Specifically the two things I learned about myselfthat I most didn&#39;t want to forgetwas how important it felt to keep exploringand, simultaneously, how important it isto somehow keep an eye on your own true north.And what I loved about this image of the compasswas that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideasin one simple image.And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device.
时间：15:19
zh-cn:不过确实是只是让我想起的不是我当初希望的而常常是其他东西它常常让我想起关于遗憾的教训也是生命中最重要的教训之一讽刺的是，我想这可能唯一的最重要的我能把它纹到身上的东西－既是作为一名作家也是作为一个人总之就是如果我们有目标和梦想我们想尽最大的努力或者如果我们爱一些人不希望伤害到他们或失去他们当这些出现问题的时候我们理应感到痛苦问题的关键不是生而无悔而是不要因后悔而厌恨自己
en:Well it did.But it turns out, it doesn&#39;t remind me of the thing I thought it would;it reminds me constantly of something else instead.It actually reminds meof the most important lesson regret can teach us,which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us.And ironically, I think it&#39;s probably the single most important thingI possibly could have tattooed onto my body —partly as a writer,but also just as a human being.Here&#39;s the thing,if we have goalsand dreams,and we want to do our best,and if we love peopleand we don&#39;t want to hurt them or lose them,we should feel pain when things go wrong.The point isn&#39;t to live without any regrets.The point is to not hate ourselves for having them.
时间：16:14
zh-cn:我从纹身上学到的东西我想今天跟你们分享的就是：我们应该学会去爱我们制造出来的不完美有缺陷的东西并原谅自己导致了这样的结果遗憾并不是要提醒我们所做的糟糕行为而是提醒我们可以做得更好
en:The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattooand that I want to leave you with todayis this:We need to learn to lovethe flawed, imperfect thingsthat we createand to forgive ourselves for creating them.Regret doesn&#39;t remind us that we did badly.It reminds us that we know we can do better.
