zh-cn:我要讲的不是技术，而是人和他们的故事。最近电视上，播出了一段60分钟的高清视频。我想很多人都看过了。它拍摄的是现在美国退伍军人管理局的局长。他39年前在越南失去了一只手臂，他坚定地认为那些奇怪的机械义肢是不会有用的。在这段60分钟的拍摄开始前，他明确地表示，他已经有了带钩子的木棍做手臂的代替品。而他用了这个新义肢还不到两个小时就可以给自己倒饮料了，这让他激动不已。他是这么说的：这是他39年以来第一次感到自己的手臂又回来了。
en:It&#39;s not about technology,it&#39;s about people and stories.I could show youwhat recently was on televisionas a high quality video:60 Minutes, many of you may have seen it.And it was the now director of the entire pieceof the veteran&#39;s administration —who, himself, had lost an arm 39 years agoin Vietnam —who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devicesthat don&#39;t work.And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background,after he pretty much made his position clear on this —he had his hook and he had his —he wore this arm for less than two hoursand was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the factthat, quote — his quote —it&#39;s the first time he&#39;s felt like he&#39;s had an arm in 39 years.

zh-cn:这其实并不是故事的开头，我也不准备给你们看这段精致的视频。我下面要给你们看的，是一段没有剪辑过的早期视频。因为我觉得这样你们可以更了解这个故事。
en:But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story,and I&#39;m not going to show you that polished video.I&#39;m going to, instead, in a minute or two,show you an early, crude videobecause I think it&#39;sa better way to tell a story.

zh-cn:几年前，国防部高级研究计划局的人来找我。这些人专门资助开发那些商业界和大学不肯冒险去做的先进技术。而他们现在对那些可以帮助士兵们的人很感兴趣。总之，我接到了这个意料外的拜访。当时坐在我的会议室里的，是一位资深的军医和国防部研究计划局的负责人。
en:A few years ago I was visited bythe guy that runs DARPA,the people that fund all the advanced technologiesthat businesses and universities probably wouldn&#39;t take the risk of doing.They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.I get this sort of unrequested — by me anyway — visit,and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeonfrom the militaryand the guy that runs DARPA.

zh-cn:他们告诉我一个故事，大意是我们使用的医疗技术已经十分先进，即使在像阿富汗或是伊拉克的山区这样最偏远的驻军处，士兵们也能受益于这些技术。他们骄傲的说,如果有士兵们受伤了,在尘硝未尽时这些伤员就会被找到并带回来，并得到顶级的急救护理。比我们在美国的一个大城市里遭车祸受伤后得到的急救更加快。这些是好的方面。
en:They proceed to tell me a story which comes downto basically the following. We have used such advanced technologiesnow and made them availablein the most remote places that we put soldiers:hills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...They were quite proud of the fact thatyou know, before the dust clears,if some soldier has been hurtthey will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,they will be getting world-class triage emergency carefaster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurtin a car accident in a major city in the United States.That&#39;s the good news.

zh-cn:而坏消息是，如果他们带回来的人失去了一只手臂，一条腿或是一部分的脸，那他面临基本就是终生残疾。接着他们给我看了那些失去手臂的战士们的人数统计。然后那位军医愤怒的说：“在用步枪打仗的内战末期，如果有人失去了一只手臂，我们给他一只带钩子的木棍做代替。现在，我们有了黄蜂和猛禽战机，但是如果有人失去了一只手臂，为什么我们能给他的还只是一只带钩子的塑料棍？”
en:The bad news is if they&#39;ve collected this personand he or she is missing an arm or leg,part of the face, it&#39;s probably not coming back.So, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm.And then the surgeon pointed out, with a lot of anger,he said, &quot;Why is it? At the end of the Civil War,they were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm,we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it.Now we&#39;ve got F18s and F22s,and if somebody loses an arm,we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it.&quot;
时间： 3:06
zh-cn:他们认为这根本说不过去。“所以，迪恩我们来这是想让你为我们做一只手臂。”我正等着他们给我看那可能长达500页的来自官方机构的、国防部的文件。不，他说“我们会带一个人来这，给他装上你做的义肢，然后他或她可以从桌上拿起一粒葡萄干或是葡萄。如果拿的是葡萄，他们不会把它捏碎。“好吧，那他需要传出，传入和触觉的反应传感器。”如果拿的是葡萄干，他会拿得很稳，不会弄掉。“那么，还需要良好的电机控制来保证腕关节的弯曲肘部的弯曲，及肩膀的伸展和弯曲。无论拿的是什么，他们都会把它吃下去。
en:And they basically said, &quot;This is unacceptable,&quot;and then the punchline: &quot;So, Dean,we&#39;re here because you make medical stuff.You&#39;re going to give us an arm.&quot;And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,paperwork and DODs.No, the guy says,&quot;We&#39;re going to bring a guy into this conference room,and wearing the arm you&#39;re going to give us,he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grapeoff this table.If it&#39;s the grape, they won&#39;t break it.&quot;Great he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.&quot;If it&#39;s the raisin, they won&#39;t drop it.&quot;So he wants fine motor control: flex at the wrist,flex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder.Either way they were going to eat it.
时间： 3:57
zh-cn:”哦，对了，迪恩，这义肢应该适合百分之五十女性的身体结构，也就是说它到中指有32英寸长，而且轻于9磅。(要适合)百分之五十的女性。这个手臂应该是完全自足的，包括电源在内。“他们终于说完了。我很明显是个胆小的人。我告诉他们他们疯了。（笑声）他们终结者看多了。（笑声）然后，那个军医说：”迪恩，你应该知道，超过24个孩子回来时已经失去双臂“我无法想象，也许你们的想象力比我丰富，但是我实在不能想象自己在22岁这个年纪，失去一只手臂会是怎样的情况。但是这和两只手臂都没有了比起来却显得方便多了。
en:&quot;Oh, by the way Dean. It&#39;s going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame —namely 32 inches from the long finger —and weigh less than nine pounds.&quot;50th percentile female frame.&quot;And it&#39;s going to be completely self contained including all its power.&quot;So, they finished that. And I, as you can tell,am a bashful guy.I told them they&#39;re nuts.(Laughter)They&#39;ve been watching too much &quot;Terminator.&quot;(Laughter)Then, the surgeon says to me,&quot;Dean, you need to knowmore than two dozen of these kids have come backbilateral.&quot;Now, I cannot imagine —I&#39;m sorry, you may have a betterimagination than I do —I can&#39;t imagine losing my arm,and typically at 22 years old.But compared to that, losing two?Seems like that would be an inconvenience.
时间： 4:58
zh-cn:就这样，那天晚上回到家，我开始考虑这事。我怎么也睡不着，满脑子想着一个人要是没有肩膀要怎么翻身。所以，我决定我要做这个义肢。然而，我白天的工作很多，真的很多。我大部分的工作时间用在了为我的诸如弗斯特(迪恩 卡门创立的科学技术项目)和水抑或电力之类的梦想提供资金所以光是白天的工作都已经很多了。但是我认为，”我一定要做这件事。“我做了一点调查。我去了华盛顿，告诉他们我还是觉得他们疯了，但是我决定要做下去。我说我会给他们做一只义肢。我说这个义肢大概5年才能通过食品药品管理局的审核，大概10年才能正常运作。就像当初苹果刚推出Ipod时一样。”好，“他说，”你只有两年时间。“（笑声）我说，”这样说吧，在一年内我会做出一只义肢。它会少于9磅并且具备所有那些功能。但我需要9年使它能够正常的工作。“我们各自保留不同意见。
en:Anyway, I went home that night. I thought about it.I literally could not sleepthinking about, &quot;I wonder how you&#39;d roll overwith no shoulders.&quot;So, I decided we&#39;ve got to do this.And trust me, I&#39;ve got a day job, I&#39;ve got a lot of day jobs.Most of my day job keeps me busyfunding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ....And I&#39;ve got a lot of day jobs.But I figured I gotta do this.Did a little investigation,went down to Washington, told themI still think they&#39;re nuts but we&#39;re going to do it.And I told them I&#39;d build them an arm.I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA,and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.Look what it takes to make things like iPods.&quot;Great,&quot; he said, &quot;You got two years.&quot;(Laughter)I said, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what. I&#39;ll build you an armthat&#39;s under nine poundsthat has all that capability in one year.It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful.&quot;We sort of agreed to disagree.
时间： 6:04
zh-cn:回去后，我开始召集我能找到的最优秀的并且热衷于此的人，组成工作团队。整整一年后，我们做出了具备14个自由度的义肢。所有的传感器，所有的微处理器，所有的东西都包括在里面了。如果在上面做些修饰，你会发现它几可乱真，但那样你就看不到它里面有趣的部分了。然后，我想接下来可能还需要好多年才能让它变得真正实用。但实际上，你们可以从艾米的表现和态度中看出，那些强烈想要做成某事的人是多么的了不起，他们的适应性是多么的强。
en:I went back and I started putting a team together,the best guys I could find with a passion to do this.At the end of exactly one yearwe had a device with 14 degrees of freedom,all the sensors, all the microprocessors,all the stuff inside.I could show you it with a cosmesis on itthat&#39;s so real it&#39;s eerie, but then you wouldn&#39;t seeall this cool stuff.I then thought it would be yearsbefore we&#39;d be able to make it really, really useful.It turned out, as I think you could seein Aimee&#39;s capabilities and attitudes,people with a desire to do somethingare quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable.
时间： 6:46
zh-cn:就这样，两个试用者装上了义肢不过10小时，其中一个两只手臂都没了，一边的肩膀完全没了，另一边肩膀也只剩下一小节。他们，查克和兰迪，在我们的办公室待了10个多小时。而我们为他们拍了一些简单但不错的录影。等一下结束前我会放映一段只有一分钟左右的和几段几秒钟的录影。查克做了一件到现在我还在嫉妒的事。因为我自己根本做不到。他拿起一根勺子，舀了一勺小麦片和牛奶，拿稳勺子，同时运用所有的关节把勺子放进嘴里，而且没有泼出一点牛奶。（笑声）我可做不到啊。（笑声）他的妻子站在我后面。她当时正站在我后面。她说，”迪恩，查克已经19年没有自己喂自己吃过东西了。所以，你现在有个选择：要不让我们把这个手臂带回去，要不你把查克带回去。“(笑声)
en:Anyway, with less than 10 hours of use,two guys — one that&#39;s bilateral.He&#39;s literally, he&#39;s got no shoulder on one side,and he&#39;s high trans-humeral on the other.And that&#39;s Chuck and Randy together,after 10 hours — were playing in our office.And we took some pretty cruddy home movies.At the end of the one I&#39;m going to show, it&#39;s only about a minuteand a couple of seconds long,Chuck does something that to this day I&#39;m jealous of,I can&#39;t do it.He picks up a spoon, picks it up,scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk,holds the spoon levelas he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously,to his mouth, and he doesn&#39;t drop any milk.(Laughter)I cannot do that.(Laughter)His wife was standing behind me.She&#39;s standing behind me at the timeand she says, &quot;Dean,Chuck hasn&#39;t fed himself in 19 years.So, you&#39;ve got a choice:We keep the arm, or you keep Chuck.&quot;(Laughter) (Applause)
时间： 8:00
zh-cn:现在，我们来看录影这是查克在同时运用所有的关节。他在用拳打我们的控制人员。在他后面的是我们的工程师兼外科医生，有他在总是很方便。这是兰迪，他们在传递一个小橡皮球。而且，基于弗斯特的优雅而专业精神他们为此很是自豪于是他们准备分享一瓶饮料。这不是一件简单的事。想象要是用一根一头带钩子的木棍该怎么倒饮料，或是接饮料。现在查克正在做一件不寻常的事，至少对于我来说。现在，他要做国防部研究局让我完成的事。他拿起了一粒葡萄，没有弄掉也没有弄碎。他把它吃了下去。好了，这就是15个月后我们的成果。（掌声）
en:So, can we see that?This is Chuck showing simultaneous controlof all the joints.He&#39;s punching our controls guy. The guy behind himis our engineer/surgeon,which is a convenient guy to have around.There&#39;s Randy, these guys are passing a rubberlittle puck between them.And just as in the spirit of FIRST,gracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this,so they decide to share a drink.This is a non-trivial thing to do, by the way.Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it,doing either of those.Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary,at least for my limited physical skill.And now he&#39;s going to do what DARPA asked me for.He&#39;s going to pick up a grape — he didn&#39;t drop it,he didn&#39;t break it —and he&#39;s going to eat it.So, that&#39;s where we wereat the end of about 15 months.(Applause)
时间： 9:19
zh-cn:但是，我从理查德那学到，技术，处理器，传感器，电动机，并不重要。我没有关心这些方面的问题，或者说，这整个与医学相关的部分我都没有关心。我要讲一些在我们开始做义肢时发生的惊人的事。在我们确信我们设计得很好了后，我们还需要做所有工程师都做的取舍。通常你可以从四样想要的东西中选出三样来，比如在重量，大小，花费，功能里进行挑选。我把一帮人带上了飞机，我告诉他们我们现在要去沃尔特里德医院，去和那些孩子们聊天。因为实际上无论我们喜不喜欢这个手臂都不要紧。国防部喜不喜欢这个手臂也不要紧。在我说的时候，他们并不感兴趣。但是我说，他们的观点如何一点也不重要。重点只有一个，那些孩子们会不会用这个手臂。
en:But, as I&#39;ve learned from Richard,the technology, the processors, the sensors, the motors,is not the story.I hadn&#39;t dealt with this kind of problemor frankly, this whole segmentof the medical world.I&#39;ll give you some astounding things that have happenedas we started this.After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design,and we&#39;d have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make —you can always get three out of four of anything you want;the weight, the size, the cost, the functionality —I put a bunch of guys in my planeand I said, &quot;We&#39;re flying down to Walter Reed, and we&#39;re going talk to these kids,because frankly it doesn&#39;t matter whether we like this arm.It doesn&#39;t matter whether theDepartment of Defense likes this arm.&quot;When I told them that they weren&#39;t entirely enthusiastic,but I told them, &quot;It really doesn&#39;t matter what their opinion is.There is only one opinion that matters,the kids that are either going to use it or not.&quot;
时间：10:21
zh-cn:我告诉我的工程师们，”我们要去沃尔特里德医院，在那里，你们会看到很多失去了身体重要部分的人。这些人可能是愤怒的，消沉的，沮丧的。所以我们需要给他们支持和鼓励，但我们要从他们那儿获取足够的信息以保证我们现在所做的事情是正确的。当我们走进沃尔特里德医院时，我发现自己大错特错了。我们的确见到了很多人。其中有很多人失去了身体的众多部件，而剩下的部分还被烧伤了，有的半张脸没有了，或是一只耳朵烧掉了。
en:I told a bunch of my engineers, &quot;Look we&#39;re going to walk into Walter Reed,and you&#39;re going to see people, lots of them,missing major body parts.They&#39;re probably going to be angry, depressed, frustrated.We&#39;re probably going to have to give them support, encouragement.But we&#39;ve got to extract from themenough information to make sure we&#39;re doing the right thing.&quot;We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong.We did see a bunch of people,a lot of them missing a lot of body parts,and parts they had left were burned;half a face gone, an ear burned off.
时间：11:06
zh-cn:他们被带来这里，坐在一张桌子旁与我们聊天。我们问了他们很多我们想知道的事。“看，”我告诉他们，“我们还没有像造物主那么厉害。我可以给你们良好的运动控制系统，或者我可以让你们举起40磅，但是我恐怕不能同时完成这两项。我可以给你们带低损耗率传动装置的快速控制系统，或者我可以给你们力量，但我不能同时完成这两项。我们尝试着让他们告诉我们他们到底需要什么。他们不但很感兴趣，而且不断地考虑怎样才能帮到我们。”这样能起到帮助吗....&quot;大家听我说，你们给予的够多了。我们来这是为了帮助你们。我们需要数据，我们需要知道你们想要什么。
en:They were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us.And we started asking them all questions.&quot;Look,&quot; I&#39;d say to them, &quot;We&#39;re not quite as good as nature yet.I could give you fine motor control,or I could let you curl 40 pounds;I probably can&#39;t do both.I can give you fast controlwith low reduction ratios in these gears,or I can give you power;I can&#39;t give you both.And we were trying to get them to all help usknow what to give them.Not only were they enthusiastic, they kept thinkingthey&#39;re there to help us.&quot;Well, would it help if I ...&quot;&quot;Guys, and woman,you&#39;ve given enough.We&#39;re here to help you. We need data. We need to knowwhat you need.&quot;
时间：11:50
zh-cn:半个小时左右后，有一个坐在桌子远端的人没有说上什么。他失去了一只手臂。而他正用另一只手撑着脑袋我叫他说，“嘿，你还没有说什么呢，如果是这个或这个，你想要哪一个？”然后他说，“你知道吗，我是这个桌子上的幸运儿。我失去了我的右臂，但是我是个左撇子。”（笑声）所以，他没有怎么说话。他有伟大的精神，他们都有。然后他做了一番评论。聚会结束后，我们向所有的人道别，然后那人把自己从桌子边推出，他没有腿。
en:After a half an hour, maybe, there was one guy at the far end of the tablewho wasn&#39;t saying much.You could see he was missing an arm.He was leaning on his other arm.I called down to the end, &quot;Hey, you haven&#39;t said much.If we needed this or this, what would you want?&quot;And he said, &quot;You know,I&#39;m the lucky guy at this table.I lost my right arm,but I&#39;m a lefty.&quot;(Laughter)So, he wouldn&#39;t say much.He had a great spirit, like all the rest of them had great spirits.And he made a few comments.And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys.And that guy pushed himself back from the table ...he has no legs.
时间：12:36
zh-cn:然后，我们离开了。我想我们没有给他们支持和鼓励，是他们给了我们这些。而他们还一直再给。这是令人震惊的。就这样，我们回去了。我开始更努力地、更快地工作。然后我们去了布鲁克陆军医学中心。接着我们看到了很多这样的孩子，很多很多。以及他们那令人震惊的乐观的生活态度。然后，我们又回去了。回去后更是倍加努力地工作。我们开始了临床实验，安装了5个义肢在人身上。我们在独自挣扎。然后我接到了一个电话，我们又去了华盛顿。
en:So, we left.And I was thinking,&quot;We didn&#39;t give them support and encouragement;they gave it to us.They&#39;re not finished giving yet.&quot;It was astounding.So, we went back.And I started working harder, faster.Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center.And we saw lots of these kids, lots of them.And it was astoundinghow positive they are.So, we went back,and we&#39;ve been working harder yet.We&#39;re in clinical trials,we&#39;ve got five of them on people.We&#39;re screaming along.And I get a call and we go backto Washington.
时间：13:33
zh-cn:我们再次去了沃尔特里德医院。那里有个孩子，正值20岁的大好年华，不幸遭遇了一场爆炸。他先是被送去了德国24小时后他们把他从德国运到了沃尔特里德医院。然后他就在那了。他们说我们一定得来。于是我去了。他们把他推到一个房间里。他已经失去了双腿。也失去了双臂。他只在身体一边还剩下一小部分肢体，他的半张脸已经没有了，但他们说他的视力回复了。他有一只好的眼睛。他叫布兰登 摩洛克。
en:We go back to Walter Reed,and a kid, literally,20 some-odd days before thatwas blown up.And they shipped him to Germanyand 24 hours later they shipped him from Germanyto Walter Reed.And he was there,and they said we needed to come.And I went downand they rolled him into a room.He&#39;s got no legs.He&#39;s got no arms.He&#39;s got a small residual limb on one side.Half of his face is gone,but they said his vision is coming back.He had one good eye.His name is Brandon Marrocco.
时间：14:23
zh-cn:然后他说，“我需要你发明的手臂，但我需要两个。”你会得到他们的。这个孩子来自斯塔藤岛（位于美国纽约）。接着他说，“我有一辆卡车，在我去那边之前，它有一个棍子。你觉得我还能再开它么？”当然。然后我转身思考，“这下该怎么办啊？”（笑声）不管怎样，他就像剩下的所有人一样。他真的不需要很多。他告诉我，他想帮忙。他想回去去帮助他的同伴。
en:And he said,&quot;I need your arms,but I need two of them.&quot;&quot;You&#39;ll get them.&quot;This kid was from Staten Island.And he said, &quot;I had a truck,before I went over there,and it had a stick.You think I&#39;ll be able to drive it?&quot;&quot;Sure.&quot;And I turned around and went, &quot;How are we going to do this?&quot;(Laughter)Anyway, he was just like all the rest of them.He doesn&#39;t really want a lot.He wants to help. He told me thathe wanted to go backto help his buddies.
时间：15:05
zh-cn:所以，我来到了这里。我被邀请去了德克萨斯州。在退役士兵管理局，有3500个人。美国在这件重要的事情上只有3500个人来帮助那些孩子们的家庭。这些孩子，有的死了有的像布兰登一样。而他们希望我去做一个演讲。我说，“我该说些什么呢？这些并不是好事情。要是，发生在你们身上我能给你们的永远比不上你原来自己的手臂。“”我们需要你过来一趟。“
en:So, I was on my way out here.I was asked to stop at Texas.There were 3,500 people,the Veteran&#39;s Administration,U.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge eventto help the familiesof all the kids —some that have died, some that arelike Brandon —and they wanted me to speak.I said, &quot;What am I going to say?This is not a happy thing. Look, if this happens to you,I can give you ... This stuff isstill not as good at the original equipment.&quot;&quot;You need to come.&quot;
时间：15:45
zh-cn:所以，我去了。你们大概可以想象，那儿有很多人在康复。有些人比其他人伤的更严重。但是，每一个经历了这些的人都有着惊人的乐观态度。而只是他人的关心，对于这些人就有着巨大的影响。
en:So, I went.And, as I think you get the point,there were a lot people there recovering.Some further along than others.But universally, these people that had been through thishad astounding attitudes,and just the fact that people caremakes a huge difference to them.
时间：16:10
zh-cn:最后，我还想跟你们说一个我所忧虑的事情。我不并是说有谁是故意这样做的，但是，有很多人一直在强调他们可以得到什么。就你们所知，这个国家一直在争论医疗保健的问题。谁拥有什么样的利益？谁拥有多少利益？谁来支付这些利益？都是些很难的问题。我没有这些问题的答案。并不是每个出生在这里的人都会得到所有的利益，。虽然那样很美好，但是是不可能的。所以让我们现实一些吧。
en:I&#39;ll shut up, except one messageor concern I have.I don&#39;t think anybody does it intentionally,but there were people there literally talking about,&quot;Well, how much will they get?&quot;You know, this country is involved as we&#39;ve all heard,in this great healthcare debate.&quot;Who is entitled to what?Who is entitled to how much?Who is going to pay for it?&quot;Those are tough questions.I don&#39;t have an answer to that. Not everybodycan be entitled to everything simply because you were born here.It&#39;s not possible. It would be nicebut let&#39;s be realistic.
时间：16:56
zh-cn:这些都是难题。有许多意见相左的阵营。我不知道这些问题的答案。还有另一些难题。我们应该在这儿吗？我们该怎样离开？我们该做些什么？对于这些问题也有着许多不同的答案。而我也没有这些问题的的答案。对于那些政治方面的，经济方面的和策略方面的问题，我也不知道该怎样回答。但我有一个简单的想法，也可以说是立场。这是一个简单的答案。
en:They were tough questions. There&#39;s polarized groups down there.I don&#39;t know the answers.There are other questions that are tough.&quot;Should we be there?How do we get out?What do we need to do?&quot; There&#39;s very polarizedanswers to that question too,and I don&#39;t have any answers to that.Those are political questions, economic questions,strategic questions.I don&#39;t have the answer. But let me give you a simpleconcern or maybe statement, then.It is an easy answer.
时间：17:31
zh-cn:我知道什么是这些受伤了的孩子在医疗方面应得的。我和其中一个孩子聊过天，他很喜欢这个机械义肢，因为这比一支带钩的塑料棍好很多。但是现在在场的人，没有人会愿意用义肢代替原来的手臂。但，我告诉那个孩子，“你知道吗，第一架飞机在1903年飞行了100英尺。那是威尔伯和奥威尔制造的。但那并不会让鸽子羡慕。然而我们现在有了老鹰战机，F 15鹰式战机，甚至是秃鹰战机。我从没在马赫机场附近看过一只飞鸟。所以我想我们最终一定会有非凡的成果。”我还对他说，“在你的伙伴嫉妒你的义肢的能力和用法之时，我会停止我的工作。在那之前，我会一直做下去。不停止地做下去。”
en:I know what these kids deserveon the healthcare side.I was talking to one of them,and he was really liking this arm —it&#39;s way, way, way better than a plasticstick with a hook on it —but there&#39;s nobody in this room that would rather have thatthan the one you got.But I was saying to him, &quot;You know,the first airplanewent 100 feet in 1903.Wilbur and Orville.But you know what? It wouldn&#39;t have made an old pigeon jealous.But now we got Eagles out there,F15s, even that Bald Eagle.I&#39;ve never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2.I think eventually we&#39;ll make these things extraordinary.&quot;And I said to that kid,&quot;I&#39;ll stop when your buddiesare envious of your Luke armbecause of what it can do, and how it does it.And we&#39;ll keep working. And I&#39;m not going to stop workinguntil we do that.&quot;
时间：18:42
zh-cn:我认为这个国家应该继续它的辩论。还有关于“我有权利”“你是受害者”的抱怨。关于我们外交政策的抱怨。但在我们奢望着抱怨着谁该出钱，我们得到了多少的同时，记得是有些人让给了我们抱怨的特权。我知道什么是他们应得的，他们应该得到我们所能做到的一切。我们应该给他们。（掌声）
en:And I think this countryought to continue its great debate,whining and complaining, &quot;I&#39;m entitled.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re a victim.&quot;And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be.But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining aboutwho&#39;s paying for what and how much we get,the people that are out theregiving us that great privilege of whining and complaining,I know what they deserve:everything humanly possible.And we ought to give it to them.(Applause)
