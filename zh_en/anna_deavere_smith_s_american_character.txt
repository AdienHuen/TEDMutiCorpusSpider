zh-cn:小时候，祖父曾经告诉我说，“要是你经常说某个字，那个字就是你的写照。”我长在马里兰州的巴尔迪摩，一个偏僻的城市，带着祖父告诉我的这个信念和一个录音机，我周游美洲我要感谢科技采访各式各样的人，想象如果我能走进他们的故事中—这也是我在表演的时候不穿鞋的原因—如果我能走进他们的故事，我多少能够领悟这个国家（美国）。Walt Whitman 也曾给我以启示，他也曾经想要领悟美国，并向这个国家奉献他自己的知识与智慧。
en:So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,&quot;If you say a word often enough, it becomes you.&quot;And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder —thank God for technology —to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words —which is also why I don&#39;t wear shoes when I perform —if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.I was also inspired by Walt Whitman,who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.

zh-cn:因此，我要表演的四个角色是来源于我的工作是我从事多年的工作并且在—我想，我采访过的数千人中最有代表意义的。现场有谁年龄稍大些，听说过那个老无线电工，Studs Terlek？那好，我认为他可能是能回答关于美国历史上一个决定性的时刻的最佳人选。要知道，Stud Terkel“生于1912，泰坦尼克号沉没的那一年，史上最伟大的船。却撞上了冰川一角。紧接着，砰！它沉没海底，就这样沉没了，然后我出生了。瞧瞧，这个世纪多了不起。”（笑）
en:So these four characters are going to be from that workthat I&#39;ve been doing for many years now,and well over, I don&#39;t know, a couple of thousand peopleI&#39;ve interviewed.Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?So I thought he would be the perfect personto go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.You know, he was &quot;born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg,and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century.&quot;(Laughter)

zh-cn:这是Stud 对于美国历史上一个决定性时刻的回答。美国历史上的决定性时刻，我认为没有；你不能说就是广岛，那是个大事件—我觉得我无法想出哪一个时刻为决定性时刻。那种逐渐的沦丧—沦丧是人们用在水门事件上的词，道德沦丧—是一种逐渐改变的东西，是多种事物结合的产物。你看，我们还拥有科技。（可是）越来越少的人际交往。
en:So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.&quot;Defining moment in American history, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one;you can&#39;t say Hiroshima, that&#39;s a big one —I can&#39;t think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.The gradual slippage — &#39;slippage&#39; is the wordused by the people in Watergate, moral slippage —it&#39;s a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.You see, we also have the technology.I say, less and less the human touch.

zh-cn:哦，我来说一个好玩的事。亚特兰大机场是个现代化机场，他们应该把那扇门留在那。这些能够带你来往于各个转运站与目的地之间的火车。它们行车平稳。它们安静且高效。并且，火车上你可以听到声音，你知道那是人的声音。过去我们有机器人，机器人模仿人类。而现在是人类模仿机器人。因此，在这列火车上我们听到这个声音：第一站：奥马哈，林肯。第二站：达拉斯，沃斯堡市。还是同样的声音。就在火车要开的时候，一对年轻恋人冲了进来这时候气动门马上就要关闭了。这时，那个声音，节奏不改，继续说道，“由于有乘客晚上车，本列车延迟30秒。”正在那时，每人都带着不满瞪着这对年轻人这对年轻人就像这样，蜷缩在一起。而我呢，恰好在上车前喝了几杯—以镇定我的神经—然后我模仿火车广播，把手放在这儿—Geroge Orwell，你的死期到啦，你瞧。看，台下的有些人笑了。听到我这么说每个人都会笑。但是在那列火车上是一片沉默，没有人笑。突然之间，所有人看着我。于是，我和那对恋人一起，我们三个我们三个缩成一团，仿佛于骷髅地脚下，准备受罚。
en:&quot;Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit.The Atlanta airport is a modern airport,and they should leave the gate there.These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.And these trains are smooth,and they&#39;re quiet and they&#39;re efficient.And there&#39;s a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.Now we have humans imitating robots.So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush inand they&#39;re just about to close the pneumatic doors.And that voice, without losing a beat, says,&#39;Because of late entry, we&#39;re delayed 30 seconds.&#39;Just then, everybody&#39;s looking at this couple with hateful eyesand the couple&#39;s going like this, you know, shrinking.Well, I&#39;d happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding —I do that to steel my nerves — and soI imitate a train call, holding my hand on my —&#39;George Orwell, your time has come,&#39; you see.Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughswhen I say that, but not on this train. Silence.And so suddenly they&#39;re looking at me.So here I am with the couple, the three of usshrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.

zh-cn:就在这个时候我看到一个婴儿，小小的婴儿，躺在妈妈腿上。我知道这是一个西班牙裔的母亲，因为她跟同伴讲着西班牙语。我打算跟这个孩子说话。于是我对这个孩子说，手盖住我的嘴，因为我的呼吸带着太强的酒味了，我说，“尊敬的先生或是女士，您对人类的真知灼见又是什么呢？”婴儿看着我，就是那种婴儿清澈无瑕地注视的方式，笑了起来，开始大声地稚嫩地笑起来。我说，“谢天谢地，总算有人类的反应了，我们还没丢掉它。”
en:&quot;Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.I know it&#39;s Hispanic because she&#39;s speaking Spanish to her companion.So I&#39;m going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby,holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof,I say to the baby, &#39;Sir or Madam,what is your considered opinion of the human species?&#39;And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly,starts laughing,starts busting out with this crazy little laugh.I say, &#39;Thank God for a human reaction, we haven&#39;t lost yet.&#39;

zh-cn:但是你看，人情味，你看，它正在消失殆尽。你瞧，我们必须质疑这个真理。你知道，马克吐温的伟大之处在于—我们尊崇马克吐温，但我们不读他的作品。我们读《哈克·费恩历险记》，当然了，我们肯定会去读。我的意思是，哈克，他当然很了不起。你还记得在筏子上见识的那美丽景色吗，还记得哈克都做了什么吗？你看，这就是哈克，他是个聪明的孩子，（尽管）没上过学，但他拥有一些特别的东西。而且事实的真相，真理就是，一个黑人被视作财富，他被当回事，你瞧。
en:&quot;But you see, the human touch, you see, it&#39;s disappearing.You know, you see, you&#39;ve got to question the official truth.You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain —you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don&#39;t read him.We read &#39;Huck Finn,&#39; of course, we read &#39;Huck Finn&#39; of course.I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?You see, here&#39;s Huck; he&#39;s an illiterate kid; he&#39;s had no schooling,but there&#39;s something in him.And the official truth, the truth was, the law was,that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.
时间： 4:18
zh-cn:哈克上了筏子的同时也带了一样资产，这个叫Jim的奴隶。他听到Jim要离开去救他的老婆和孩子要从他们原来的女主人那里他们偷回来，然后哈克说，“哦，哦我的天哪，哦，哦—那个女人，那个女人从来没伤害过任何人。哦，他要去偷，他要去偷啊，他要去做一件大坏事。”就在那时，两个奴隶赶了上来，他们在正找人，找Jim。“那个筏子上还有别人吗？”哈克说，“有。”“黑人还是白人？”“白人。”然后他们就离开了。然后哈克说，“哦天哪，哦天哪，我撒谎了，我撒谎了，哦，我做了件大坏事，一件大坏事—但是为什么我感到很舒坦呢？”
en:And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kidsand steal them from the woman who owns them,and Huck says, &#39;Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh —that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.Ooh, he&#39;s going to steal; he&#39;s going to steal;he&#39;s going to do a terrible thing.&#39;Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.&#39;Anybody up on that raft with you?&#39; Huck says, &#39;Yeah.&#39;&#39;Is he black or white?&#39; &#39;White.&#39; And they go off.And Huck said, &#39;Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh,I did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing — why do I feel so good?&#39;
时间： 5:08
zh-cn:但是这个哈克的善良，这是哈克的本质，你瞧，全都被淹没了，全被淹没了。所以人情味，你瞧，正在消失。所以你要问决定性时刻。对我来说，在美国的历史上没有决定性时刻。是各种时刻不断累加，构成了现在我们所处的时代，琐事都变成了新闻。越来越多的，越来越少的痛苦，或是其他。哼，你知道，我不知道你会不会这样说，但是我要引用一个内布拉斯加的作家的话，叫Wright Morris，他说，我们沟通的花样越来越多但是真正的沟通却越来越少了好了，孩子们，我得走了，要去看我的心脏医师了。这就是Studs Terkel。（掌声）
en:&quot;But it&#39;s the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck&#39;s been made of,you see, all been buried; it&#39;s all been buried.So the human touch, you see, it&#39;s disappearing.So you ask about a defining moment —ain&#39;t no defining moment in American history for me.It&#39;s an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now,where trivia becomes news.And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.Huh. You know, I don&#39;t know if you could use this or not,but I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says,&#39;We&#39;re more and more into communicationsand less and less into communication.&#39;Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist.&quot;And that&#39;s Studs Terkel.(Applause)

zh-cn:那么，谈到勇于冒险。我要提到一个大家都不喜欢的人。大多数演员都希望扮演讨人喜欢的角色—也不总是，但是这种观念（是有的），尤其是像TED大会这样的场面，我喜欢激励人。不过既然说到勇于冒险，我要模仿一个我从来没模仿过的人，因为她是如此讨人厌恶那个人实际上在后台叫我把关于她的戏份去掉。那么我之所以模仿她是因为我认为冒险，在这样的会议里，是一件好事。
en:So, talk about risk taking. I&#39;m going to do somebody that nobody likes.You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable —well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this,I like to inspire people.But since this was called &quot;risk taking,&quot;I&#39;m doing somebody who I never do, because she&#39;s so unlikeablethat one person actually came backstageand told me to take her out of the show she was in.And I&#39;m doing her because I think we think of risk,at a conference like this, as a good thing.
时间： 6:31
zh-cn:不过“冒险”这个词还蕴有其他含义，“天性”这个词也是一样。什么是“天性”？Maxine Greene，是一个伟大的哲学家和Studs的岁数差不多，而且他是一个—很大的哲学组织的领导，我向她问道有哪两个事情是她不知道却依然想要弄清楚的。他说，“就我个人看来，我总是觉得在见到我的大学校长时我还要卑躬屈膝。而且我仍旧感觉要为男同事端咖啡尽管我比他们活的都长。然后她说，“突然间理性告诉我，我对于负面幻想理解的不够。9.11事件显然告诉我们有一整片领域我们是没有研究的。”
en:But there are certain other connotations to the word &quot;risk,&quot;and the same thing about the word &quot;nature.&quot; What is nature?Maxine Greene, who&#39;s a wonderful philosopherwho&#39;s as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy —great, big philosophy kind of an organization —I went to her and asked her what are the two thingsthat she doesn&#39;t know, that she still wants to know.And she said, &quot;Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtseywhen I see the president of my university.And I still feel as though I&#39;ve got to get coffeefor my male colleagues, even though I&#39;ve outlived most of them.&quot;And she said, &quot;And then intellectually,I don&#39;t know enough about the negative imagination.And September 11th certainly taught usthat that&#39;s a whole area we don&#39;t investigate.&quot;
时间： 7:12
zh-cn:因此这一段是关于负面幻想的。它引发了思考如什么是天性，什么是大自然，以及什么是冒险。来自于马里兰女性教养所。我做的事情就是一字不漏的录下来。我之所以加以标题是因为我认为人们以组织化的方式讲话，它叫做“她嘴边的镜子。”主人公是一个叫做Paulette Jenkins的囚犯。
en:So this piece is about a negative imagination.It raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is,and about what a risk can be.And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.Everything I do is word for word off a tape.And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems,and this is called &quot;A Mirror to Her Mouth.&quot;And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.

zh-cn:“我开始学着掩盖事实，因为我不想让任何人知道这件事发生在我家里。我想让所有人都知道我们是一个正常的家庭。我们有正常家庭所拥有的一切表象，但这并未让我的孩子们的痛楚减轻分毫；这并未让他们的恐惧平息。关于眼睛如何被打黑破裂的嘴唇和淤青，这些我都词穷了。我已没有更多借口了。而且他也打了我。但这并不改变他是这个家庭的一个噩梦这个事实，一场噩梦。我让他们大失所望，因为我对事情的发展无动于衷。
en:&quot;I began to learn how to cover it up,because I didn&#39;t want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.I want everybody to think we were a normal family.I mean we had all the materialistic things,but that didn&#39;t make my children pain any less;that didn&#39;t make their fears subside.I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyesand busted lips and bruises. I didn&#39;t had no more excuses.And he beat me too. But that didn&#39;t change the factthat it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.And I failed them dramatically,because I allowed it to go on and on and on.

zh-cn:不过Myesha被杀的那晚—事情发展的越来越严重，直到有一天我们拿完毒品回到家中，他对Myesha大发雷霆，开始痛打她，他把她塞进浴缸。哦，他用皮带。他用皮带这种扭曲变态的东西是因为Myesha当时正在和她自己的弟弟做爱然后他们还互相爱抚—这就是原因。我现在讲的就是她死的那个晚上。于是他把她放进了浴缸，我当时和孩子在卧室里。
en:&quot;But the night that Myesha got killed —and the intensity just grew and grew and grew,until one night we came home from getting drugs,and he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her,and he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt.He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thingthat Myesha was having sex with her little brotherand they was fondling each other — that would be his reason.I&#39;m just talking about the particular night that she died.And so he put her in the bathtub,and I was in the bedroom with the baby.
时间： 8:55
zh-cn:而且在事情发生的四个月前，Myesha死前的四个月，我以为我可以治好这个男人。于是我给他生了一个孩子—太疯狂了—想着如果把他的亲生孩子交给他，他就会放我的孩子一马。但是都是徒劳，徒劳。于是我和三个孩子，Houston，Myesha和Dominic，我进监狱的时候他只有四岁。
en:&quot;And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died,I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him — insane —thinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.And it didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t work.And I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic,who was four months old when I came to jail.

zh-cn:我在卧室里，就像刚才说的，他把她拖到浴室然后他—他—每次他动粗，她都会倒下。然后他把她的头砸向浴缸。不停的，一次又一次。我能听见，但是我却一动都不敢动。我没有动。我甚至没有去看看到底发生了什么。我只是坐在那里，然后听着。然后他把她拖到了走廊。他说，坐在那。于是她就在那里坐了大概四到五个小时。然后他说，起来。于是她起来，然后她说，我看不见了。她的脸淤青。眼睛黑黑的。头已经肿的不行；像原来的两个脑袋那么大。我跟他说，让她去睡吧。他放她去睡了。
en:&quot;And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroomand he — he — every time he hit her, she would fall.And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly.I could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn&#39;t move.I didn&#39;t even go and see what was happening.I just sat there and listened.And then he put her in the hallway.He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours.And then he told her, get up.And when she got up, she says she couldn&#39;t see.Her face was bruised. She had a black eye.All around her head was just swollen;her head was about two sizes of its own size.I told him, &#39;Let her go to sleep.&#39; He let her go to sleep.

zh-cn:第二天早上她死了。他去叫她起床上学，然后他惊慌万分。他说，她没有呼吸了。我马上就意识到她已经死了。我甚至不愿去接受她已经死了的事实，于是我进去我拿着镜子放在她觜前—什么现象都没有，她嘴里没有呼出任何东西。他说道，他说，说，我们不能让任何人发现这个事情。他说，你得帮帮我。我同意，同意。
en:&quot;The next morning she was dead.He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.He says, &#39;She won&#39;t breathe.&#39;I knew immediately that she was dead.I didn&#39;t even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went inand I put a mirror to her mouth —there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth.He said, he said, he said,&#39;We can&#39;t, we can&#39;t let nobody find out about this.&#39;He say, &#39;You&#39;ve got to help me.&#39; I agree. I agree.
时间：10:48
zh-cn:我的意思是，我这么多年来不停的保守秘密，这对我来说已经不是什么新鲜的要求了，只要继续保密就行。于是我们走到大道告诉警察，她失踪了，她失踪了。我们告诉警卫说，她失踪了；尽管她根本没有失踪。我们告诉了警卫她的衣着样式我们回家以后就把她打扮的和对警卫描述中的样子一模一样。
en:&quot;I mean, I&#39;ve been keeping a secret for years and years and years,so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret.So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her,that she was missing.We told a security guard that she was missing,though she wasn&#39;t missing.And we told the security guard what we had put on herand we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thingthat we had told the security guard that we had put on her.

zh-cn:然后我们接走了婴儿和我的另一个孩子然后我们就开车，大概去 I-95 (纽泽西州)我是如此的僵硬和麻木了，然后我再后视镜中看。发现他把她正好摆在路肩（紧急停车道）那里。我的孩子啊，我竟然让这种事情发生在她身上。那么这就是关于负面幻想的一个调查。（掌声）
en:&quot;And then we got the baby and my other child,and we drove out to, like, I-95.I was so petrified and so numb,all I could look was in the rear-view mirror.And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.My own child, I let that happen to.&quot;So that&#39;s an investigation of the negative imagination.(Applause)

zh-cn:当我开始这项计划时叫做“在路上：寻找美国符号”以我的录音机为工具，我以为我要走遍整个美国探索形形色色的人物—骑牛者、牛仔、养猪农，乐队领队—不过在种族关系上我遇到了点麻烦，因为我的首次演出是关于种族暴乱的。因此两次种族暴动我都亲历，其中一次是在洛杉矶。那么下一个片段就来源于此。因为这个我想使我有对种族关系有了最透彻的了解，在这个片段。就仿佛是咏叹调，我认为，在我有过的许多录影中。
en:When I started this projectcalled &quot;On the Road: A Search For an American Character&quot;with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around Americaand find it in all its aspects — bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers,drum majorettes — but I sort of got tripped on race relations,because my first big show was a show about a race riot.And so I went to both — two race riots,one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that.Because this is what I would sayI&#39;ve learned the most about race relations, from this piece.It&#39;s a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.

zh-cn:大家都知道洛杉矶暴动的情况因为4个警察暴打了一个叫Rodney King的黑人。录像机拍摄下了这个画面—（这就是）科技—然后在全世界广为传播。所有人都认为4个警察肯定会进监狱。但是他们没有，于是就引发了暴乱。而且许多人忽略的是，那时候还有1个二审，被George Bush, Sr授权。然后审判的结果是两个警察进了监狱另两个警察被宣无罪。我当时在场。我的意思是，人们在街上欢呼雀跃因为他们担心会有另一场暴乱。而结果的改判使积压的喜悦爆发出来。
en:Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happenedbecause four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.It was captured on videotape — technology —and it was played all over the world.Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail.They did not, so there were riots.And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial,ordered by George Bush, Sr.And that trial came back with two cops going to jailand two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.And I mean, the people just danced in the streetsbecause they were afraid there was going to be another riot.Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.
时间：13:18
zh-cn:（但是）有一个群体却不这样认为—韩裔美国人，他们的商店在暴乱中被夷为平地。因此这个女性，Young-Soon Han女士，我认为她极大的加深了我对种族的认识。她也问到了Studs曾经谈到的问题：官方真相的概念，质疑什么是官方真相。因此她正在质疑，她尝试着冒险质疑在这个社会中什么是正义。这个（片段）叫做，“吞食苦果。”
en:So there was a community that didn&#39;t — the Korean-Americans,whose stores had been burned to the ground.And so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han,I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.And she asks also a question that Studs talks about:this notion of the &quot;official truth,&quot; to question the &quot;official truth.&quot;So what she&#39;s questioning here, she&#39;s taking a chanceand questioning what justice is in society.And this is called, &quot;Swallowing the Bitterness.&quot;
时间：13:45
zh-cn:我曾经相信美国是最好的。我在韩国看过许多描述好莱坞奢华生活方式的电影。我从没看到过穷人，黑人。直到1992年，我还相信美国是最好的—我始终相信，我并不否认这点因为我是一个受害者。不过在92年末，如此的暴乱时期，所有的财政问题接踵而至，以及精神层面的问题，我开始意识到韩国人完完全全的被这个社会抛弃，我们什么都不是。为什么？为什么我们被抛弃？我们没有接受医疗的资格，没有救济粮票，没有GR，
en:&quot;I used to believe America was the best.I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.I never saw any poor man, any black.Until 1992, I used to believe America was the best — I still do;I don&#39;t deny that because I am a victim.But at the end of &#39;92, when we were in such turmoil,and having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems,I began to really realize that Koreansare completely left out of this society and we are nothing.Why? Why do we have to be left out?We didn&#39;t qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR,
时间：14:40
zh-cn:没有福利，什么都没有，许多从不工作的非裔美国人可以得到维系生存的那一丁点补贴。我们什么都没有因为我们有车，有房。我们要支付高额的税金。我去哪找公平呢？好。好。好。好。也许很多非裔美国人会认为他们在这场审判中胜利了。在审判结束的那个早上，我坐在这里看着他们，一整天他们都在狂欢，庆祝，整个南部中心区，所有的教堂。他们说，哦，终于这个社会实现了正义。那么，受害人的权利呢？他们通过糟蹋无辜的韩国商人而获取自身的权利。他们对于Martin King博士，非常尊敬，就像我一样。他是黑人社会的唯一楷模；我才不管什么Jesse Jackson呢。他倡导的是非暴力，非暴力—而且他们似乎都同意这种精神。
en:no welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never workgot minimum amount of money to survive.We didn&#39;t get any because we have a car and a house.And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice?&quot;OK. OK? OK. OK.Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict,and all the day they were having a party, they celebrated,all of South Central, all the churches. And they say,&#39;Well, finally justice has been done in this society.&#39;Well, what about victims&#39; rights?They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King.He is the only model for black community; I don&#39;t care Jesse Jackson.He is the model of non-violence, non-violence —and they would all like to be in his spirit.
时间：16:16
zh-cn:那么1992年呢？他们迫害无辜的人。我怀疑这是否是真正的正义对他们而言，用这样的方式争取权利。我吞食着苦果，孤独一人坐在那里看着他们。他们喜洋洋的，不过我为他们高兴。我为他们欣喜。至少他们赢得了一些东西。就让我们先忘掉受害的韩国人和其他受害人吧被他们迫害的这些人。他们为了自己的权利奋斗了两个多世纪，而且也许是因为牺牲了少数，西班牙人，亚洲人，在主流社会中我们承受了更多痛苦。因此我明白了，因此我对于判决的结果如此百感交集。
en:&quot;But what about 1992? They destroyed innocent people.And I wonder if that is really justicefor them, to get their rights in that way.I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.They became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.I was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK.Let&#39;s just forget about Korean victims and other victimswho were destroyed by them.They fought for their rights for over two centuries,and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities,Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.That&#39;s why I understand;that&#39;s why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.

zh-cn:但是我希望，我希望，我希望我可以成为欢乐人群中的一份子。我希望我可以和黑人们生活在一起。但是暴乱之后，一切都大不一样了。大火还在那里。你怎么看？点燃，点燃，点起火，点起火来。它还未熄灭；它任何时候都可能燃起。（这就是）Young-Soon Han女士。（掌声）
en:&quot;But I wish that, I wish that, I wish thatI could be part of the enjoyment.I wish that I could live together with black people.But after the riot, it&#39;s too much difference.The fire is still there.

en:The other reason that I don&#39;t wear shoesis just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle upand get into the feet of somebody,walking really in somebody else&#39;s shoes.And I told you that in — you know, I didn&#39;t give you the year,but in &#39;79 I thought that I was going to go aroundand find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that,and I got sidetracked on race relations.

zh-cn:最终，我找到了一个骑牛人，两年前。我一直去看他的竞技表演，于是我们亲密起来。而且他是我的一个关于共和党大会的专栏的主角。他是共和党人—我不会讲出我的政治倾向的，不过无论如何—所以这就是我亲爱的，亲爱的Brent Williams，这是关于强悍，以防有人需要知道关于强悍的东西（因为）你做的工作。我认为这其中确实有值得学习的地方，这叫做“强悍。”
en:Finally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago.And I&#39;ve been going to the rodeos with him, and we&#39;ve bonded.And he&#39;s the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention.He&#39;s a Republican — I won&#39;t say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway —so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams,and this is on toughness,in case anybody needs to know about being toughfor the work that you do. I think there&#39;s a real lesson in this.And this is called &quot;Toughness.&quot;

zh-cn:噢，我是个乐天派。我的意思是我基本上是一个乐天派。我是说，你知道，我的意思是，我的妻子，Jolene，她的家人总是说，你总会认为他是一个天生的输家，似乎他遭遇了如此多的不幸，你知道。但是那头牛踩在了我的肾脏上面，你知道，我的肾脏还在—我本有可能失掉它，（不过）我逃过一劫，所以我不认为自己是个天生的输家。我认为这是好运气。（笑声）
en:&quot;Well, I&#39;m an optimist. I mean basically I&#39;m an optimist.I mean, you know, I mean, it&#39;s like my wife, Jolene,her family&#39;s always saying,you know, you ever think he&#39;s just a born loser?It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know,I didn&#39;t lose my kidney — I could have lost my kidney,I kept my kidney, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a born loser.I think that&#39;s good luck.(Laughter)

zh-cn:而且，我是说，这种有趣的事情时常发生。我在医生的办公室进行CAT扫描，看到一本读者文摘，2002年10月刊。好像讲到，其中赢得运气的方法。上面说到如果你想要走运，那么你必须要生活在积极的人中间。我的意思是，即使当我老婆告诉我你想要来这里和我谈话，她的样子是，一直说个不停，她只是在你面前装好人。她不是这样的人。
en:&quot;And, I mean, funny things like this happen.I was in a doctor&#39;s office last CAT scan,and there was a Reader&#39;s Digest, October 2002.It was like, &#39;seven ways to get lucky.&#39; And it saysif you want to get lucky,you know, you&#39;ve got to be around positive people.I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out hereand talk to me, she&#39;s like, &#39;She&#39;s just talking;she&#39;s just being nice to you. She&#39;s not going to do that.&#39;

zh-cn:然后你叫我来然后说你想要来这里采访我，然后她去网上搜索了你的信息。她说，瞧瞧她的来头。你甚至都回答不了她的问题。（笑）于是她说到你会使我看起来像白痴一样因为我从没上过大学，我也不会讲太专业的什么东西。我说，你看，这个女人和我谈了4个小时。你知道，如果我没有一直在说—你知道，好像，恩，她想要我张口，那么我不认为她会费劲跑来这里。
en:&quot;And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out hereand interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.She said, &#39;Look who she is.You&#39;re not even going to be able to answer her questions.&#39;(Laughter)And she was saying you&#39;re going to make me look like an idiotbecause I&#39;ve never been to college,and I wouldn&#39;t be talking professional or anything.I said, &#39;Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.You know, if I wasn&#39;t talking — you know,like, you know, she wanted me to talk,I don&#39;t think she would even come out here.&#39;

zh-cn:自信？噢，我认为骑牛需要更多的决心而不是自信。我是说，自信就好比，你知道，在你知道你能骑那头牛之前你就已经骑过它了。我是说，自信就好比变的骄傲自大，不过是好的方面。但是决心，你知道，就好比，你知道，“忘掉该死的规矩，制服那头牛就行了。”（笑声）这是Tuff Hedeman，在电影“8秒钟”的话。我的意思你，就像Pat O‘Mealey在我小的时候经常说，他说，你知道，你比其他孩子更有天赋。尝试和决心是一回事。决心就好像，你要一直坚持骑在牛上面，即使你颠簸摇晃。决心就好像，你一直骑下去直到你头发沾上了脏泥。
en:&quot;Confidence? Well, I think I ridemore out of determination than confidence.I mean, confidence is like, you know,you&#39;ve been on that bull before; you know you can ride him.I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.But determination, you know, it&#39;s like just, you know, &#39;Fuck the form,get the horn.&#39;(Laughter)That&#39;s Tuff Hedeman, in the movie &#39;8 Seconds.&#39;I mean, like, Pat O&#39;Mealey always said when I was a boy,he say, &#39;You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.&#39;And try and determination is the same thing.Determination is, like, you&#39;re going to hang on that bull,even if you&#39;re riding upside down.Determination&#39;s like, you&#39;re going to ridetill your head hits the back of the dirt.

zh-cn:自由？那肯定是竞技了。
en:&quot;Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo.
时间：21:18
zh-cn:美丽？我想我还不知道那是什么东西。噢，你知道，我想应该还是竞技吧。我是说，你看我们，强悍的一家人，互相结交朋友，互相握手，围着我格斗。就好像，你知道，把钱花在入场费和加油钱上面。我们一起骑，我们，你知道，我们，我们一起吃一起睡。我的意思是，我甚至都不能想象那会是什么样在我竞技的最后那天。我是说，我会没事的。我是说，我有自己的农场和一切，但是实际上我甚至不愿去设想那天会到来。我的意思是，我想就应该会是—就好像我哥哥死的那天的样子吧。
en:&quot;Beauty? I don&#39;t think I know what beauty is.Well, you know, I guess that&#39;d have to be the rodeo too.I mean, look how we are, the roughy family,palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me.It&#39;s like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat togetherand we sleep together.I mean, I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s going to be likethe last day I rodeo. I mean, I&#39;ll be alright.I mean, I have my ranch and everything,but I actually don&#39;t even want to think the day that comes.I mean, I guess it just be like —I guess it be like the day my brother died.

zh-cn:强悍？噢，我们在犹他州的西约旦，这头公牛直接用金属一下子给我的脸重重一击—你知道，把我的脸打的乱七八糟于是我不得不去医院。而且他们不能不把我缝起来，弄直我的鼻子。而且我那晚上还要去竞技场再去骑牛，所以我不想让他们给我用麻醉药，或者其他的这种东西。于是他们把我的脸缝好。然后把鼻子拉出来弄直，他们取出里面的小东西然后推平我的鼻子向上穿过我的脑袋就好像从我的脑袋尖上冒出来一样，所有人都说这能让我完蛋的，但我没有，我想可能是我对痛苦有比较好的承受力吧。（笑声）不过好的消息是，一旦他们把我的鼻骨扶直弄平我的鼻子，我可以呼吸了，我自从高中竞技的时候把鼻子弄断就再也没能用它呼吸过。
en:&quot;Toughness? Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bullshoved my face right through the metal shoots in a —you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital.And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night,so I didn&#39;t want them to put me under anesthesia,or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up.And then they had to straighten out my nose,and they took these rods and shoved them up my noseand went up through my brainsand felt like it was coming out the top of my head,and everybody said that it should have killed me,but it didn&#39;t, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.(Laughter)But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up thereand straightened my nose out, I could breathe,and I hadn&#39;t been able to breathesince I broke my nose in the high school rodeo.&quot;
