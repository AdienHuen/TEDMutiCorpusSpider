en:It turns out that what this stuff is —and Richard Dawkins has written about this —is, this is really a river out of Eden.So, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cellsis really a history of where you&#39;ve been for the past billion years.And we could start dating things,and we could start changing medicine and archeology.It turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.White Europeans were subject to the plague.And when they were subject to the plague, most people didn&#39;t survive,but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.And that mutation was passed on to their kidsbecause they&#39;re the ones that survived,so there was a great deal of population pressure.In Africa, because you didn&#39;t have these cities,you didn&#39;t have that CCR5 population pressure mutation.We can date it to 700 years ago.That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is,and not as fast across Europe.And we&#39;re beginning to find these little things for malaria,for sickle cell, for cancers.And in the measure that we map ourselves,this is the single greatest adventure that we&#39;ll ever be on.And this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine,and I want you to toast these two people.Because this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,and that is almost as important a dateas the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves,but anyway, we&#39;ll get to that.

This is the amoeba dubia.And the amoeba dubia doesn&#39;t look like much,except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,which is what makes you you,as far as gene code inside each of your cells,and this little amoeba which, you know,sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.So, this little thingamajig has a genomethat&#39;s 200 times the size of yours.And if you&#39;re thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,it may not turn out to be chips.It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.

en:This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma.The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron,lives inside the equivalent of battery acid,and excretes sulfuric acid.So, when you think of odd life forms,when you think of what it takes to live,it turns out this is a very efficient life form,and they call it an archaea. Archaea means &quot;the ancient ones.&quot;And the reason why they&#39;re ancient is because this thing came upwhen this planet was coveredby things like sulfuric acid in batteries,and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.So, it&#39;s not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphinsthat you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.

The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo.But it turns out that as we learn more about gene codeand how to reprogram species,we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.And when we learn how to close the gene gaps,then we can put a full string of DNA together.And if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf&#39;s egg,we may give birth to an animalthat hasn&#39;t walked the earth since 1936.And then you can start going back further,and you can start thinking about dodos,and you can think about other species.And in other places, like Maryland, they&#39;re trying to figure outwhat the primordial ancestor is.Because each of us contains our entire gene codeof where we&#39;ve been for the past billion years,because we&#39;ve evolved from that stuff,you can take that tree of life and collapse it back,and in the measure that you learn to reprogram,maybe we&#39;ll give birth to somethingthat is very close to the first primordial ooze.And it&#39;s all coming out of things that look like this.

en:Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but —oh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous.What&#39;s the net effect of this?In an agricultural society, the difference betweenthe richest and the poorest,the most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why?Because in agriculture, if you had 10 kidsand you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder,you could produce about five times more wealth, on average,than your neighbor.In a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1.It really matters if you&#39;re literate, not just in reading and writingin English and French and German,but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple.And very soon it&#39;s going to matter if you&#39;re literate in life code.So, if there is something you should fear,it&#39;s that you&#39;re not keeping your eye on the ball.Because it really matters who speaks life.That&#39;s why nations rise and fall.

zh-cn:如果时光倒退到1870年间人均产能最高的国家是澳大利亚后来是新西兰，1950年左右是美国1973年则是瑞士，然后美国再次崛起击败瑞士大家都知道当今产能最高的国家是卢森堡，人均年产量比美国多1/3而它是个小内陆国家，没有石油、钻石、天然资源仅仅靠聪明的国民一点点积累发展成现在的样子。这是个例
en:And it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s,the most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person.And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950,and then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top —beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks.And today, of course, you all know that the most productive nationon earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealthper person per year than America.Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.Just smart people moving bits. Different rules.

zh-cn:这里显示的是不同国家的生产率差别这里显示的是获得一个美国专利需要多少人美国需要3000个人，韩国需要6000个人，英国需要14000个人，阿根廷需要790000个人，你们知道阿根廷为什么崩溃么？不是因为通货膨胀不是因为私有化你可以让一个受过哈佛教育的毕业自常春藤联合会的经济学家来掌管阿根廷，它照样会崩溃因为经济学家不知道其中规则是如何改变的对了，发明一个美国专利，需要560万印度人让我们看看印度又是怎么回事印度和中国队世界经济的贡献曾达到40%不过只是在工业革命期间，现在只占到4.8%两国合起来有20亿人口，占世界人口的1/3，产生的财富仅占世界的5%因为他们没有顺势而变因为统治者把他们的国民看做是农奴而不是具有共同利益的投资人统治者不懂得留住受过教育的人才不刺激商业发展，不做上市但硅谷懂得这么做，这是为什么硅谷因为懂得网罗人才而取得不断的发展而不是像印度或中国那样单单去发展集成电路(笑)
en:Here&#39;s differential productivity rates.Here&#39;s how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.So, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits,790,000 Argentines. You want to know why Argentina&#39;s crashing?It&#39;s got nothing to do with inflation.It&#39;s got nothing to do with privatization.You can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist,stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the countrybecause he doesn&#39;t understand how the rules have changed.Oh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians.Well, watch what happens to India.India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economyjust at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.Two billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealthbecause they didn&#39;t get this change,because they kept treating their people like serfsinstead of like shareholders of a common project.They didn&#39;t keep the people who were educated.They didn&#39;t foment the businesses. They didn&#39;t do the IPOs.Silicon Valley did. And that&#39;s why they saythat Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs.Not integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese.(Laughter)

zh-cn:世界都发生了什么如果你1950年去联合国即联合国成立的时间，世界上有50个国家而现在有192个国家这些国家一个接着一个分裂，分离，兴盛，衰落变得支离破碎，但同样的故事仍然在上演这些主权国家在1990年之前并不存在这并不包括国家之间的融合，或者是国家改名，或者是国旗的更改每年有3.12个国家产生人民掌管着各自的国家有时候朝着更好的方向发展，有时候则陷入糟糕的境地非常有意思的一点你和你的子孙有能力建立大帝国不需要多费劲就能搞定(音乐)音乐播完了，现在我要谈谈如何通过研究生命赚钱以及遗传密码是如何运作的(计时人：超时两分钟)(笑)现在我不说了，明年再继续因为我不想占用劳比的时间谢谢大家
en:Here&#39;s what&#39;s happening in the world.It turns out that if you&#39;d gone to the U.N. in 1950,when it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.It turns out there&#39;s now about 192.Country after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing —and it&#39;s all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.In the 1990s, these are sovereign statesthat did not exist before 1990.And this doesn&#39;t include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.We&#39;re generating about 3.12 states per year.People are taking control of their own states,sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.And the really interesting thing is,you and your kids are empowered to build great empires,and you don&#39;t need a lot to do it.(Music)And, given that the music is over, I was going to talkabout how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,and how code works.Moderator: Two minutes.(Laughter)Juan Enriquez: No, I&#39;m going to stop there and we&#39;ll do it next yearbecause I don&#39;t want to take any of Laurie&#39;s time.But thank you very much.
