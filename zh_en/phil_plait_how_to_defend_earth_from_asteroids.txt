zh-cn:我想和大家探讨一样东西一个庞然大物我们先从这里讲起6500万年前恐龙们倒了大霉了（众人笑）一块长达6英里的巨石以出膛子弹50倍的速度向前运行当头撞上了地球一时间 它释放出了所有能量爆炸所产生的威力令人无法想象如果将冷战最紧张时期所有核武器堆成一堆再同时引爆所产生的威力充其量还只是其百万分之一恐龙们真是倒了大霉了对吧
en:I want to talk to you about somethingkind of big.We&#39;ll start here.65 million years agothe dinosaurs had a bad day.(Laughter)A chunk of rock six miles across,moving something like 50 timesthe speed of a rifle bullet,slammed into the Earth.It released its energy all at once,and it was an explosion that wasmind-numbing.If you took every nuclear weapon ever builtat the height of the Cold War,lumped them together and blew them upat the same time,that would be one one-millionthof the energy released at that moment.The dinosaurs had a really bad day.Okay?

zh-cn:一块6英里宽的巨石非常大我们都住在Boulder市从窗外看去 你可以看见朗斯峰 你们对这山都不陌生吧把朗斯峰连锅端起来把它放到外太空把米克山也拔起来放到外太空去再加上珠穆朗玛峰 乔戈里峰印第安山脉群峰现在你们应该可以想象这块巨石有多大了吧我们从爆炸释放的威力和之后留下的陨坑得知这块巨石的确有这么大它所撞击的地点是现位于墨西哥湾的尤卡坦你可以看这里如果你认得东海岸的科祖梅尔岛这里就是尤卡坦半岛
en:Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.We all live here in Boulder.If you look out your window and you can seeLong&#39;s Peak, you&#39;re probably familiar with it.Now, scoop up Long&#39;s Peak, and put it outin space.Take Meeker, Mt. Meeker. Lump that in there,and put that in space as well,and Mt. Everest, and K2,and the Indian peaks.Then you&#39;re starting to get an idea ofhow much rock we&#39;re talking about, okay?We know it was that big because ofthe impact it had and the crater it left.It hit in what we now know as Yucatan,the Gulf of Mexico.You can see here, there&#39;s theYucatan Peninsula, if you recognize Cozumeloff the east coast there.

zh-cn:留下的陨坑有这么大它非常大 你可以估计一下它的大小你看它上面宽50英里下面宽100公里跨度为300公里 也就是200英里这个巨大的陨坑把大量泥土掘起 抛散开来 尘土弥漫整个地球四处起火烟尘遮盖了阳光地球上75%的物种就此灭绝并不是所有小行星都这么大有些小行星或陨石体型较小这是1992年10月砸到美国的一块陨石那是一个星期五的晚上这为什么值得一提当时摄影机才刚开始普及人们都随身携带 家长们带着摄影机去拍摄孩子的足球比赛这颗陨石在一个周五从天而降划过西弗吉尼亚州 马里兰州宾夕法尼亚洲 新泽西州一路解体直到它砸在纽约州的一辆车上人们就把这一壮景拍了下来（众人笑）
en:Here is how big of a crater was left.It was huge. To give you a sense of the scale,okay, there you go. The scale here is50 miles on top, a hundred kilometerson the bottom. This thing was300 kilometers across — 200 miles —an enormous crater that excavated outvast amounts of earth that splashed aroundthe globe and set fires all over the planet,threw up enough dust to block out the sun.It wiped out 75 percent of all specieson Earth.Now, not all asteroids are that big.Some of them are smaller.Here is one that came inover the United Statesin October of 1992.It came in on a Friday night.Why is that important?Because back then, video cameras werejust starting to become popular, and peoplewould bring them, parents would bring them,to their kids&#39; football games to film their kidsplay football. And since this came in on a Friday,they were able to get this great footageof this thing breaking up as it came inover West Virgina, Maryland, Pennsylvaniaand New Jersey until it did thatto a car in New York.(Laughter)

zh-cn:它没有形成一个200英里宽的陨坑但是你看那块陨石落在地上大概有一个橄榄球大小能把那车砸成那样这块陨石在刚进入大气层时大概有一辆公共汽车那么大它在大气层中摩擦燃烧解体 碎片四散造成了一些破坏你可不想被这些家伙砸到脚或头因为一被砸到就糟糕了但至少它不会毁灭地球上所有的生命 所以问题不大然而 即使是体型小于6英里宽的小行星陨石也能造成巨大的破坏在小石块和巨石之间存在一个中间点你们可能有人去过亚利桑那州的温斯洛那里附近的沙漠里就有一个陨坑这个著名的陨坑就叫做“陨石坑”
en:Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,but then again you can see the rockwhich is sitting right here,about the size of a football, that hitthat car and did that damage.Now this thing was probably about the sizeof a school bus when it first came in.It broke up through atmospheric pressure,it crumbled, and then the pieces fell apartand did some damage.Now, you wouldn&#39;t want that falling on your footor your head, because it would do that to it.That would be bad.But it won&#39;t wipe out, you know, all lifeon Earth, so that&#39;s fine. But it turns out,you don&#39;t need something six miles acrossto do a lot of damage.There is a median point between tiny rockand gigantic rock, and in fact, if any of youhave ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,there is a crater in the desert there that isso iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater.

zh-cn:它大概有一英里宽往上看 那是一个停车场那些房车就停放在那里它大约1英里宽 600英尺深陨石的大小大概为30到50码宽大概有这个礼堂这么大它的飞行速度极快撞入地表 爆炸释放的能量相当于一枚20兆吨的核弹一枚相当给力的炸弹这发生在5万年前当时可能也就消灭了沙漠上的几头野牛或羚羊可能不会造成全球性的灾难
en:To give you a sense of scale, this is about a mile wide.If you look up at the top, that&#39;s a parking lot,and those are recreational vehicles right there.So it&#39;s about a mile across, 600 feet deep.The object that formed this was probably about30 to 50 yards across, so roughly the sizeof Mackey Auditorium here.It came in at speeds that were tremendous,slammed into the ground, blew up,and exploded with the energy of roughlya 20-megaton nuclear bomb —a very hefty bomb.This was 50,000 years ago, so it may havewiped out a few buffalo or antelope,or something like that out in the desert,but it probably would not have causedglobal devastation.

zh-cn:陨石即使没有砸到地面也会造成巨大的破坏1908年在西伯利亚靠近通古斯卡河流域—大家可能有人是Dan Aykroyd的粉丝 看过“捉鬼敢死队”他谈到过1909年西伯利亚大爆炸后出现的大裂谷他当时把时间说错了不过没关系（众人笑）应该是1908年 没事儿 我可以忍受（众人笑）另一块陨石进入了大气层在距地表几英里的地方爆炸爆炸产生的热将下面的森林点燃冲击波将几百平方英里的森林夷为平地这造成了巨大的破坏这块陨石大概有我们这个礼堂这么大
en:It turns out that these things don&#39;t have tohit the ground to do a lot of damage.Now, in 1908, over Siberia, near theTunguska region — for those of you who areDan Aykroyd fans and saw &quot;Ghostbusters,&quot;when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional riftsince the Siberia blast of 1909, where he gotthe date wrong, but that&#39;s okay. (Laughter)It was 1908. That&#39;s fine. I can live with that.(Laughter)Another rock came into the Earth&#39;s atmosphereand this one blew up above the ground, severalmiles up above the surface of the Earth.The heat from the explosion set fire to theforest below it, and then the shock wavecame down and knocked down trees forhundreds of square miles, okay?This did a huge amount of damage.And again, this was a rock probably roughlythe size of this auditorium that we&#39;re sitting in.

zh-cn:形成陨石坑的陨石由金属组成金属较为坚固因此最终到达了地面经过通古斯上空的那颗陨石可能是由石头组成的 比较脆所以在空中爆炸了 而这两颗陨石都造成了20兆吨的巨大爆炸这样的陨石爆炸不会造成全球性的生态破坏它们不会像灭绝恐龙的那颗小行星那样造成如此严重的破坏它们不够大但它们可以造成全球性的经济破坏因为它们即使不着地也能造成这样的破坏它们即使不造成全球性的灾难 也能达到破坏的效果任何一颗陨石要是即将撞上地球不管撞在哪里 都会引起恐慌如果它经过一个城市 一个重要的城市我不是说一个城市比其它城市重要但是我们在全球经济层面上更依赖某些城市这会对我们的文明造成巨大破坏
en:In Meteor Crater it was made of metal,and metal is much tougher, so it made itto the ground.The one over Tunguska was probably madeof rock, and that&#39;s much more crumbly, so itblew up in the air. Either way, these aretremendous explosions, 20 megatons.Now, when these things blow up, they&#39;re notgoing to do global ecological damage.They&#39;re not going to do something likethe dinosaur-killer did.They&#39;re just not big enough.But they will do global economic damage,because they don&#39;t have to hit, necessarily,to do this kind of damage.They don&#39;t have to do global devastation.If one of these things were to hitpretty much anywhere, it would cause a panic.But if it came over a city, an important city —not that any city is more important than others,but some of them we depend on them moreon the global economic basis — that could doa huge amount of damage to usas a civilization.

zh-cn:我把你们都吓趴下了吧（众人笑）我们怎么办呢这是个潜在的威胁我提醒你们一下我们已经有6500万年没有遭遇灭绝恐龙的小行星造成的那种破坏了 这非常罕见体积较小的小行星袭击地球的次数稍多一些但也就一千年几百年或几千年发生一次但这还是值得引起注意我们怎么对付它们我们首先要把它们找出来这是2009年经过地球的一颗小行星就在这里可以看到 它非常暗我都不确定坐在后排的观众能否看到这些只是星星这是一颗直径约为30码的陨石它的大小和在通古斯上空爆炸的小行星以及5万年前砸到亚利桑那州的小行星差不多
en:So, now that I&#39;ve scared the crap out of you ...(Laughter)what can we do about this? All right?This is a potential threat.Let me note that we have not hada giant impact like the dinosaur-killerfor 65 million years. They&#39;re very rare.The smaller ones happen more often, butprobably on the order of a millennium,every few centuries or every few thousandyears, but it&#39;s still something to be aware of.Well, what do we do about them?The first thing we have to do is find them.This is an image of an asteroid that passedus in 2009.It&#39;s right here.But you can see that it&#39;s extremely faint.I don&#39;t even know if you can see thatin the back row. These are just stars.This is a rock that was about 30 yards across,so roughly the size of the ones that blew upover Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.

en:These things are faint.They&#39;re hard to see, and the sky is really big.We have to find these things first.Well the good news is, we&#39;re looking for them.NASA has devoted money to this.The National Science Foundation, othercountries are very interested in doing this.We&#39;re building telescopes that are lookingfor the threat. That&#39;s a great first step,but what&#39;s the second step? The second stepis that we see one heading toward us,we have to stop it. What do we do?You&#39;ve probably heard about the asteroidApophis. If you haven&#39;t yet, you will.If you&#39;ve heard about the Mayan 2012apocalypse, you&#39;re going to hear about Apophis,because you&#39;re keyed in to all the doomsdaynetworks anyway.

zh-cn:阿波菲斯是2004年被发现的一颗小行星它的直径约为250码可见它的个头可不小它比一个足球场还大它将于2029年4月飞过地球上空它将非常接近地球会从我们的气象卫星下面飞过去而地心引力会使它的运行轨道发生弯曲如果这正好使它穿过这个区域这个蚕豆形状的区域我们称钥匙眼 地心引力会使其轨道弯曲这样它在七年之后也就是2036年4月13日星期五这一天（众人笑）这种事情可没法作安排阿波菲斯会在这天撞上地球它的直径为250码后果将不堪设想
en:Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004.It&#39;s roughly 250 yards across, so it&#39;spretty big — big size, you know,bigger than a football stadium — and it&#39;s going topass by the Earth in April of 2029.And it&#39;s going to pass us so close that it&#39;sactually going to come underneathour weather satellites.The Earth&#39;s gravity is going to bend the orbitof this thing so much that if it&#39;s just right,if it passes through this region of space,this kidney bean-shaped region calledthe keyhole, the Earth&#39;s gravity will bend itjust enough that seven years lateron April 13, which is a Friday, I&#39;ll note,in the year 2036 ... (Laughter)— you can&#39;t plan that kind of stuff —Apophis is going to hit us. And it&#39;s250 meters across, so it would dounbelievable damage.

zh-cn:值得庆幸的是它穿过这个钥匙眼撞上地球的几率为百万分之一几率非常非常低反正我可不会为了它而辗转反侧睡不着我们不需要太担心阿波菲斯阿波菲斯其实是件好事因为 它提醒了我们要注意这些小行星的威胁我们几年前发现了这颗小行星它有可能在几年后与地球相撞它不会撞上地球 但它让我们有机会研究这些小行星我们之前对这些钥匙眼并不了解现在我们有所了解了并知道其中的重大意义要不我们如何阻止这样一颗小行星呢
en:Now the good news is that the odds of itactually passing through this keyhole andhitting us next go-around are one in a million,roughly — very, very low odds, so I personallyam not lying awake at night worrying about this at all.I don&#39;t think Apophis is a problem.In fact, Apophis is a blessing in disguise,because it woke us up to the dangersof these things.This thing was discovered just a few yearsago and could hit us a few years from now.It won&#39;t, but it gives us a chance to studythese kinds of asteroids. We didn&#39;t reallynecessarily understand these keyholes, andnow we do and it turns outthat&#39;s really important, because how do youstop an asteroid like this?

zh-cn:我问你们 如果你站在路中间一辆车朝你驶来 会有什么情况发生你会怎么做 你会这么做挪开 对吧 让车过去但是 我们不能挪动地球就算要挪也没那么容易 但我们挪开那颗小行星其实 我们已经这么做过了2005年 NASA发射了一个名为&quot;天地大冲撞&quot;的探测器探测器的一部分嵌入了一颗彗星的内核彗星跟小行星十分相似这么做目的不是为了把它推出轨道而是为了制造一个陨坑从彗星表面刨出一些物质接着对物质进行深入研究我们的确将那颗彗星挪动了一点点但这不是重点但是 我们这样想这个天体围绕着太阳以每秒10英里 20英里的速度运行我们把一个太空探测器发射过去并击中了它想象一下 这有多困难 但我们做到了这意味着 我们还能这么做
en:Well, let me ask you, what happens if you&#39;restanding in the middle of the road and a car&#39;sheaded for you? What do you do? You do this.Right? Move. The car goes past you.But we can&#39;t move the Earth, at leastnot easily, but we can move a small asteroid.And it turns out, we&#39;ve even done it.In the year 2005, NASA launched a probecalled Deep Impact, which slammed into —slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet.Comets are very much like asteroids.The purpose wasn&#39;t to push it out of the way.The purpose was to make a crater to excavatethe material and see what was underneaththe surface of this comet, which we learnedquite a bit about.We did move the comet a little tiny bit,not very much, but that wasn&#39;t the point.However, think about this.This thing is orbiting the sun at10 miles per second, 20 miles per second.We shot a space probe at it and hit it. Okay?Imagine how hard that must be, and we did it.That means we can do it again.

zh-cn:如果有必要 如果看到一颗小行星飞来正朝着我们飞过来我们还有两年的时间 砰！击中它我们可以试试看 如果你看电影你可能会想为什么我们不用核武器呢你可以尝试用核武器 但是发射时间很成问题对这样的天体发射核弹你必须在几毫秒之内锁定目标否则你就会脱靶这里面有很多问题操作相当困难但想要打中一个物体 是轻而易举的连NASA都办得到他们以实力证明了这一点 （众人笑）问题是 如果击中了这颗小行星它的轨道改变了 会发生什么情况你测量了它的轨道 结果发现呀 正好 我们把它推到钥匙眼里了它三年后就要撞地球了
en:If we need, if we see an asteroid that&#39;s comingtoward us, and it&#39;s headed right for us,and we have two years to go, boom! We hit it.You can try to — you know, if you watchthe movies, you might think about,why don&#39;t we use a nuclear weapon?It&#39;s like, well, you can try that, but the problem is timing.You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,you have to blow it up within a few millisecondsof tolerance or else you&#39;ll just miss it.And there are a lot of other problemswith that. It&#39;s very hard to do.But just hitting something? That&#39;s pretty easy.I think even NASA can do that,and they proved that they can. (Laughter)The problem is, what happens if you hitthis asteroid, you&#39;ve changed the orbit,you measure the orbit and then you find out,oh, yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole,and now it&#39;s going to hit us in three years.

en:Well, my opinion is, fine. Okay?It&#39;s not hitting us in six months. That&#39;s good.Now we have three years to do something else.And you can hit it again. That&#39;s kind ofham-fisted. You might just push it into a thirdkeyhole or whatever, so you don&#39;t do that.And this is the part, it&#39;s the part I just love.(Laughter)After the big macho &quot;Rrrrrrr BAM! We&#39;regonna hit this thing in the face,&quot;then we bring in the velvet gloves.(Laughter)There&#39;s a group of scientists and engineersand astronauts and they call themselvesThe B612 Foundation.

Dan Durda, my friendwho made this image, works here atSouthwest Research Institute in Boulder,on Walnut Street. He created this image for this,and he&#39;s actually one of the astronomerswho works for them. If we see an asteroidthat&#39;s going to hit the Earth and we haveenough time, we can hit it to move it intoa better orbit. But then what we do is we launcha probe that has to weigh a ton or two.It doesn&#39;t have to be huge — couple of tons,not that big — and you park it near the asteroid.You don&#39;t land on it, because these things aretumbling end over end.
