zh-cn:我给大家讲个故事这个故事在我写新书的时候让我很着迷它发生在3000年前那时以色列王国才刚刚诞生这个故事发生在一个叫示非拉的地方就是现在的以色列这个故事让我着迷的原因是我以为我读懂了，但当我再回顾时我发现我一点也没读懂这个故事
en:So I wanted to tell a storythat really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,and it&#39;s a story of something that happened3,000 years ago,when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.And it takes place in an area called the Shephelahin what is now Israel.And the reason the story obsessed me is thatI thought I understood it, and then I went back over itand I realized that I didn&#39;t understand it at all.

zh-cn:在古代巴勒斯坦的东部边界有一条山脉今天的以色列也还有这条山脉这片区域的所有古城都在这条山脉里比如耶路撒冷，伯利恒，希伯伦然后沿着地中海还有一个海岸平原，就是现在的特拉维夫市连接这条山脉和海岸平原的地方就叫做示非拉实际上就是一连串东西走向的山谷山脊你可以穿过示非拉从海岸平原到山里去如果你去过以色列，你就会知道示非拉算是以色列最美的地方了十分漂亮，有橡树林有麦田，还有葡萄园
en:Ancient Palestine had a — along its eastern border,there&#39;s a mountain range.Still same is true of Israel today.And in the mountain range are all of the ancient citiesof that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.And then there&#39;s a coastal plainalong the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plainis an area called the Shephelah,which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelahto get from the coastal plain to the mountains.And the Shephelah, if you&#39;ve been to Israel, you&#39;ll knowit&#39;s just about the most beautiful part of Israel.It&#39;s gorgeous, with forests of oakand wheat fields and vineyards.

zh-cn:更重要的是，这片区域在历史上起着战略性的作用也就是说，海岸平原上的敌人可以通过这里登上山脉，威胁到山里的居民而在3000年前，确实发生了这种事腓力斯人，是以色列王国最大的敌人他们住在海岸平原上他们祖先来自克里特岛，是航海的民族他们会通过示非拉的一条山谷进入到山里因为他们想占领伯利恒旁边那片高原地区将以色列王国一分为二当时以色列王国的国王，索尔已经提前收到风声所以索尔带着他的军队下山在示非拉最美的山谷之一 — 以拉谷遭遇腓力斯人然后以色列人沿着北边的山脊掘壕固守腓力斯人则守在南边的山脊双方僵持了数周大眼瞪小眼，因为他们都陷入僵局了谁都无法攻击到对方，因为如果要攻击对方就得先从山脊下到山谷里来然后再上到对方那里去，这样就完全暴露了自己
en:But more importantly, though, in the history of that region,it&#39;s served, it&#39;s had a real strategic function,and that is, it is the means by which hostile armieson the coastal plain find their way,get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.And 3,000 years ago, that&#39;s exactly what happens.The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemiesof the Kingdom of Israel,are living in the coastal plain.They&#39;re originally from Crete. They&#39;re a seafaring people.And they may start to make their waythrough one of the valleys of the Shephelahup into the mountains,because what they want to do is occupy the highland arearight by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,obviously catches wind of this,and Saul brings his army down from the mountainsand he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,and the two armies just sit there for weeksand stare at each other, because they&#39;re deadlocked.Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other sideyou&#39;ve got to come down the mountain into the valleyand then up the other side, and you&#39;re completely exposed.

zh-cn:所以最后，为了打破僵局腓力斯人派出了他们最勇猛的战士来到了山谷里，大声叫喊他对以色列人挑衅“把你们最强的战士叫下来就我们俩，来决一死战。”
en:So finally, to break the deadlock,the Philistines send their mightiest warriordown into the valley floor, and he calls outand he says to the Israelites,&quot;Send your mightiest warrior down,and we&#39;ll have this out, just the two of us.&quot;
时间： 2:55
zh-cn:这是古代战争的一种传统，叫单一作战它可以解决纠纷避免战争中血流成河的局面腓力斯人派出的是他们最强壮的战士，是个巨人身高接近2米1他从头到脚都装备着闪亮的青铜铠甲手持利剑和标枪还有一支矛，威风凛凛他太可怕了，以至于没有一个以色列战士敢去迎战这不找死吗，对吧？他们觉得肯定打不赢他
en:This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.It was a way of settling disputeswithout incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.And the Philistine who is sent down,their mighty warrior, is a giant.He&#39;s 6 foot 9.He&#39;s outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,and he&#39;s got a sword and he&#39;s got a javelinand he&#39;s got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.And he&#39;s so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.It&#39;s a death wish, right? There&#39;s no way they think they can take him.
时间： 3:31
zh-cn:最后唯一一个自告奋勇的人是个牧童他走到索尔面前，说，“我去会会他。”
en:And finally the only person who will come forwardis this young shepherd boy,and he goes up to Saul and he says, &quot;I&#39;ll fight him.&quot;
时间： 3:39
zh-cn:索尔说，“你打不过的，别闹了你只是个小孩，对方可是猛将啊。”
en:And Saul says, &quot;You can&#39;t fight him. That&#39;s ridiculous.You&#39;re this kid. This is this mighty warrior.&quot;
时间： 3:44
zh-cn:但这个牧童很固执，连说，“不不不，你不知道，我为了保护我的羊群经常和狮子狼群周旋，我可以的。”
en:But the shepherd is adamant. He says, &quot;No, no, no,you don&#39;t understand, I have been defending my flockagainst lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it.&quot;
时间： 3:54
zh-cn:索尔没办法，因为除了他，没人敢去了所以他同意了，“好吧。”然后又转身对这牧童，说“但你得穿上这铠甲，你不能就这么去。”
en:And Saul has no choice. He&#39;s got no one else who&#39;s come forward.So he says, &quot;All right.&quot;And then he turns to the kid, and he says,&quot;But you&#39;ve got to wear this armor. You can&#39;t go as you are.&quot;
时间： 4:03
zh-cn:然后就准备给他穿上铠甲这是牧童拒绝了，“不。”他说，“我不穿这个。”圣经中的原话是，“吾，未曾披甲而战，故，不着甲。”意思就是，“我从来就没穿过铠甲，万一不适应怎办。”
en:So he tries to give the shepherd his armor,and the shepherd says, &quot;No.&quot;He says, &quot;I can&#39;t wear this stuff.&quot;The Biblical verse is, &quot;I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,&quot;meaning, &quot;I&#39;ve never worn armor before. You&#39;ve got to be crazy.&quot;
时间： 4:17
zh-cn:然后他就蹲到地上捡了五颗石子放进了他的牧羊包里然后就下山找巨人去了巨人看到他来了挑衅说，“过来吧，我要把你的肉献给天上的鸟儿和地里的野兽。”他对这个前来和他单挑的年轻人大肆嘲讽牧童越来越接近巨人了而巨人看到他只扛着一根牧羊棒他只带了这个没有武器，只有这根牧羊棒然后巨人就羞辱他“我是条狗吗？你拿这些打狗棒来干啥啊？”
en:So he reaches down instead on the groundand picks up five stonesand puts them in his shepherd&#39;s bagand starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.And the giant sees this figure approaching,and calls out, &quot;Come to me so I can feed your fleshto the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field.&quot;He issues this kind of taunt towards this personcoming to fight him.And the shepherd draws closer and closer,and the giant sees that he&#39;s carrying a staff.That&#39;s all he&#39;s carrying.Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd&#39;s staff,and he says — he&#39;s insulted —&quot;Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?&quot;
时间： 4:58
zh-cn:这时牧童从他的袋子里取出了一块石头，放在他的投石绳上抡了几圈绳子，然后甩出了石头石头直直地砸在巨人的眉间那里是他最脆弱的部位巨人应声而倒，也不知是死了还是晕了牧童就赶紧跑过去，拿起他的剑把他的头砍了下来腓力斯人见状，都吓得促慌而逃
en:And the shepherd boy takes one of his stonesout of his pocket, puts it in his slingand rolls it around and lets it flyand it hits the giant right between the eyes —right here, in his most vulnerable spot —and he falls down either dead or unconscious,and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his swordand cuts off his head,and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.

zh-cn:这个巨人的名字，叫做哥利亚而这个牧童，叫做大卫在我写书的过程中这个故事之所以让我着迷就是因为我发现自己对这个故事的理解都是错的
en:And of course, the name of the giant is Goliathand the name of the shepherd boy is David,and the reason that story has obsessed meover the course of writing my bookis that everything I thought I knew about that storyturned out to be wrong.
时间： 5:41
zh-cn:在这个故事里，大卫是不被看好的，对吧？事实上，“大卫和哥利亚”这个短语已经被我们用来比喻出人意料的胜利以弱胜强那么我们为什么不看好大卫呢？首先我们不看好他，因为他是个孩子只是个小孩，而哥利亚是强壮的巨人所以我们不看好他哥利亚可是个英勇善战的战士大卫只是个牧童罢了但我们不看好他的最重要的原因是哥利亚全身上下都武装着先进的武器装备闪亮的青铜铠甲利剑，标枪和长矛而大卫就只有一条投石绳
en:So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?In fact, that term, David and Goliath,has entered our language as a metaphor forimprobable victoriesby some weak party over someone far stronger.Now why do we call David an underdog?Well, we call him an underdog because he&#39;s a kid,a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.We also call him an underdogbecause Goliath is an experienced warrior,and David is just a shepherd.But most importantly, we call him an underdogbecause all he has is — it&#39;s that Goliath is outfitted withall of this modern weaponry,this glittering coat of armorand a sword and a javelin and a spear,and all David has is this sling.
时间： 6:30
zh-cn:我们再看一下这句话“大卫就只有一条投石绳，”这就是我们所犯的第一个错误所在在古代战争中，有三种士兵一是骑兵，驾车骑在马背上二是重步兵，就是步兵武装上剑和盾还有铠甲第三则是炮兵，这里指弓兵还有不容忽视的投石兵投石兵的武器，就是一个皮囊两端有长绳系着他们把石弹或铅弹放进皮囊然后像这样挥舞着再放掉一根绳就可以把弹物抛出击中目标大卫用的就是这个，但必须强调一点投石绳并不是弹弓不是这样的，对吧？它不是个玩具它其实是十分致命的武器当大卫这样抛旋的时候速度大约可以达到每秒六到七圈这就意味着，当石头被释放出去的时候它的速度是非常快的大概每秒35米这比最好的棒球手投出的球的速度快得多另外，以拉谷的石头不是普通的石头，他们是硫酸钡密度是普通石头的两倍如果你根据弹道学的理论去计算大卫投出的那个石头的制动能力基本上相当于一把口径为0.45的手枪这可是置人于死地的武器精确度，我们从历史记录上可以看出投石手——经验丰富的投石手可以射伤甚至射死远达200码外的人从中世纪的一些挂毯上，我们得知投石手能击中空中飞翔的鸟儿他们的精准度相当高大卫抡绳子时，离哥利亚还不到200码离得很近当他抡起绳子朝哥利亚投石时他已经打算好了就是要击中哥利亚最脆弱的部位也就是他的眉心如果回顾古代战争史你会经常发现投石手是抗击步兵的决定性因素不管是什么战争
en:Well, let&#39;s start there with the phrase&quot;All David has is this sling,&quot;because that&#39;s the first mistake that we make.In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.There&#39;s cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.There&#39;s heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,armed foot soldiers with swords and shieldsand some kind of armor.And there&#39;s artillery, and artillery are archers,but, more importantly, slingers.And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouchwith two long cords attached to it,and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like thisand they let one of the cords go,and the effect is to send the projectile forwardtowards its target.That&#39;s what David has, and it&#39;s important to understandthat that sling is not a slingshot.It&#39;s not this, right? It&#39;s not a child&#39;s toy.It&#39;s in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.When David rolls it around like this,he&#39;s turning the sling around probablyat six or seven revolutions per second,and that means that when the rock is released,it&#39;s going forward really fast,probably 35 meters per second.That&#39;s substantially faster than a baseballthrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elahwere not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.If you do the calculations on the ballistics,on the stopping power of the rock fired from David&#39;s sling,it&#39;s roughly equal to the stopping powerof a [.45 caliber] handgun.This is an incredibly devastating weapon.Accuracy, we know from historical recordsthat slingers — experienced slingers could hitand maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.From medieval tapestries, we know that slingerswere capable of hitting birds in flight.They were incredibly accurate.When David lines up — and he&#39;s not 200 yards away from Goliath,he&#39;s quite close to Goliath —when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,he has every intention and every expectationof being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spotbetween his eyes.If you go back over the history of ancient warfare,you will find time and time againthat slingers were the decisive factor against infantryin one kind of battle or another.

zh-cn:那哥利亚属于什么类别呢？他是重步兵他向以色列士兵挑战时预想的对手是另一名重步兵当他说，“过来吧，我要把你的肉献给天上的鸟儿和地里的野兽，”他的关键词是“过来吧”快过来，我们单挑面对面，就像这样索尔也是同样的想法大卫说，“让我去会会哥利亚，”索尔试图给他穿上铠甲因为索尔想，“噢，你说你要去‘会会’他就是指‘面对面地徒手决战’步兵间的决斗。”
en:So what&#39;s Goliath? He&#39;s heavy infantry,and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duelis that he&#39;s going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.When he says, &quot;Come to me that I mightfeed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,&quot;the key phrase is &quot;Come to me.&quot;Come up to me because we&#39;re going to fight,hand to hand, like this.Saul has the same expectation.David says, &quot;I want to fight Goliath,&quot;and Saul tries to give him his armor,because Saul is thinking, &quot;Oh, when you say &#39;fight Goliath,&#39;you mean &#39;fight him in hand-to-hand combat,&#39;infantry on infantry.&quot;
时间： 9:51
zh-cn:但大卫当然不是这样想的他肯定不会用这样的战术，为什么要这样呢他是个牧童，他一直以来都是用投石绳保护自己的羊群，驱赶狮子和狼群这也是他的优势所在所以他是一个，经验丰富的牧羊人能使用致命的武器击败笨拙的巨人哪怕巨人穿上百斤重甲手持重型武器而这些重装备却只在近距搏斗中有优势哥利亚基本就是坐以待毙，他没有机会出手那么为什么我们总是不看好大卫总是认为他不可能胜利呢？
en:But David has absolutely no expectation.He&#39;s not going to fight him that way. Why would he?He&#39;s a shepherd. He&#39;s spent his entire careerusing a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.That&#39;s where his strength lies.So here he is, this shepherd, experiencedin the use of a devastating weapon,up against this lumbering giantweighed down by a hundred pounds of armorand these incredibly heavy weaponsthat are useful only in short-range combat.Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn&#39;t have a chance.So why do we keep calling David an underdog,and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?
时间：10:34
zh-cn:另外还有一点很重要我们不仅误解了大卫和他选择的武器同时我们也高估了哥利亚哥利亚其实没那么可怕在圣经中有不少的暗示很多东西回想起来都模棱两可而且和他强大的战士的形象并不相符首先，圣经说哥利亚是被一个侍从带到山谷底下的这有点奇怪，对吧？他可是强壮的战士向以色列人单挑的战士为什么要由可能还是个小男孩的侍从带到战场上呢？第二，圣经故事里强调哥利亚行动缓慢用这来描述当时无人不晓的战士不是很奇怪吗而最奇怪的是哥利亚花了很长时间才发现大卫大卫下山并没有准备徒手搏斗书中没有记载说他“我就准备这样和你打”他甚至连剑都没带哥利亚为什么对此毫无反应呢？他好像没有意识到发生了什么还有他对大卫奇怪的嘲讽：“我是条狗吗？你拿这些打狗棒来干啥啊？”这些？大卫只带了一根而已
en:There&#39;s a second piece of this that&#39;s important.It&#39;s not just that we misunderstand Davidand his choice of weaponry.It&#39;s also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.Goliath is not what he seems to be.There&#39;s all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,things that are in retrospect quite puzzlingand don&#39;t square with his image as this mighty warrior.So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliathis led onto the valley floor by an attendant.Now that is weird, right?Here is this mighty warriorchallenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.Why is he being led by the handby some young boy, presumably,to the point of combat?Secondly, the Bible story makes special noteof how slowly Goliath moves,another odd thing to say when you&#39;re describingthe mightiest warrior known to man at that point.And then there&#39;s this whole weird thingabout how long it takes Goliath to reactto the sight of David.So David&#39;s coming down the mountain,and he&#39;s clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.There is nothing about him that says,&quot;I am about to fight you like this.&quot;He&#39;s not even carrying a sword.Why does Goliath not react to that?It&#39;s as if he&#39;s oblivious to what&#39;s going on that day.And then there&#39;s that strange comment he makes to David:&quot;Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?&quot;Sticks? David only has one stick.
时间：12:14
zh-cn:多年来，医学界一直对此颇有猜测是不是哥利亚本身就有问题他们试图去解释这些明显的反常现象人们写了不少文章第一篇发表在1960年的印第安纳医学杂志上开始了一系列的推测首先，它解释了哥利亚的身高在当时，哥利亚比他的同龄人高出一个肩膀通常来说，如果有人超出正常范围如此之多人们就会对其作出解释巨人症最常见的症状叫做肢端肥大症肢端肥大症是由位于脑下垂体的良性肿瘤过多分泌人类生长激素而导致的纵观历史，许多著名的巨人都患有肢端肥大症世界上有史以来最高的是一个叫Robert Wadlow的人他在24岁离世时仍然在长个子当时身高是2米72他患有肢端肥大症你们还记得摔跤手巨人安德烈吗？很有名。他也患有肢端肥大症甚至有人猜测亚伯拉罕·林肯也有肢端肥大症只要有谁特别高我们首先都会想到这种解释肢端肥大症还有其特有的副作用主要和视力有关脑下垂体肿瘤生长到一定程度时常会压迫到大脑里的视觉神经导致肢端肥大症患者要么复视，要么近视
en:Well, it turns out that there&#39;s been a great dealof speculation within the medical community over the yearsabout whether there is somethingfundamentally wrong with Goliath,an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.There have been many articles written.The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,and it started a chain of speculationthat starts with an explanation for Goliath&#39;s height.So Goliath is head and shoulders aboveall of his peers in that era,and usually when someone is that far out of the norm,there&#39;s an explanation for it.So the most common form of giantismis a condition called acromegaly,and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumoron your pituitary glandthat causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.And throughout history, many of the most famous giantshave all had acromegaly.So the tallest person of all timewas a guy named Robert Wadlowwho was still growing when he died at the age of 24and he was 8 foot 11.He had acromegaly.Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant?Famous. He had acromegaly.There&#39;s even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.Anyone who&#39;s unusually tall,that&#39;s the first explanation we come up with.And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effectsassociated with it,principally having to do with vision.The pituitary tumor, as it grows,often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,with the result that people with acromegalyhave either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.

zh-cn:所以当人们猜测哥利亚哪里出了毛病的时候他们都会说，“等一下，他看起来很像是患上了肢端肥大症。”这就解释了那天哥利亚很多奇怪的举动为什么他行动迟缓而且必须要由人带着他到山谷下呢？因为他没法自己走下去为什么他如此无视大卫不明白大卫不到最后一刻是不会与他交手的呢？因为他看不见大卫当他说，“过来吧，我要把你的肉献给天上的鸟儿和地里的野兽，”时这句“过来吧”也暴露了他的弱点过来吧，因为我看不见你另外，“我是条狗吗？你拿这些打狗棒来干啥啊？”大卫只拿了一根棒，而他看见的是两根
en:So when people have started to speculateabout what might have been wrong with Goliath,they&#39;ve said, &quot;Wait a minute,he looks and sounds an awful lot like someonewho has acromegaly.&quot;And that would also explain so much of what was strangeabout his behavior that day.Why does he move so slowlyand have to be escorted down into the valley floorby an attendant?Because he can&#39;t make his way on his own.Why is he so strangely oblivious to Davidthat he doesn&#39;t understand that David&#39;s not going to fight himuntil the very last moment?Because he can&#39;t see him.When he says, &quot;Come to me that I might feed your fleshto the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,&quot;the phrase &quot;come to me&quot; is a hint also of his vulnerability.Come to me because I can&#39;t see you.And then there&#39;s, &quot;Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?&quot;He sees two sticks when David has only one.
时间：14:58
zh-cn:所以以色列人在山脊上往下看时，以为他是无比强大的敌人他们不知道的是巨人外表强大的根源也是他弱点的根源
en:So the Israelites up on the mountain ridgelooking down on him thought he wasthis extraordinarily powerful foe.What they didn&#39;t understand was thatthe very thing that was the source of his apparent strengthwas also the source of his greatest weakness.
时间：15:15
zh-cn:我认为这个故事给我们所有人都上了一课巨人并不像看起来那么强大有时牧童的口袋里，还有一根投石绳
en:And there is, I think, in that,a very important lesson for all of us.Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.
