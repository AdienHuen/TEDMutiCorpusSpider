zh-cn:许多公司正在丧失控制权发生在华尔街的事已从华尔街日报上消失发生在拉斯维加斯的事却荣登YouTube（笑声）名声和忠诚变得反覆无常管理层似乎与他们的员工背道而驰。（笑声）（图中文字：“高盛将有良知的员工关在单独的格子间里办公”洋葱网）最近一项调查显示，27%的老板觉得其员工受到了公司的激励结果呢，同样还是这个调查称只有4%的员工这么想许多公司正在失去对顾客和员工的控制不过他们真的失去了么？
en:Companies are losing control.What happens on Wall Streetno longer stays on Wall Street.What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube. (Laughter)Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle.Management teams seem increasinglydisconnected from their staff. (Laughter)A recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believetheir employees are inspired by their firm.However, in the same survey, only four percentof employees agreed.Companies are losing controlof their customers and their employees.But are they really?

zh-cn:我是个营销人员，作为一个营销人员，我知道自己从来没有真正地控制过什么谚语说：你的品牌是你不房间里的时候别人对你的评价网络的超连通性和高透明度让公司全天24小时都在那个房间里他们可以聆听并参与谈话实际上，公司通过&quot;失控&quot;，反而拥有了前所未有的掌控力他们可以自己来设计。但是怎么做呢？
en:I&#39;m a marketer, and as a marketer, I knowthat I&#39;ve never really been in control.Your brand is what other people say about youwhen you&#39;re not in the room, the saying goes.Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companiesto be in that room now, 24/7.They can listen and join the conversation.In fact, they have more control over the loss of controlthan ever before.They can design for it. But how?

zh-cn:首先，他们能给予顾客和员工更多的控制权公司可以在理念、知识、内容、设计以及产品的创造上跟他们合作公司还可以给顾客更多定价权就像电台司令乐队使用“买者定价”的方式在网上发布新专辑“在彩虹中”时一样，顾客可以自行决定价格不过商品的数量和销售时间则是有限的而这张唱片比之前的几张卖的都要好丹麦巧克力公司Anthon Berg在哥本哈根开了一家“慷慨商店”它要求顾客对所爱的人做出“善行承诺”然后用这个承诺作为货币来“购买”巧克力这使得交易变成了互动慷慨变成了货币公司甚至还可以给黑客一些权利当微软发布Kinect时这种用动作操控Xbox的设备很快吸引了大量黑客的目光微软起初极力遏制黑客，后来却反其道而行之因为它意识到主动支持这些家伙利大于弊共同拥有的感觉、免费的宣传附加的价值，都帮助Kinect提升了销量
en:First of all, they can give employees and customers more control.They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas,knowledge, content, designs and product.They can give them more control over pricing,which is what the band Radiohead didwith its pay-as-you-like online release of its album&quot;In Rainbows.&quot; Buyers could determine the price,but the offer was exclusive, and only stood for a limited period of time.The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band.The Danish chocolate company Anthon Bergopened a so-called &quot;generous store&quot; in Copenhagen.It asked customers to purchase chocolatewith the promise of good deeds towards loved ones.It turned transactions into interactions,and generosity into a currency.Companies can even give control to hackers.When Microsoft Kinect came out,the motion-controlled add-on to its Xbox gaming console,it immediately drew the attention of hackers.Microsoft first fought off the hacks, but then shifted coursewhen it realized that actively supporting the communitycame with benefits.The sense of co-ownership, the free publicity,the added value, all helped drive sales.

zh-cn:给消费者的终极权利是叫他们不要买户外服装品牌Patagonia鼓励潜在顾客在买新货之前先上eBay找找他们的二手货或者给旧鞋换个鞋底就行了为抵制消费主义，该公司还发起更激进的活动大打&quot;别买这件外套&quot;的广告而且还是在购物季正如火如荼的时候这种手法也许有损短期销量但能在共同的价值观基础上建立长久的品牌忠诚度
en:The ultimate empowerment of customersis to ask them not to buy.Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyersto check out eBay for its used productsand to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones.In an even more radical stance against consumerism,the company placed a &quot;Don&#39;t Buy This Jacket&quot;advertisement during the peak of shopping season.It may have jeopardized short-term sales,but it builds lasting, long-term loyaltybased on shared values.

zh-cn:公司可以释放权力也可以收回权力传统的商业智慧认为信任的基础是可预测的行为但是当一切都一致化、标准化时要如何创造有意义的经历？减少人们的控制权也许是个抵消过量选择的好方法也可以让人们更开心例如Nextpedition这家旅行社就把旅行变成游戏一路上都有意想不到的惊奇旅行社会一直卖关子，旅客要到最后才知道自己要去哪，并得到相关信息同样，丹麦航空公司KLM也用类似的手法推出惊喜之旅随机送出小礼物给旅客到达目的地之前都惊喜不断总部位于英国的Interflora花店利用Twitter锁定走了一天霉运的用户免费送他们一束鲜花
en:Companies can give people more control,but they can also give them less control.Traditional business wisdom holds that trustis earned by predictable behavior,but when everything is consistent and standardized,how do you create meaningful experiences?Giving people less control might be a wonderful wayto counter the abundance of choiceand make them happier.Take the travel service Nextpedition.Nextpedition turns the trip into a game,with surprising twists and turns along the way.It does not tell the traveler where she&#39;s goinguntil the very last minute, and information is providedjust in time. Similarly, Dutch airline KLMlaunched a surprise campaign, seemingly randomlyhanding out small gifts to travelersen route to their destination.U.K.-based Interflora monitored Twitterfor users who were having a bad day,and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers.

zh-cn:公司有没有什么办法减少员工的时间压力？有就是强迫他们帮助别人最近一项研究显示，如果员工在一天内能抽点时间进行些有利他人的活动他们对整体生产率的感知就会得到提升我工作的公司Frog会举行快速见面会，在新老员工之间搭起一座桥梁帮助他们迅速了解彼此通过建立一套严密的体系，员工的控制权减少了选择虽然少了，但社交互动更丰富了

zh-cn:公司是自身财富的创造者和我们所有人一样，他们随时会遇到突发状况这使他们更卑微、更脆弱也更具人性说到底，网络的超连通性和透明度让公司的行为暴露在光天化日之下，而忠于自我是创造持久价值的唯一方法正如芭蕾演员阿隆索‧金恩所说&quot;你的有趣之处就是你自己&quot;要让公司的本色外显于世开诚布公是不二法门但是彻底公开不能解决问题因为公开一切等于什么都没公开&quot;微笑是一扇半开半关的门&quot;这是作家珍妮佛‧伊根写的公司可以让员工和客户有更多或更少的控制权可以评估公开多少对自己有利以及什么不能公开或者他们也可以微微一笑， 以开放的姿态接受各种可能谢谢各位(掌声)(掌声)
en:Companies are the makers of their fortunes,and like all of us, they are utterly exposed to serendipity.That should make them more humble, more vulnerableand more human.At the end of the day, as hyperconnectivityand transparency expose companies&#39; behaviorin broad daylight, staying true to their true selvesis the only sustainable value proposition.Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said,&quot;What&#39;s interesting about you is you.&quot;For the true selves of companies to come through,openness is paramount,but radical openness is not a solution,because when everything is open, nothing is open.&quot;A smile is a door that is half open and half closed,&quot;the author Jennifer Egan wrote.Companies can give their employees and customersmore control or less. They can worry about how muchopenness is good for them, and what needs to stay closed.Or they can simply smile, and remain opento all possibilities.Thank you. (Applause)(Applause)
