zh-cn:史努比是我最喜爱的卡通人物之一我喜欢看它坐在或躺在窝里，思考人生。所以当我想到同情这个词我的脑海中立马就浮现出一幅漫画史努比躺在那，自言自语“我十分了解并且十分欣赏一个人应该爱他的邻居就像爱他自己一样但问题是，我不能忍受我的隔壁邻居。”这个,从某种程度上来说，就是一个挑战是如何诠释一个相当妙的想法的挑战
en:One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.So when I thought about compassion,my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,where he&#39;s lying there and he says,&quot;I really understand, and I really appreciatehow one should love one&#39;s neighbor as one love&#39;s oneself.The only trouble is the people next door; I can&#39;t stand them.&quot;This, in a way, is one of the challengesof how to interpret a really good idea.

zh-cn:我想大家都认可同情之心。如果你试着了解世界上所有的主流宗教信仰你会发现其中一部分宗教有关于同情心的教义例如，犹太教的托拉（犹太教圣经）要求我们要爱我们的邻居如同爱我们自己一样。根据犹太教教义，犹太教教士希利教导我们己所不欲勿施于人基本上所有的主流宗教都有类似的教义另外，犹太教还有一条教义是关于上帝的教义称上帝具有同情之心，被称作ha-rachaman毕竟，如果连上帝都没有同情心，这个世界如何存在？托拉中提到，我们都是以上帝为样本创造的因此，我们也必须具有同情之心但这又意味着什么，又是如何影响我们的日常生活呢？有时候，富于同情之心肯定会衍生出一些我们自身都难以控制的情绪。
en:We all, I think, believe in compassion.If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,you&#39;ll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,who taught that you shouldn&#39;t do to others what you don&#39;t like being done to yourself.And all the main religions have similar teachings.And again, within Judaism,we have a teaching about God,who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God,so we too have to be compassionate.But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?Sometimes, of course, being compassionatecan produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.

zh-cn:有很多次当我参加或主持葬礼或者待在死者或是即将逝世的人们身旁悲痛就会将我团团包围，让我不知所措更别说死者家属亲人有多么难过我的心受到触动，眼泪忍不住涌出但如果我不控制自己的情绪，放任悲痛继续我就没法正常工作了因为我的工作就是帮助死者超度给他们主持仪式，并确保仪式的正常进行而如果，相反我没有同情之心那么我就不配穿上这身礼袍不配做一个拉比
en:I know there are many times when I&#39;ve gone and conducted a funeral,or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying,and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty,the challenge that is there for the family, for the person.And I&#39;m touched, so that tears come to my eyes.And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,I wouldn&#39;t be doing my job —because I have to actually be there for themand make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.And yet, on the other hand, if I didn&#39;t feel this compassion,then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robeand give up being a rabbi.

zh-cn:当面对这个大千世界的种种，我们每一个人都会有这样的感受有谁可能不被同情之心触动，在目睹了战争饥荒、地震、海啸肆虐后的景象？我知道有些人会说“这样的悲剧日日上演，我对此无能为力，我也不会试着去帮助。”慈善工作者称这种看法为同情疲软还有一些人则感觉他们再也无法面对同情心带给他们的困境，所以他们选择关掉电视机，不看任何节目但犹太教一直倡导应该在这二者中取得平衡
en:And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.Who cannot be touched by compassionwhen we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?I know some people who say&quot;Well, you know there&#39;s just so much out there — I can&#39;t do anything,I&#39;m not going to even begin to try.&quot;And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.There are others who feel they can&#39;t confront compassion anymore,and so they turn off the television and don&#39;t watch.In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.

zh-cn:当然，你必须要清楚他人的需要但这种清楚是要建立在你的生活能够正常进行的基础上然后给予他人帮助因此，同情的部分意义在于了解人们为什么做一件事的原因而且，显而易见，你不可能做到了解他人除非你稍微多了解一下你自己。
en:You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others,but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your lifeand be of help to people.So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.And, of course, you can&#39;t do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.

zh-cn:犹太教教义巧妙地解释了创世纪的由来在上帝创造这个世界的时候他认为最佳做法就是仅赋予这个世界正义这个神圣的属性因为上帝是正义的。理所当然整个世界都应该是正义的但上帝看了看未来发现如果世界只有正义，那么世界就不会存在
en:And there&#39;s a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation,which says that when God created the world,God thought that it would be best to create the worldonly with the divine attribute of justice.Because, after all, God is just.Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world.And then God looked to the future and realized,if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn&#39;t exist.

zh-cn:于是他想了想：“算了，我还是只赋予世界同情之心吧。”然后上帝又看了看未来结果发现如果世界只有同情那将是一片混乱任何事物都必须有限度拉比认为这就像做一个一国之王他拥有一个精美易碎的玻璃碗如果加入过多冷水，碗就会碎如果加入沸水，碗也会碎那要怎么办？加入两者混合后的温水。因此，上帝同时赋予了世界正义和同情。
en:So, God thought, &quot;Nope, I&#39;m going to create the world just with compassion.&quot;And then God looked to the future and realized that,in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,there would be anarchy and chaos.There had to be limits to all things.The rabbis describe this as being like a kingwho has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.

zh-cn:除此之外，我们还要考虑更多关于一些情绪的表达当我们有同情心时所产生的情绪将这些情绪投入到更广阔的世界里，化为行动我们不能像史努比那样光躺在那幻想着如何友好对待我们的邻居而应该付诸行动犹太教也倡导爱与宽容这两点非常重要，还有慈悲为怀
en:There is something more though that has to be there.And that is the translation of the feelingsthat we may have about compassioninto the wider world, into action.So, like Snoopy, we can&#39;t just lie thereand think great thoughts about our neighbors.We actually have to do something about it.And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindnessthat becomes very important: &quot;chesed.&quot;

zh-cn:爱、宽容以及慈悲应该相互融合正义界定了我们的生活让我们明辨是非让我们明白应该做什么，这就是社会的正义我们要乐于行善但同时应保持我们的理智你不可能为任何人做任何事而没有任何限制，不计代价保持平衡使之适中，就是这里同情心的概念。我们的本质就该如此
en:All these three things, then, have to be melded together.The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our livesand gives us a feeling of what&#39;s right about life, what&#39;s right about living,what should we be doing, social justice.There has to be a willingness to do good deeds,but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.You know, there&#39;s no way that you can do anything for anyoneif you overdo things.And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion,which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.

zh-cn:我们有同情之心因为我们是以上帝为样本创造的而上帝正是最具同情心的同情意味着什么意味着了解他人的痛苦但还不止这点还意味着了解个人同世界万物的联系了解个人是世界万物的一部分我们所看到听到以及感觉到的一切事物是一个统一的整体我称之为统一的神这种统一性联结了世界万物
en:This idea of compassion comes to usbecause we&#39;re made in the image of God,who is ultimately the compassionate one.What does this compassion entail?It entails understanding the pain of the other.But even more than that,it means understanding one&#39;s connection to the whole of creation:understanding that one is part of that creation,that there is a unity that underlies all that we see,all that we hear, all that we feel.I call that unity God.And that unity is something that connects all of creation.

zh-cn:在现代社会中，伴随着环保运动我们更加意识到事物之间的联系我在这做的事真的会对非洲产生影响如果我过多使用我的碳排放额度，那么可能会造成非洲中部和东部极度缺乏雨水这就是所谓的联系我意识到作为世界万物的一小个组成部分作为以上帝为样本创造的我我必须了解我个人的需求有时候要升华成其他更重要的需求
en:And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement,we&#39;re becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things,that something I do here actually does matter in Africa,that if I use too much of my carbon allowance,it seems to be that we are causinga great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.So there is a connectivity,and I have to understand that — as part of the creation,as part of me being made in the image of God.And I have to understand that my needssometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.

zh-cn:这个18分钟的演讲，我觉得十分具有吸引力因为在犹太教里，希伯来数字18代表生命，生命这个词。因此，从某种意义上来说，这18分钟对我是个挑战，让我说在生活中，这就是为什么具有同情心很重要但还有一些其他的东西也很重要实际上，18分钟是很关键的因为在逾越节（犹太人的宗教节日），我们必须吃无酵面包拉比会告诉我们用于制作普通面包的生面团和制作无酵面包，也就是酵饼的生面团的区别他们说就是18分钟。即生面团发酵所需的时间这又意味着什么呢，面团发酵？它意味着面团内里被热空气填满什么是酵饼？ 什么是无酵面包？ 你不知道。
en:This &quot;18 minutes&quot; business, I find quite fascinating.Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters,stands for life — the word &quot;life.&quot;So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,&quot;In life, this is what&#39;s important in terms of compassion.&quot;But, something else as well:actually, 18 minutes is important.Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or &quot;matzah&quot;?And they say &quot;It&#39;s 18 minutes.&quot;Because that&#39;s how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.What does it mean, &quot;dough becomes leaven&quot;?It means it gets filled with hot air.What&#39;s matzah? What&#39;s unleavened bread? You don&#39;t get it.

zh-cn:从象征意义上来说，就是在逾越节上我们必须试着摆脱我们的热气，骄傲，以及我们的良好自我感觉，就是我们是整个世界上最重要的人地球就围着我们转动这些就是我们要试着摆脱的付诸行动，试着摆脱这些习惯、情绪、想法这些东西控制了我们，蒙蔽了我们的双眼，让我们变成井底之蛙以致我们无法看到他人的需求我们必须摆脱这些，让自己解脱这也是具有同情心的基础让我们看清自己在世界的定位
en:Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover,what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air — our pride,our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world,and that everything should revolve round us.So we try and get rid of those,and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideasthat enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel visionso we don&#39;t see the needs of others —and free ourselves and free ourselves from that.And that too is a basis for having compassion,for understanding our place in the world.

zh-cn:犹太教里有一个美丽的故事有一天，一个富人坐在犹太教堂中像很多人一样，他也在布道的过程中打瞌睡他打瞌睡的时候，正念到托拉中的利未记“在古代，耶路撒冷的寺庙中祭司一度是有面包的他们把面包放在耶路撒冷的寺庙中一个专用的桌子上”那个富人正睡着，但他听到了其中的几个词，面包，寺庙，上帝，就醒了他自言自语：“上帝需要面包，对，就是这样。我知道上帝要什么了。”
en:Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous storyof a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem,the priests used to have bread,which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.He said, &quot;God wants bread. That&#39;s it. God wants bread. I know what God wants.&quot;
时间：11:38
zh-cn:于是他飞奔回家。安息日过后，他做了12条面包并把面包带到教堂里他打开约柜(藏于古犹太圣殿至圣所内、刻有十诫的两块石板)，说：“上帝，我不知道你为什么要这些面包，但还是给你带来了。”说完，他将面包和成卷的托拉放入约柜中£然后就回家了
en:And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread,took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue,opened the ark and said, &quot;God, I don&#39;t know why you want this bread, but here you are.&quot;And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.Then he went home.

zh-cn:清洁工来到教堂里“上帝啊，我的生活不好过，我有孩子需要养我的妻子病了，我没有钱，该怎么办？”他走进教堂，“上帝，你能帮帮我吗？呀，什么味道好香啊。”他走到约柜前，打开约柜“竟然有面包！上帝，你回应了我的请求，你回答了我的问题。”他带上面包回家了
en:The cleaner came into the synagogue.&quot;Oh God, I&#39;m in such trouble. I&#39;ve got children to feed.My wife&#39;s ill. I&#39;ve got no money. What can I do?&quot;He goes into the synagogue. &quot;God, will you please help me?Ah, what a wonderful smell.&quot;He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.&quot;There&#39;s bread! God, you&#39;ve answered my plea. You&#39;ve answered my question.&quot;Takes the bread and goes home.
时间：12:27
zh-cn:与此同时，富人在心里想，“我真傻，上帝怎么会要面包？上帝是整个世界的主宰者，怎么会要我的面包？“他冲到教堂，“我要在别人发现之前把面包从约柜中拿出来。”他打开约柜，但是面包不见了于是他说:“上帝，你真的要我的面包下周我会加上葡萄干给你。”
en:Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself,&quot;I&#39;m an idiot. God wants bread?God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?&quot;He rushes to the synagogue. &quot;I&#39;ll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it.&quot;He goes in there, and it&#39;s not there.And he says, &quot;God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.Next week, with raisins.&quot;
时间：12:52
zh-cn:就这样，过了许多年每周，富人都会带来葡萄干面包还有其他好东西，一并放入约柜中每周，清洁工都会来：“上帝，你再次回应了我的请求。”然后将面包带回家
en:This went on for years.Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins,with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.Every week, the cleaner would come. &quot;God you&#39;ve answered my plea again.&quot;Take the bread. Take it home.

en:And the rabbi said, &quot;You&#39;ve misunderstood me.You&#39;ve misunderstood totally,&quot; he said.&quot;Of course, what you are doing,&quot; he said to the rich man,&quot;is answering God&#39;s plea that we should be compassionate.And God,&quot; he said to the poor man, &quot;is answering your pleathat people should be compassionate and give.&quot;He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man&#39;s hands and said,&quot;Don&#39;t you understand?&quot; He said, &quot;These are the hands of God.&quot;
时间：14:18
zh-cn:这就是我的感受我只能试着去接近具有同情之心这样一种信念，通过弄清这个世界存在联系，它是一个统一的整体而我想要试着为这种统一服务这样我就能付诸行动，通过了解，我希望，通过试着了解他人的痛苦♫但也要明白这是有限度的，人们必须承担责任承担有些发生在他们身上的事情的责任同时我也必须明白我的力量是有限的我能提供的帮助是有限的我需要重新评估他们试着找出物质方面的东西以及可能控制我的各种情绪只有这样，我才能看清这个世界
en:So that is the way I feel:that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate,of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world;that I want to try and serve that unity,and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope,trying to understand something of the pain of others;but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibilityfor some of the problems that come upon them;and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy,to the giving I can give.I have to reevaluate them,try and separate out the material thingsand my emotions that may be enslaving me,so that I can see the world clearly.
时间：15:21
zh-cn:然后我必须试着弄清通过什么方式才能将自己的双手变成上帝的双手从而在这个世界上唤醒真正意义上的同情之心。
en:And then I have to try to see in what waysI can make these the hands of God.And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.
