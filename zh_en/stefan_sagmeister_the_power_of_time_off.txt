zh-cn:我在纽约开一家设计工作室每七年我都关闭 一年让我进行一些 （萤幕：七年之痒）小实验，一些通常不容易在正常的工作年度里达成的事关闭的一年， 我们不接受任何顾客完全关门可想而知那是一段美好又充满能量的时光
en:I run a design studio in New York.Every seven years, I close it for one yearto pursuesome little experiments, things thatare always difficult to accomplishduring the regular working year.In that year, we are not availablefor any of our clients.We are totally closed.And as you can imagine,it is a lovely and very energetic time.

zh-cn:我起先在纽约开了这家工作室为的是结合我的两项酷爱： 音乐和设计我们制作录像和设计装璜其中有很多是你们熟悉的音乐家更多是你们没有听闻过的音乐家我发觉就像生活中很多我喜爱的事物一旦习以为常便渐渐变得沉闷我的工作室也不例外我们的作品开始变得类同看到了吧，书中藏着一颗玻璃眼睛同样的设计，用于香水包装书中藏着一瓶香水因此我们决定关门一年
en:I originally had opened the studio in New Yorkto combine my two loves, music and design.And we created videos and packagingfor many musicians that you know,and for even more that you&#39;ve never heard of.As I realized, just like with many many things in my lifethat I actually love,I adapt to it.And I get, over time, bored by them.And for sure, in our case,our work started to look the same.You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book.Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packagedin a book, in a die cut.So I decided to close it down for one year.

zh-cn:我还有另一个原因目前我们大概用生命的前二十五年学习之后的四十年用于工作放到最后的是约十五年的退休生活我觉得更合理的，可能是拿走五年的退休时间把它们穿插在工作的年头里（鼓掌）我自己显然因此很开心但更重要的是是来自休假那几年的成果可以回馈公司回馈社会而不仅是贡献给一两个孙子孙女
en:Also is the knowledge thatright now we spend aboutin the first 25 years of our lives learning,then there is another 40 yearsthat&#39;s really reserved for working.And then tacked on at the end of itare about 15 years for retirement.And I thought it might be helpfulto basically cut off five of those retirement yearsand intersperse them in between those working years.(Applause)That&#39;s clearly enjoyable for myself.But probably even more important isthat the work that comes out of these yearsflows back into the companyand into society at large,rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.

zh-cn:两年前有一位TED的讲者名叫乔纳森 海德特（Jonathan Haidt)他把工作定义为三个不同的层次教我深深认同我可以把工作视为一份工，为的是钱星期四就开始盼周末我可能会需要一种业余爱好，平衡生活或者，我可以把工作看成我的事业，这样我会做得更加用心但有时我又会想花这多精力值得吗？第三个层次，是把工作视为一种呼召如果工作是一种呼召，很可能我无论如何也会做，即使没有金钱回报也没关系
en:There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago,Jonathan Haidt,who defined his work into three different levels.And they rang very true for me.I can see my work as a job. I do it for money.I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.In a career I&#39;m definitely more engaged.But at the same time, there will be periods when I thinkis all that really hard work really worth my while?While in the third one, in the calling,very much likely I would do it alsoif I wouldn&#39;t be financially compensated for it.

zh-cn:我不信教但我尊重自然我的第一个长修假是在纽约市度过的我希望第二次会有所不同欧洲和美国对我吸引力不大我太熟悉它们了，所以我选了亚洲我见到的亚洲最美丽的风景是在斯里兰卡和巴厘岛斯里兰卡仍有内战进行，因此我选择了巴厘岛。那是一个美妙，十分重视手工艺的社会
en:I am not a religious person myself,but I did look for nature.I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.Looked for something different for the second one.Europe and the U.S. didn&#39;t really feel enticingbecause I knew them too well. So Asia it was.The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asiawere Sri Lanka and Bali.Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.It&#39;s a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.

zh-cn:我2008年9月到达那里立即投入工作那地方本身就充满灵气然而，我首先需要的是驱蚊剂因为蚊子太多了其次我需要某种方法赶走那些野狗他们绕着我的房子当我早上散步时来袭击我我们就此做了99狗像系列的T恤衫一只狗一个T恤衫作为一个小报复我加了一条小小的、略带威胁的信息（笑声）在T恤衫的背后（笑声）
en:I arrived there in September 2008,and pretty much started to work right away.There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.However the first thing that I needed wasmosquito repellent typographybecause they were definitely around heavily.And then I needed some sort of wayto be able to get back to all the wild dogsthat surround my house,and attacked me during my morning walks.So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.Every single dog on one tee shirt.As a little retaliationwith a just ever so slightly menacing message(Laughter)on the back of the shirt.(Laughter)

zh-cn:在我离开纽约前我觉得可以装修一下我的工作室我把工作全交给别人自己不再操心只管卖家具结果是我喜欢的都买不起买得起的 我又都不喜欢于是我在巴厘岛要做的其中一件事情就是设计家具设计这个时 ， 当然 ， 我们仍跟野狗较量中还没全部完成我记得完成这盏灯的时候（笑声）我终于跟狗讲和了（笑声）
en:Just before I left New YorkI decided I could actually renovate my studio.And then just leave it all to them.And I don&#39;t have to do anything.So I looked for furniture.And it turned out thatall the furniture that I really liked,I couldn&#39;t afford.And all the stuff I could afford, I didn&#39;t like.So one of the things that we pursued in Baliwas pieces of furniture.This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.It&#39;s not quite finished yet.And I think by the time this lamp came about,(Laughter)I had finally made peace with those dogs.(Laughter)

zh-cn:我还设计了这张茶几起名叫“现在到此”它里面装了330个指南针我们还特制了特浓咖啡的小杯子里面藏着磁铁它使这些指南针拼命地动全朝向咖啡杯为中心之后又设计这个相当健谈， 絮絮不休的椅子在巴厘岛，我开始平生第一次打坐不过，同时我又请楚的意识到听别人讲他们的高兴事有多无聊所以我就不多说了
en:Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.It&#39;s called Be Here Now.It includes 330 compasses.And we had custom espresso cups madethat hide a magnet inside,and make those compasses go crazy,always centering on them.Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.And at the same time, I&#39;m extremely awarehow boring it is to hear about other people&#39;s happinesses.So I will not really go too far into it.

en:Many of you will know this TEDster,Danny Gilbert, whose book, actually,I got it through the TED book club.I think it took me four yearsto finally read it, while on sabbatical.And I was pleased to seethat he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.And I&#39;ll show you a couple of peoplethat did well by pursuing sabbaticals.

zh-cn:看看我的周期，干七年，休一年是我百分之12.5的时间看看比我更成功的公司3M公司，自20世纪30年代起让所有的工程师花百分之十五工作时间做他们自己想做的事有些很成功的例子思高牌胶带就是这个公司政策下的产物还有Art Fry 研制的不干胶贴纸，也是他利用私人时间为3M发明的谷歌， 众人皆知给他们的软件工程师百分之二十的时间去做他们自己想做的项目
en:If I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,it&#39;s 12.5 percent of my time.And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,3M since the 1930sis giving all their engineers15 percent to pursue whatever they want.There is some good successes.Scotch tape came out of this program,as well as Art Fry developedsticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.Google, of course, very famouslygives 20 percent for their software engineersto pursue their own personal projects.

zh-cn:听众里有没有人尝试过修长假呢？大概百分之五吧坐你身边的人举手了吗请和他们聊聊， 看他们的休假是否成功我发现探讨我未来想做的事最佳的办法是与做过的人谈谈那比自己空想要更有效
en:Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?That&#39;s about five percent of everybody.So I&#39;m not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.Talk to them about if it was successful or not.I&#39;ve found thatfinding out about what I&#39;m going to like in the future,my very best way is to talk to peoplewho have actually done itmuch better than myself envisioning it.

en:When I had the idea of doing one,the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about itso that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.(Laughter)

zh-cn:我的第一个休假初期事情进展一点也不顺利我以为不用计划空闲本身就很好使人创新。但我错了没有计划，我会被动的去应付琐碎小事，我不是指工作上的事情那些我全拒绝了，我是指的其他琐事比如说给日本设计杂志写信就是说，我成了给自己打下手的学徒工（笑声）
en:In the beginning, on the first sabbatical,it was rather disastrous.I had thought that I should do this without any plan,that this vacuum of time somehow wouldbe wonderful and enticingfor idea generation. It was not.I just, without a plan, I just reactedto little requests, not work requests,those I all said no to, but other little requests.Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.So I became my own intern.(Laughter)

zh-cn:很快我把自己感兴趣的事情列了个清单把它们分门别类，分给大块的时间然后作个计划，就像在小学校做的一样计划有什么呢？ 星期一8至9点：写小说9至10点，预想未来那不是很成功。等等，等等。而实际上，作为第一次休假的开始这些安排很适合我结果呢我又重新爱上设计了我自得其乐从长远经济角度看，我的第一个长假是成功的由于质量提高，我们可以设更高的价格
en:And I very quicklymade a list of the things I was interested in,put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of timeand then made a plan, very much like in grade school.What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;9 to 10: future thinking.Was not very successful. And so on and so forth.And that actually, specifically as a starting pointof the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.What came out of it?I really got close to design again.I had fun.Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.

zh-cn:或许最重要的是基本上在下七年我们的设计意念俱源自我们休假的那一年请你看看以下几项作品都是那个长休假之后七年设计的第一种体会是 （在设计品牌时）我们过分强调一致性其实这种凡事必须完全相同的想法仅仅能对极少数公司行得通而并非每间公司都合适
en:And probably most importantly,basically everything we&#39;ve donein the seven years following the first sabbaticalcame out of thinking of that one single year.And I&#39;ll show you a couple of projectsthat came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.One of the strands of thinking I was involved in wasthat sameness is so incredibly overrated.This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the sameworks for a very very few strand of companies,and not for everybody else.

zh-cn:音乐之家 （Casa de Musica) 曾请我们设计标志就是那个由 Rem Koolhaas 设计建造的音乐中心在波尔图，葡萄牙尽管我想要把这个标志设计得与建筑物造型没关结果却没有成功一个主要原因是因为Rem Koolhaas给波尔图市做的一场简报他说到要把多层含意交织在一起我起先没有明白直至我把他的建筑设计语言翻成一般英语去理解基本上，建筑设计就是标志设计我才明白，那建筑本身就是一个标志
en:We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,the Rem Koolhaas-built music centerin Porto, in Portugal.And even though I desired to do an identitythat doesn&#39;t use the architecture,I failed at that.And mostly also because I realizedout of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, wherehe talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.Which I understood after Itranslated it from architecture speechin to regular English,basically as logo making.And I understood that the building itself was a logo.
时间：10:55
zh-cn:事情由此变得十分容易我们在建筑上蒙了个罩子从远远的地面查看从各个角度查看西，北，南，东从上到下用非常特殊的方式着色让我的一个朋友写了个软件叫音乐之家®标志生成器把它连接到扫描仪把任何图像放上，例如贝多芬像软件可以立即给你音乐之家贝多芬标志当你想设计一个有贝多芬像的海报那软件很有用，因为标志的视觉元素和海报是完全一样的
en:So then it became quite easy.We put a mask on it,looked at it deep down in the ground,checked it out from all sides,west, north, south, east,top and bottom.Colored them in a very particular wayby having a friend of mine write a piece of software,the Casa da Musica Logo Generator.That&#39;s connected to a scanner.You put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.And the software, in a second,will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,comes in handy, because the visual information of the logoand the actual poster is exactly the same.

zh-cn:所以在概念的层面而言，它们一定能互相配合如果演出Zappa的音乐，它会有自己独特的标志或Philip Grass，或Lou Reed，或 Chemical Brothers谁在那里表演，谁就有自己的标志这是音乐之家自己的标志在音乐之家内部也是一样，不论是音乐之家主席，或是音乐总监他们的音乐之家画像印在他们的名片上有一队完整的管弦乐队驻扎在那所建筑里他们拥有自己清晰的标志这是他们巡演用的卡车它们还有一个较小的现代乐团一个以&quot;交织 &quot;(remix) 为名的十二人乐团, 名字就交织在标志中
en:So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.If Zappa&#39;s music is performed, it gets its own logo.Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,who all performed there, get their ownCasa da Musica logo.It works the same internally with the president or the musical director,whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.There is a full-blown orchestraliving inside the building.It has a more transparent identity.The truck they go on tour with.Or there&#39;s a smaller contemporary orchestra,12 people that remixes its own title.
时间：12:23
zh-cn:十分方便的是你可以用这个标志创造广告就像这幅 Donna Toney海报或肖邦 (Chopin)，或莫扎特 (Mozart)或拉蒙杨 (La Monte Young)您可以根据它的形状设计字样你还可以把它从皮肤下长出来你可以设计一张海报，介绍一项适合一家大细， 在音乐之家外面举行的活动或在音乐之家下面举行的狂野派对或每周定期举行的活动又或是教育服务
en:And one of the handy things that came aboutwas that you could take the logo typeand create advertising out of it.Like this Donna Toney poster,or Chopin, or Mozart,or La Monte Young.You can take the shape and make typography out of it.You can grow it underneath the skin.You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,or a rave underneath the houseor a weekly program,as well as educational services.

zh-cn:第二种体会：在那次长假之前多数时候我都时用设计这种语言帮助促销那并没有什么不好一方面我不反对销售我父母都是销售员但我觉得我花了这多时间学习这种语言为什么仅用来帮助促销？应该还可以利用它做些其他事这些作品都出自这个想法有些你们可能已经见过我在以前的TED 会上曾经展示过以前的TED 会标题是“至今我所学到的”我现在就介绍两项
en:Second insight. So far, until that point I hadbeen mostly involvedor used the language of designfor promotional purposes,which was fine with me.On one hand I have nothing against selling.My parents are both salespeople.But I did feel thatI spent so much time learning this language,why do I only promote with it?There must be something else.And the whole series of work came out of it.Some of you might have seen it.I showed some of itat earlier TEDs before,under the title &quot;Things I&#39;ve Learned in My Life So Far.&quot;I&#39;ll just show two now.

zh-cn:阿姆斯特丹市给了我们一个广场，并要我们做些事情我们用石板作为网格作为我们一件小作品的背景我们从中央银行提了25万个硬币颜色有不同的深度有的崭新发亮半旧的， 和非常旧的，发黑的用了一周多的时间，得到了100多志愿者的帮忙创造了这个以花卉模样的字样文字是，“沉迷破坏生活却做就好作品”
en:And then the city of Amsterdamgave us a plaza and asked us to do something.We used the stone plates as a gridfor our little piece.We got 250,000 coins from the central bank,at different darknesses.So we got brand new ones, shiny ones,medium ones, and very old, dark ones.And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,created this fairly floral typographythat spelled, &quot;Obsessions make my life worseand my work better.&quot;
时间：14:41
zh-cn:我们的构思是把图样做得很精美要令观赏者觉得难以决定我是要把这些钱尽量拿走还是保持图像完好无缺在拚砌这个图像的过程与数百名志愿者一起的那个星期有很多居住在周围的居民都走近它看，很喜欢它当它终于完工时第一夜一个人拿了一个大塑料袋把钱币大堆大堆的装进袋子里，直到他提不动为止一位邻居报了警
en:And the idea of course was tomake the type so preciousthat as an audienceyou would be in between,&quot;Should I really take as much money as I can?Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?&quot;While we built all this upduring that week, with the 100 volunteers,a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plazagot very close to it and quite loved it.So when it was finally done,and in the first nighta guy came with big plastic bagsand scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,one of the neighbors called the police.

en:And the Amsterdam policein all their wisdom,came, saw,and they wanted to protect the artwork.And they swept it all up and put it into custodyat police headquarters.(Laughter)I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here.That&#39;s the police, getting rid of it all.So after eight hoursthat&#39;s pretty much all that was leftof the whole thing.(Laughter)

en:We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali.It&#39;s a movie about happiness.And here we asked some nearby pigsto do the titles for us.They weren&#39;t quite slick enough.So we asked the goose to do it again,and hoped she would do somehow,a more elegant or pretty job.And I think she overdid it.Just a bit too ornamental.And my studio is very close to the monkey forest.And the monkeys in that monkey forestlooked, actually, fairly happy.So we asked those guys to do it again.They did a fine job, but hada couple of readability problems.So of course whatever you don&#39;t really do yourselfdoesn&#39;t really get done properly.
