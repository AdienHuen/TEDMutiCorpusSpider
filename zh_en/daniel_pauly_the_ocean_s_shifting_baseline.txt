zh-cn:我要讲的是一个很小概念与基准线的变动有关这个概念一分钟就能讲完了所以我先讲三个故事来混时间第一个故事讲的是达尔文 我的偶像之一他曾来过这里 大家都知道 那是1935年你们可能以为他在追鸟雀其实不是他是在捕鱼他说一条鱼很”常见“这是一种石斑鱼这种鱼被大量捕捉到八十年代现在 这种鱼已经被列入国际自然保护联盟的红色名录这个故事我们已经听过很多遍了在加拉帕戈斯群岛和其他地方都听过没什么新鲜的问题在于 我们现在还会去加拉帕戈斯群岛还认为那是还是原生态旅游宣传册上还说这里未经开发这里究竟是什么情况
en:I&#39;m going to speakabout a tiny, little idea.And this is about shifting baseline.And because the idea can be explained in one minute,I will tell you three stories beforeto fill in the time.And the first storyis about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.And he was here, as you well know, in &#39;35.And you&#39;d think he was chasing finches,but he wasn&#39;t.He was actually collecting fish.And he described one of themas very &quot;common.&quot;This was the sailfin grouper.A big fishery was run on ituntil the &#39;80s.Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.Now this story,we have heard it lots of timeson Galapagos and other places,so there is nothing particular about it.But the point is, we still come to Galapagos.We still think it is pristine.The brochures still sayit is untouched.So what happens here?

zh-cn:第二个故事 讲的是另一个概念叫做变动的&quot;腰准线&quot;（众人笑）1971年的时候 我在那里考察西非的一片西湖我去那里是因为我在欧洲长大我想以后到非洲工作我以为我可以融入当地社会我还被晒伤了一大块结果我发现我的确不是非洲来的那是我第一次被晒伤
en:The second story, also to illustrate another concept,is called shifting waistline.(Laughter)Because I was there in &#39;71,studying a lagoon in West Africa.I was there because I grew up in Europeand I wanted later to work in Africa.And I thought I could blend in.And I got a big sunburn,and I was convinced that I was really not from there.This was my first sunburn.

zh-cn:这片泻湖被棕榈树环绕你们可以看到一些红树这里有罗非鱼大概20厘米长这种罗非鱼叫黑颚罗非鱼人们捕捞罗非鱼这让许多鱼存活了下来 它们活得很好渔业的收入在加纳高出平均水平二十七年之后 我回到那里这种鱼的大小缩减了一半它们成年时只有五厘米长它们的发育在遗传上被改变了那里还有鱼它们还是活得不错鱼儿们也很喜欢生活在那里似乎没什么变化但其实 一切都改变了
en:And the lagoonwas surrounded by palm trees,as you can see, and a few mangrove.And it had tilapiaabout 20 centimeters,a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.And the fisheries for this tilapiasustained lots of fish and they had a good timeand they earned more than averagein Ghana.When I went there 27 years later,the fish had shrunk to half of their size.They were maturing at five centimeters.They had been pushed genetically.There were still fishes.They were still kind of happy.And the fish also were happy to be there.So nothing has changed,but everything has changed.

zh-cn:第三个故事讲的是将拖网捕捞引入非洲东南部的有我一份在七十年代—其实是六十年代初期—欧洲进行了许多发展项目渔业发展意味着强迫渔民人数在达十万人的国家进行工业捕鱼这艘船 挺难看的叫Mutiara 4号我乘上这艘船我们一路做调查沿着中国南海尤其是爪哇海我们捕捞到了叫不出名字的东西现在我知道了 我们捞到的是海底的生物百分之九十是海绵以及其他固定在海底的动物实际上 大多数鱼就是那堆杂物中的小点它们是生活在珊瑚礁中的鱼海底被端上了甲板后来又被扔下去
en:My third little storyis that I was an accomplicein the introduction of trawlingin Southeast Asia.In the &#39;70s — well, beginning in the &#39;60s —Europe did lots of development projects.Fish developmentmeant imposing on countriesthat had already 100,000 fishersto impose on them industrial fishing.And this boat, quite ugly,is called the Mutiara 4.And I went sailing on it,and we did surveysthroughout the southern South China seaand especially the Java Sea.And what we caught,we didn&#39;t have words for it.What we caught, I know now,is the bottom of the sea.And 90 percent of our catchwere sponges,other animals that are fixed on the bottom.And actually most of the fish,they are a little spot on the debris,the piles of debris, were coral reef fish.Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deckand then was thrown down.

zh-cn:这些照片意义非凡因为这个变化过程非常快不到一年 你再进行调查接着渔业又开始了海底发生了变化坚硬的海底或柔软的珊瑚变成了一滩泥泞这是一只死了的海龟它们没有被吃掉 而是因为死了而被扔掉的有一次 我们捉到一只活的它还没有淹死他们想杀掉它 因为海龟肉很美味这堆积如山的杂物是渔民们捞上来的他们每次进入未经捕捞的海域都能捞到这些东西而这并没有被记录在案
en:And these pictures are extraordinarybecause this transition is very rapid.Within a year, you do a surveyand then commercial fishing begins.The bottom is transformedfrom, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coralinto a muddy mess.This is a dead turtle.They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.And one time we caught a live one.It was not drowned yet.And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.This mountain of debrisis actually collected by fishersevery time they gointo an area that&#39;s never been fished.But it&#39;s not documented.

zh-cn:我们改变了世界但却不认账我们把基准线调整到一个新水平而把之前的水平抛在脑后归纳一下就会出现这样的情况Y轴代表美好的事物生物多样性 逆戟鲸的数量你的国家的绿化 水资源供应随着时间的变化而变化之所以变化是因为人们的活动或自然的变化每代人都会以他们有意识之初的画面作为标准并往前推测所产生的差距他们视为一种损失但他们没有把之前发生的事情视为一种损失一系列变化发生了最后你希望保住最后可怜的幸存者而这在很大程度上 就是我们现在要做的我们想要保护那些消失殆尽的东西或者那些发生了变化的东西
en:We transform the world,but we don&#39;t remember it.We adjust our baselineto the new level,and we don&#39;t recall what was there.If you generalize this,something like this happens.You have on the y axis some good thing:biodiversity, numbers of orca,the greenness of your country, the water supply.And over time it changes —it changesbecause people do things, or naturally.Every generationwill use the imagesthat they got at the beginning of their conscious livesas a standardand will extrapolate forward.And the difference then,they perceive as a loss.But they don&#39;t perceive what happened before as a loss.You can have a succession of changes.At the end you want to sustainmiserable leftovers.And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.We want to sustain things that are goneor things that are not the way they were.

zh-cn:现在人们应当认为在一个弱肉强食的社会中这个问题当然会对人产生影响他们捕杀动物而直到几代人之后才意识到他们的所作所为因为 很显然在一种动物灭绝或濒临灭绝前这种动物的数量还是很多的所以你不会失去数量多的动物物种你失去的是珍稀动物所以这些动物的消失不会被视为重大损失随着时间推移我们关注大型动物在海洋中 这指的是大型鱼类我们捕捞鱼类致使它们的数量越来越少一段时间时候 我们只剩下少数鱼了我们就把这个数量看做基准线
en:Now one should thinkthis problem affected peoplecertainly when in predatory societies,they killed animalsand they didn&#39;t know they had done soafter a few generations.Because, obviously,an animal that is very abundant,before it gets extinct,it becomes rare.So you don&#39;t lose abundant animals.You always lose rare animals.And therefore they&#39;re not perceivedas a big loss.Over time,we concentrate on large animals,and in a sea that means the big fish.They become rarer because we fish them.Over time we have a few fish leftand we think this is the baseline.

zh-cn:问题是人们为什么对此安之若素呢这是因为他们不知道情况变化了事实上 许多人 尤其是科学家反对这种意见他们反对是因为早前的分析模型中所呈现的证据方式并不是他们想要的呈现方式举个例子有人讲了一个故事说某某船长发现这个地区有很多鱼这个故事不能拿来当证据渔业科学家通常也不会采纳这个故事因为它不够“科学”这就造成了一个情况：人们对过去一无所知尽管 我们生活在文明社会中因为他们不相信关于过去的信息来源
en:And the question is,why do people accept this?Well because they don&#39;t know that it was different.And in fact, lots of people, scientists,will contest that it was really different.And they will contest thisbecause the evidencepresented in an earlier modeis not in the waythey would like the evidence presented.For example,the anecdote that some present,as Captain so-and-soobserved lots of fish in this areacannot be usedor is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,because it&#39;s not &quot;scientific.&quot;So you have a situationwhere people don&#39;t know the past,even though we live in literate societies,because they don&#39;t trustthe sources of the past.

zh-cn:他们也不了解一个海洋保护区域的重大角色因为 我们实际上是通过海洋保护区来重塑过去我们重塑了过去 让人们无法设想过去的情况因为基准线变动了变得极低这适用于那些看到一片海洋保护区的人和那些从其中的深层意义获益的人这让他们有能力重置他们的基准线
en:And hence, the enormous rolethat a marine protected area can play.Because with marine protected areas,we actually recreate the past.We recreate the past that people cannot conceivebecause the baseline has shiftedand is extremely low.That is for peoplewho can see a marine protected areaand who can benefitfrom the insight that it provides,which enables them to reset their baseline.

zh-cn:那么那些没有能力这么做的人呢他们没法知道例如中西部地区的人们我想艺术作品和电影可以填补这个空缺还有原态模拟这是切萨皮克湾的原态模拟很久以前 有灰鲸生活在切萨皮克湾那是五百年前你会注意到上面的色调酷似“阿凡达”（众人笑）一想到“阿凡达”一想到人们为何会为之动容风中奇缘的故事就不说了为何人们会被里面的画面所打动这是因为它激发了我们遗失了的某样东西我建议这也是我唯一的建议希望卡梅隆的“阿凡达2”能在水下拍摄
en:How about the people who can&#39;t do thatbecause they have no access —the people in the Midwest for example?There I thinkthat the arts and filmcan perhaps fill the gap,and simulation.This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago —500 years ago.And you will have noticed that the hues and tonesare like &quot;Avatar.&quot;(Laughter)And if you think about &quot;Avatar,&quot;if you think of why people were so touched by it —never mind the Pocahontas story —why so touched by the imagery?Because it evokes somethingthat in a sense has been lost.And so my recommendation,it&#39;s the only one I will provide,is for Cameron to do &quot;Avatar II&quot; underwater.
