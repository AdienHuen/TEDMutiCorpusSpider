zh-cn:我想从这儿开始。这是一个手写告示在数年前出现在布鲁克林我住过的旧社区里一个家庭式面包店里店中的机器中有一台可以用糖打印图文的机器孩子们会带着画来让面包店在他们的生日蛋糕上画上一幅糖画。
en:I&#39;m going to start here.This is a hand-lettered signthat appeared in a mom and pop bakeryin my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.The store owned one of those machinesthat can print on plates of sugar.And kids could bring in drawingsand have the store print a sugar platefor the top of their birthday cake.

zh-cn:但不幸地是，孩子们最喜欢画的东西之一就是卡通人物。他们喜欢画小美人鱼，蓝精灵，米老鼠。但结果，把一副孩子画的米老鼠画做成糖画竟是非法的并且侵犯了版权监管孩子生日蛋糕的版权侵犯真是个麻烦事学院面包店如是说，“你知道么，这个业务我们不能再提供了如果你是个外行你可不能擅用我们的机器。如果你制作一份带糖画的生日蛋糕，你必须用从我们的预制图像中选取一个 ——机器只对专业人士开放。”
en:But unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to drawwas cartoon characters.They liked to draw the Little Mermaid,they&#39;d like to draw a smurf, they&#39;d like to draw Micky Mouse.But it turns out to be illegalto print a child&#39;s drawing of Micky Mouseonto a plate of sugar.And it&#39;s a copyright violation.And policing copyright violationsfor children&#39;s birthday cakeswas such a hasslethat the College Bakery said,&quot;You know what, we&#39;re getting out of that business.If you&#39;re an amateur,you don&#39;t have access to our machine anymore.If you want a printed sugar birthday cake,you have to use one of our prefab images —only for professionals.&quot;

zh-cn:这是目前国会的两个议案。一个名为SOPA，另一个名为PIPA。SOPA表示禁止网络盗版法案（Stop Online Piracy Act）。它出自参议院。PIPA是PROTECTIP的缩写，这本身又是防止实时在线对经济创新能力的威胁和对知识产权的盗窃法案的缩写——提出这些法案的国会助手有着大把的时间。SOPA和PIPA想做的就是他们想做的。他们想把遵守版权的成本提高到某个程度，这样外行人就直接无法参与了
en:So there&#39;s two bills in Congress right now.One is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.It&#39;s from the Senate.PIPA is short for PROTECTIP,which is itself short forPreventing Real Online Threatsto Economic Creativityand Theft of Intellectual Property —because the congressional aides who name these thingshave a lot of time on their hands.And what SOPA and PIPA want to dois they want to do this.They want to raise the costof copyright complianceto the point where people simply get out of the businessof offering it as a capability to amateurs.

zh-cn:现在他们的方法是识别出那些严重侵犯版权的网站 ——但是到底怎么鉴别这些网站法案到说得不明不白—识别后他们就要删除其域名把他们的域名删了域名系统就是把我们能读的名字，比如Google.com转化成机器阅读的地址－74.125.226.212
en:Now the way they propose to do thisis to identify sitesthat are substantially infringing on copyright —although how those sites are identifiedis never fully specified in the bills —and then they want to remove them from the domain name system.They want to take them out of the domain name system.Now the domain name systemis the thing that turns human-readable names, like Google.com,into the kinds of addressesmachines expect —74.125.226.212.
时间： 2:22
zh-cn:这个审查模式的问题是鉴定一个网站然后移除其域名这根本行不通而且在法律上来说也相当棘手但是国会似乎根本不操心这个这个方法不奏效的原因是如果你在浏览器输入74.125.226.212或者做一个链接你仍然能打开谷歌所以这个问题的监管层面是这个法案本身最大的问题
en:Now the problem with this model of censorship,of identifying a siteand then trying to remove it from the domain name system,is that it won&#39;t work.And you&#39;d think that would be a pretty big problem for a law,but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much.Now the reason it won&#39;t workis that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browseror you can make it a clickable linkand you&#39;ll still go to Google.So the policing layeraround the problembecomes the real threat of the act.
时间： 2:55
zh-cn:国会是怎么写了一个自己没法达成目标还导致负面效果的法案呢你得再深入了解点此问题这个问题的背景就是SOPA和PIPA的立法主要是由上世纪成立的媒体公司起草的20世纪的媒体公司风华正茂的时候因为他们掌握着稀缺资源如果拍个电视根本不必做得比以前的好只要比另两家的电视好就成了同时放映的只有这么多－这个对竞争难度是个很低的门槛也就是说你只要作出平均水平的东西就有了全美三分之一的观众－那可是上千万人只要简单做点东西不太烂就可以了这就好像有印钞的许可证还有一桶免费的墨水
en:Now to understand how Congress came to write a billthat won&#39;t accomplish its stated goals,but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects,you have to understand a little bit about the back story.And the back story is this:SOPA and PIPA, as legislation,were drafted largely by media companiesthat were founded in the 20th century.The 20th century was a great time to be a media company,because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.If you were making a TV show,it didn&#39;t have to be better than all other TV shows ever made;it only had to be betterthan the two other showsthat were on at the same time —which is a very low thresholdof competitive difficulty.Which meantthat if you fielded average content,you got a third of the U.S. public for free —tens of millions of usersfor simply doing somethingthat wasn&#39;t too terrible.This is like having a license to print moneyand a barrel of free ink.

zh-cn:但是技术在发展，一直在进步渐渐地，到了20世纪末稀缺性坐吃山空—我不是说数字技术我是说模拟技术磁带录像带，录像机甚至是不起眼的复印机提供给我们新机会让媒体行业大大吃了一惊因为不是每个人都窝在沙发上看电视我们不愿意只做消费者我们的确喜欢消费但每当有新工具问世我们就希望做出点什么来分享这可让媒体行业不爽了－每次都是杰克･瓦伦蒂是美国电影协会的首席说客他有次把盒带式录像机比喻成开膛手杰克把可怜的无助的好莱坞比喻成独自在家的女人就是这么比喻的
en:But technology moved on, as technology is wont to do.And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century,that scarcity started to get eroded —and I don&#39;t mean by digital technology;I mean by analog technology.Cassette tapes, video cassette recorders,even the humble Xerox machinecreated new opportunitiesfor us to behave in waysthat astonished the media business.Because it turned outwe&#39;re not really couch potatoes.We don&#39;t really like to only consume.We do like to consume,but every time one of these new tools came along,it turned out we also like to produceand we like to share.And this freaked the media businesses out —it freaked them out every time.Jack Valenti, who was the head lobbyistfor the Motion Picture Association of America,once likened the ferocious video cassette recorderto Jack the Ripperand poor, helpless Hollywoodto a woman at home alone.That was the level of rhetoric.

zh-cn:媒体行业乞求，强调，要求国会得做点什么国会确实做了九十年代初国会通过了一个法案改变了一切该法案就是1992年的《家庭录制法》1992年的《家庭录制法》规定如果人们自己录像然后和朋友分享这不是犯罪，没事录像，制作和朋友分享是可以的但是如果制作很多高质量的然后出售就不行了但是录像的行为就放行吧他们觉得话说得很明白了因为他们划清了合法和非法翻拍的界线
en:And so the media industriesbegged, insisted, demandedthat Congress do something.And Congress did something.By the early 90s, Congress passed the lawthat changed everything.And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Actof 1992.What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was,look, if people are taping stuff off the radioand then making mixtapes for their friends,that is not a crime. That&#39;s okay.Taping and remixingand sharing with your friends is okay.If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them,that&#39;s not okay.But this taping business,fine, let it go.And they thought that they clarified the issue,because they&#39;d set out a clear distinctionbetween legal and illegal copying.
时间： 5:41
zh-cn:但那可不是媒体行业想的他们要的是国会禁止翻拍行为所以当1992年《家庭录制法》通过的时候媒体行业放弃了划定合法和非法翻拍行为的想法因为很明显如果国会真的执行的话这可能反而促使更多人参与媒体活动他们另辟蹊径找到这另一个法子不容易
en:But that wasn&#39;t what the media businesses wanted.They had wanted Congressto outlaw copying full-stop.So when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed,the media businesses gave up on the ideaof legal versus illegal distinctions for copyingbecause it was clearthat if Congress was acting in their framework,they might actually increase the rights of citizensto participate in our own media environment.So they went for plan B.It took them a while to formulate plan B.

zh-cn:这个方法1998年终于全面问世称作《数字千年著作权法案》这个立法内容非常复杂，有很多灵活的部分但是DMCA的杀手锏是销售不可复制的数字内容是合法的－但是根本就不存在不可复制的数字内容阿就像爱德･费尔顿说的“像泼出不湿的水一样。”比特位是可以复制的，这是电脑的功能这是电脑正常操作的一个副产品
en:Plan B appeared in its first full-blown formin 1998 —something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.It was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.But the main thrust of the DMCAwas that it was legal to sell youuncopyable digital material —except that there&#39;s no such things as uncopyable digital material.It would be, as Ed Felton once famously said,&quot;Like handing out waterthat wasn&#39;t wet.&quot;Bits are copyable. That&#39;s what computers do.That is a side effect of their ordinary operation.
时间： 6:43
zh-cn:所以假装存在出售无法复制的比特位的可能DMCA也把强制你使用可破坏设备复制功能的系统定为合法你买回家的DVD播放器和游戏机还有电视电脑－无论买的时候你以为会有什么东西到手—都可能被内容供应商破坏如果他们想以此作为出售给你内容的条件的话为了确保你不知情或者说不让他们的条款对一般性的电子设备适用他们还规定重新设置内容的复制性设置也是违法的DMCA标志着媒体行业放弃了用法律手段来区分合法和非法复制而是采用技术手段来防止复制
en:So in order to fake the abilityto sell uncopyable bits,the DMCA also made it legalto force you to use systemsthat broke the copying function of your devices.Every DVD player and game playerand television and computer you brought home —no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it —could be broken by the content industries,if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.And to make sure you didn&#39;t realize,or didn&#39;t enact their capabilitiesas general purpose computing devices,they also made it illegalfor you to try to resetthe copyability of that content.The DMCA marks the momentwhen the media industriesgave up on the legal systemof distinguishing between legal and illegal copyingand simply tried to prevent copyingthrough technical means.
时间： 7:37
zh-cn:DMCA产生了很多复杂的作用但在网域限制分享的范围内它是不适用的不适用的原因是互联网的流行及其力量远超人们的想象自制录像 爱好者杂志这些有了互联网就完全不一样了我们身处的世界大多数12岁以上的美国人在线上与别人分享我们分享文稿，图片声频，视频分享的东西有些是我们制作的有些是我们找到的有些是在那些找到的东西上加工出来的这可让媒体行业吓坏了
en:Now the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects,but in this one domain, limiting sharing,it has mostly not worked.And the main reason it hasn&#39;t workedis the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerfulthan anyone imagined.The mixtape, the fanzine,that was nothing compared to what we&#39;re seeing nowwith the Internet.We are in a worldwhere most American citizensover the age of 12share things with each other online.We share written things, we share images,we share audio, we share video.Some of the stuff we share is stuff we&#39;ve made.Some of the stuff we share is stuff we&#39;ve found.Some of the stuff we shareis stuff we&#39;ve made out of what we&#39;ve found,and all of it horrifies those industries.
时间： 8:22
zh-cn:PIPA和SOPA可是第二回合但好比DMCA是外科手术式的要进入你的电脑你的电视机，还有游戏机并且阻止店员告诉你它们的功能PIPA和SOPA就好比是核武器他们要插手世界上每一个角落去审查内容现在用于此目的的机制是移除任何一个指向IP地址的人把他们移出搜索引擎移出线上目录从用户名单里删除因为线上内容的最大生产者既不是谷歌也不是雅虎而是我们是我们被管制了因为说到底实施PIPA和SOPA的真正威胁是我们与他人分享的能力
en:So PIPA and SOPAare round two.But where the DMCA was surgical —we want to go down into your computer,we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine,and prevent it from doingwhat they said it would do at the store —PIPA and SOPA are nuclearand they&#39;re saying, we want to go anywhere in the worldand censor content.Now the mechanism, as I said, for doing this,is you need to take out anybodypointing to those IP addresses.You need to take them out of search engines,you need to take them out of online directories,you need to take them out of user lists.And because the biggest producers of content on the Internetare not Google and Yahoo,they&#39;re us,we&#39;re the people getting policed.Because in the end,the real threatto the enactment of PIPA and SOPAis our ability to share things with one another.
时间： 9:23
zh-cn:PIPA和SOPA是在逆行倒施把一个几百年来的法律概念及“无罪推定”的概念反过来－变成“有罪推定”除非你能证明你分享的东西是我们允许的否则就不能分享这样一来，区分有罪无罪的证据负担就落到了我们身上以及那些提供我们分享功能的服务商身上就算一名使用者只需一毛钱成本来管制那么成千上万的使用者无疑会压垮一个服务商
en:So what PIPA and SOPA risk doingis taking a centuries-old legal concept,innocent until proven guilty,and reversing it —guilty until proven innocent.You can&#39;t shareuntil you show usthat you&#39;re not sharing somethingwe don&#39;t like.Suddenly, the burden of proof for legal versus illegalfalls affirmatively on usand on the servicesthat might be offering us any new capabilities.And if it costs even a dimeto police a user,that will crush a servicewith a hundred million users.
时间：10:03
zh-cn:这就是他们理想的互联网想象一下这个标示随处可见的样子－除了想象它不是叫学院面包房想象一下如果是YouTube脸书和推特如果是TED因为评论管制的成本无可估量SOPA和PIPA的实际效果和预期效果是不同的真正的威胁是供证的逆转我们突然成了做贼的只要我们尝试自由地创作和分享而提供此功能的人们YouTube，脸书，推特或者TED此类种种就不得不管制我们或者被牵连构成间接侵权
en:So this is the Internet they have in mind.Imagine this sign everywhere —except imagine it doesn&#39;t say College Bakery,imagine it says YouTubeand Facebook and Twitter.Imagine it says TED,because the comments can&#39;t be policedat any acceptable cost.The real effects of SOPA and PIPAare going to be different than the proposed effects.The threat, in fact,is this inversion of the burden of proof,where we suddenlyare all treated like thievesat every moment we&#39;re given the freedom to create,to produce or to share.And the people who provide those capabilities to us —the YouTubes, the Facebooks, the Twitters and TEDs —are in the businessof having to police us,or being on the hook for contributory infringement.

zh-cn:有两件事你可以来帮助阻止这一切－一个简单一个复杂一个容易一个困难这个简单容易的事就是如果你是美国公民告诉你的众议员和参议员当你看到共同签署SOPA法案的人共同签署PIPA法案的人他们从传统媒体逐渐地收受了数以百万的钱财你没有那么多钱但你可以告诉那些参议员提醒他们你握着投票权你可以要求不被作对一个贼来对待你可以建议你宁愿要一个健全的互联网
en:There&#39;s two things you can doto help stop this —a simple thing and a complicated thing,an easy thing and a hard thing.The simple thing, the easy thing, is this:if you&#39;re an American citizen,call your representative, call your senator.When you look atthe people who co-signed on the SOPA bill,people who&#39;ve co-signed on PIPA,what you see is that they have cumulatively receivedmillions and millions of dollarsfrom the traditional media industries.You don&#39;t have millions and millions of dollars,but you can call your representatives,and you can remind them that you vote,and you can ask not to be treated like a thief,and you can suggest that you would preferthat the Internet not be broken.
时间：11:44
zh-cn:如果你不是美国公民你可以告诉你认识的美国公民劝他们这么做因为这个虽然看上去是美国国内的问题但不是的打击互联网是不能满足传统媒体产业的如果他们打击了互联网，每个人都会受到损害这是容易的这件事简单的一件事
en:And if you&#39;re not an American citizen,you can contact American citizens that you knowand encourage them to do the same.Because this seems like a national issue,but it is not.These industries will not be contentwith breaking our Internet.If they break it, they will break it for everybody.That&#39;s the easy thing.That&#39;s the simple thing.
时间：12:05
zh-cn:难的是因为有更多的还在等着我们SOPA是COICA的简版COICA是去年提出的，没有通过这个源于DMCA没有能够禁止分享技术手段的失败而DMCA又是源于《家庭录制法》那是让那些公司闻之胆寒的事因为如果某人违反了那个条例然后举证并证明的整个过程非常麻烦“我们不太喜欢那么干”内容提供商如此自述他们真正想要的是不必那么干他们不想在合法和非法分享间有明确的司法界定他们只是想让分享彻底消失
en:The hard thing is this:get ready, because more is coming.SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA,which was purposed last year, which did not pass.And all of this goes backto the failure of the DMCAto disallow sharing as a technical means.And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act,which horrified those industries.Because the whole businessof actually suggesting that someone is breaking the lawand then gathering evidence and proving that,that turns out to be really inconvenient.&quot;We&#39;d prefer not to do that,&quot;says the content industries.And what they want is not to have to do that.They don&#39;t want legal distinctionsbetween legal and illegal sharing.They just want the sharing to go away.
时间：12:49
zh-cn:PIPA和SOPA不是异想天开，不是异常现象也不是个体事件它们是给螺丝又上紧了一圈而这已经持续了二十年如果我们反抗的话，我希望我们能还有更多的等着直到我们能说服国会处理侵犯版权的做法应该像处理Napster和YouTube的侵权那样也就是在民主社会中通过举证，核对事实和补救措施评估的审讯的做法这才是正确的做法
en:PIPA and SOPA are not oddities, they&#39;re not anomalies,they&#39;re not events.They&#39;re the next turn of this particular screw,which has been going on 20 years now.And if we defeat these, as I hope we do,more is coming.Because until we convince Congressthat the way to deal with copyright violationis the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster, with YouTube,which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidenceand the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remediesthat goes on in democratic societies.That&#39;s the way to handle this.
时间：13:25
zh-cn:同时困难之处还有要做好准备这是PIPA和SOPA的真正要传达的信息时代华纳曾呼吁要我们坐回沙发上去单纯消费—别去创作，分享—我们应该说“不。”
en:In the meantime,the hard thing to do is to be ready.Because that&#39;s the real message of PIPA and SOPA.Time Warner has calledand they want us all back on the couch,just consuming —not producing, not sharing —and we should say, &quot;No.&quot;
