zh-cn:我能成为一个发明家， 纯属偶然1956年我从空军退役。不，我说错了是1956年服役，1959年退役退役后在华盛顿大学工作我在看一篇杂志文章时冒出个想法想发明一种新的留声机拾音臂相比今天的录音带 CD DVD等很酷的产品那可以说是古董级的了它是一个臂用以代替读盘时铰链和枢轴的功能直截了当的说：放射式直线循迹拾音臂这是我做过最难的一个发明，但是它促使我开始之后我就一帆风顺了
en:I became an inventor by accident.I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that&#39;s not true:I went in in 1956, came out in 1959,was working at the University of Washington,and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article,for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs —any of the cool stuff we&#39;ve got now.And it was an arm that,instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record,went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started,and I got really lucky after that.

zh-cn:不长篇大论了今天我给大家带来的是我的第44个发明。不，又错了天啊，我今天完全不在状态我的第44个专利，第15个发明我称之为特超声我先播放几分钟给你们听但是在这之前我要先道歉通常，我播放这个特超声后人们都会说确实很酷，但是有什么用呢？我则会说，那灯泡有什么用呢？我用声和光来举例爱迪生发明的灯泡，和这个差不多并没有太大的改进光向各个方向照射在发明灯泡以前人们已经懂得，在其后面放一个反射器聚焦效果就会好些前面再放一个透镜效果会更好些最终，我们掌握了如何制造激光那就是完全聚焦
en:And without giving you too much of a tirade,I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today:my 44th invention. No, that&#39;s not true either.Golly, I&#39;m just totally losing it.My 44th patent; about the 15th invention.I call this hypersonic sound.I&#39;m going to play it for you in a couple minutes,but I want to make an analogy before I doto this.I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say,That&#39;s really cool, but what&#39;s it good for?And I say, What is the light bulb good for?Sound, light: I&#39;m going to draw the analogy.When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.Hasn&#39;t changed that much.Light came out of it in every direction.Before the light bulb was invented,people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it,focus it a little bit;put lenses in front of it,focus it a little bit better.Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasersthat were totally focused.

zh-cn:现在想象下，如果我们只有灯泡而不懂得聚焦如今的世界会是什么样子你开灯后，光向任意方向照射喇叭就和这个差不多你打开喇叭在这个玩意已经被发明了80多年后声音还是像当初那样传播就算你站在麦克风前面传播的方向基本上也是任意方向有一点点差别，但不是很多如果灯泡和喇叭一样不能聚焦或限定它我们就不能播放幻灯片，电影电脑或电视机又或者CD和DVD，等等等等其重要的特征都是能聚焦
en:Now, think about where the world would be todayif we had the light bulb,but you couldn&#39;t focus light;if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.That&#39;s the way loudspeakers pretty much are.You turn on the loudspeaker,and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets,the sound just kind of goes where it wants.Even when you&#39;re standing in front of a megaphone,it&#39;s pretty much every direction.A little bit of differential, but not much.If the light bulb was the way the speaker is,and you couldn&#39;t focus or sharpen the edges or define it,we wouldn&#39;t have that, or movies in general,or computers, or T.V. sets,or C.D.s, or DVDs — and just go down the listof what the importance isof being able to focus light.

zh-cn:在喇叭发明了80年后的今天我认为是时候掌握如何将声音按照你们想要的方式传播了我带来了一组设备这是用来演示的，我昨天早上做的底特律的一家知名汽车制造商想把它们安装在汽车上一个小的型号，可以戴在头上这样你就可以在汽车里面享受到真正的立体声如果我能像瞄准光一样瞄准声音会怎么样？
en:Now, after almost 80 years of having sound,I thought it was about time that we figure outa way to put sound where you want to.I have a couple of units.That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the dayfor a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car —small version, over your head —so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.What if I could aim sound the way I aim light?

zh-cn:这是我在我家后院录的声音现在，除非我对准你，否则你是听不到的也可能是我对准了侧壁，然后声波在屋内回荡（鼓掌）声音就在你耳边产生，很酷吧？（鼓掌）因为时间有限，我中断一会来讲解下它的原理和用途
en:I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard.Now, you&#39;re not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.(Applause)The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?(Applause)Because I have some limited time, I&#39;ll cut it off for a second,and tell you about how it works and what it&#39;s good for.

zh-cn:当然，能像光一样用声音勾勒出晾衣架，或者玉米片、牙膏又或电影院大厅的公告板太好了索尼有一个想法—索尼是我们目前最大的客户60年代他们试过这些想法但是由于太超前了，他们只能放弃但是他们还是想使用这些发明，真的一个发明家必须是全才你必须非常聪明虽然我不是大学毕业，但是不代表我笨在这个世界上，太笨就会被淘汰因为聪明的人太多了我只是恰巧通过另一种方式接受教育我不是完全反对教育我认为教育很好，只是认为有时候人们去接受教育，却失去了教育过于自大，以至于不稀罕其他事物，因为他们认为自己更好我们现在生活的时代很好因为几乎所有东西都被重新探究过我有一个用很多次的口号，就是一无所有我是认真的至今没有发明任何东西我们仅仅在摸索的开端我们对自然法则、科学、物理的探索才刚刚开始对于所掌握的，我希望，只是冰山一角
en:Course, like light, it&#39;s great to be able to put soundto highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste,or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby.Sony&#39;s got an idea — Sony&#39;s our biggest customers right now.They tried this back in the &#39;60sand were too smart, and so they gave up.But they want to use it — seriously.There&#39;s a mix an inventor has to have.You have to be kind of smart,and though I did not graduate from college doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m stupid,because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today.Too many other smart people out there. So.I just happened to get my education in a little different way.I&#39;m not at all against education.I think it&#39;s wonderful; I think sometimes people,when they get educated, lose it:they get so smart they&#39;re unwilling to look at things that they know better than.And we&#39;re living in a great time right now,because almost everything&#39;s being explored anew.I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is:virtually nothing —and I mean this honestly —has been invented yet.We&#39;re just starting.We&#39;re just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics.And this is, I hope, a little piece of it.

zh-cn:索尼开阔了眼界，并使我步入正轨当你站在超市的结账口时你要看一个特别的电视频道他们知道当你在家看电视时由于你有很多的选择你可以换台，跳过他们的广告每天有1.5亿人要站在超市的结账口如今，这个他们采用多年的方法出现问题了因为，收银员厌倦了听重复的信息每20分钟就循环一次大家知道 ，广告是促销的有效手段例如，当你在候机厅时你可以免费欣赏电影但如果要听声音，你就需要购买所以ABC和索尼设计了一项新的试验当你走进超市的结账口时最初将在西韦夫商店试验现在在全国的三家西韦夫商店测试你还是要观看电视频道
en:Sony&#39;s got this vision back — to get myself on track —that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket,you&#39;re going to watch a new T.V. channel.They know that when you watch T.V. at home,because there are so many choicesyou can change channels, miss their commercials.A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.Now, they&#39;ve tried this a couple years ago and it failed,because the checker gets tired of hearing the same messageevery 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.And, you know, if the sound isn&#39;t there, the sale typically isn&#39;t made.For instance, like, when you&#39;re on an airplane, they show the movie,you get to watch it for free;when you want to hear the sound, you pay.And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thingwhere when you step in the line in the supermarket —initially it&#39;ll be Safeways. It is Safeways;they&#39;re trying this in three parts of the country right now —you&#39;ll be watching TV.

zh-cn:但幸运的是，他们这次做的很谨慎因为他们不想让你再次被一个输出声音而干扰这个设计的的好亮点是如果你不想听声音你向旁边侧一步就听不到了因此 ，我们制造声音，但同时我们也创造安静ATM机和你对话时，别人无法听到凌晨两点，你坐在床上看电视你的爱人，或其他人还在旁边睡觉就听不到，也不会被吵醒我们同样致力于消除噪音，像鼾声或汽车的噪音
en:And hopefully they&#39;ll be sensitivethat they don&#39;t want to offend you with just one more outlet.But what&#39;s great about it, from the tests that have been done, is,if you don&#39;t want to hear it,you take about one step to the side and you don&#39;t hear it.So, we create silence as much as we create sound.ATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.Sit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV;your spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep;doesn&#39;t hear it, doesn&#39;t wake up.We&#39;re also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.

zh-cn:这项技术确实给我带来了好运当这项技术成熟了，这个世界也就准备好了接受他们甚至在我们门前排起了队我们从去年的九、十月份就开始发售这项技术销量非常不错如果你对价格感兴趣，但今天不卖这套设备，包括电子器件和其他所有的零件每套售价在1000美元左右我们希望在明年的这个时候价格可以降到几百美元相比家用电器，这一点都不贵
en:I have been really lucky with this technology:all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.They have literally beat a path to our door.We&#39;ve been selling it since about last September, October,and it&#39;s been immensely gratifying.If you&#39;re interested in what it costs — I&#39;m not selling them today —but this unit, with the electronics and everything,if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.We expect by this time next year,it&#39;ll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it.It&#39;s not any more pricey than regular electronics.

zh-cn:现在，当我播放时，你们听不到嘈杂的低声这组设备播放的声音可以达到200赫兹，超过了听觉范围实际上它是在发射超声波，低电平的超声波振动频率是每秒十万次你现在听到的声音和在表面制造声音的普通喇叭不同这个是外部，在空气中制造声音正如我们一直被告诉的，空气是非线性的把音量稍微调高一点我的意思是略高于80分贝突然之间空气开始将传播的信号扭曲化原因是：声速不是常数。相当慢但是声速根据温度和气压的变化而变化
en:Now, when I played it for you, you didn&#39;t hear the thunderous bass.This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.It&#39;s actually emitting ultrasound — low-level ultrasound —that&#39;s about 100,000 vibrations per second.And the sound that you&#39;re hearing,unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face,is made out in front of it, in the air.The air is not linear, as we&#39;ve always been taught.You turn up the volume just a little bit —I&#39;m talking about a little over 80 decibels —and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.Here&#39;s why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It&#39;s fairly slow.It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.

zh-cn:现在，想象一下不用任何高科技水段我在空气中制造一些正弦波如果我将振幅调的过大则会对气压产生影响也就是说在制造正弦波的同时声音的传播速度发生了变化我们常见的广播是力图接近完美的线性化线性化意味着更好的音质特超声则完全相反它属于完全的非线性它也作用于空气，但是是相反的效果这就是特超声但是它是可预测的你可以制造精确的广播来消除这种影响
en:Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical,I&#39;m making a little sine wave here in the air.Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much,I&#39;m having an effect on the pressure,which means during the making of that sine wave,the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.All of audio as we know itis an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.Linearity means higher quality sound.Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite:it&#39;s 100 percent based on non-linearity.An effect happens in the air, it&#39;s a corrupting effect of the sound —the ultrasound in this case — that&#39;s emitted,but it&#39;s so predictablethat you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.

zh-cn:现在的问题是，那么声音从何而来？不是在这个表面形成而是沿着空气中这条狭窄的带数亿计独立的点而形成的所以当我把它对准你你听到的声音就在耳边形成我说过我们可以缩短这条带我们可以将其扩散以覆盖整排座椅我可以将其设置成只一支耳朵听一个喇叭而另一只听的是其他的声音，这才是真正的立体声当你用家庭影院的音响时你两耳听到的都是一个喇叭的声音就算只打开左边的喇叭你右耳还是能听到左边喇叭的声音而剧院的情况就更糟了剧院的声音是在你的前方散播因为声音时沿着空气中这条带形成它不遵循平方反比定律也就是说距离每增加一倍它就会减弱大约三分之二例如：你从1米走到2米，声音就会减弱6分贝而现在，你去听摇滚音乐会或交响乐会时前排和后排享受到的效果是一样的了不起吧？
en:Now, the question is, where&#39;s the sound made?Instead of being made on the face of the cone,it&#39;s made at literally billions of little independent pointsalong this narrow column in the air,and so when I aim it towards you,what you hear is made right next to your ears.I said we can shorten the column,we can spread it out to cover the couch.I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker,the other ear hears the other. That&#39;s true binaural sound.When you listen to stereo on your home system,your both ears hear both speakers.Turn on the left speaker sometimeand notice you&#39;re hearing it also in your right ear.So, the stage is more restricted —the sound stage that&#39;s supposed to spread out in front of you.Because the sound is made in the air along this column,it does not follow the inverse square law,which says it drops off about two thirdsevery time you double the distance:6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony,and the guy in the front row gets the same levelas the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.Isn&#39;t that terrific?

zh-cn:所以，正如我所说的，非常成功也非常幸运很多公司对这个发明感兴趣汽车制造商想为儿童在汽车的前排安装一个音响系统在后排再另装一个独立的系统噢，不，儿童是禁止驾驶的（观众笑）我是在试探你们是不是睡着了实际上，我还没有吃早餐为大人在前排安装一个立体音响系统在后排为孩子们装一个迷你的DVD播放器这样父母就不会被后排的DVD或者摇滚音乐或其他的东西所打扰因此，随心所欲控制声音的想法正在开始变成现实它还可以应用于数据的传送和通信传播的速度比在水下的快4倍
en:So, we&#39;ve been, as I say, very successful, very lucky,in having companies catch the vision of this,from cars — car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids,and a separate system in the back —oh, no, the kids aren&#39;t driving today.(Laughter)I was seeing if you were listening.Actually, I haven&#39;t had breakfast yet.A stereo system in the front for mom and dad,and maybe there&#39;s a little DVD player in the back for the kids,and the parents don&#39;t want to be bothered with that,or their rap music or whatever.So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want tois really starting to catch on.It also works for transmitting and communicating data.It also works five times better underwater.

And they have these infrared devicesthat can look at their countenance,and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shiftfrom 100 yards away when they play this thing.And so, another way of hopefully determining who&#39;s friendly and who isn&#39;t.We make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels.Pain is 120.So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people,and there can be a public beach just off to the side,and they don&#39;t even know it&#39;s turned on.We sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars,and they&#39;re buying them as fast as we can make them.We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you,you&#39;re over there, and it&#39;s there.
