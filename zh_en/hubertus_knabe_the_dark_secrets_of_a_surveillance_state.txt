zh-cn:今年，德国正在庆祝前东德和平革命25周年在1989年，共产主义政权垮台柏林墙倒塌，以及一年之后在东边的德意志民主共和国简称GDR与在西边的德意志联邦共和国统一成为今天的德国在所有事项中德国继承了前东德的秘密警察被称为史塔西（国家安全部）在它解体后仅两年它的文档向大众公开像我这样的历史学家开始研究这些文档了解更多关于GDR国家监控如何运作
en:This year, Germany is celebratingthe 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolutionin East Germany.In 1989, the Communist regime was moved away,the Berlin Wall came down, and one year later,the German Democratic Republic, the GDR,in the East was unifiedwith the Federal Republic of Germany in the Westto found today&#39;s Germany.Among many other things, Germany inheritedthe archives of the East German secret police,known as the Stasi.Only two years after its dissolution,its documents were opened to the public,and historians such as me startedto study these documentsto learn more about how the GDR surveillance statefunctioned.

zh-cn:可能你看过这部电影「窃听风暴」这部电影使史塔西世界闻名而我们生活在这样一个时代例如「监控」或「窃听」这种字眼会在新闻首页我很乐意分享现实中史塔西如何运作
en:Perhaps you have watched the movie&quot;The Lives of Others.&quot;This movie made the Stasi known worldwide,and as we live in an age where wordssuch as &quot;surveillance&quot; or &quot;wiretapping&quot;are on the front pages of newspapers,I would like to speak about how the Stasireally worked.

zh-cn:首先，我们简短回顾史塔西的历史因为了解它的自我观很重要它起源于俄罗斯1917年，俄罗斯共产党人建立了肃清反革命和消除怠工紧急委员会简称契卡（肃反委员会）它由费利克斯・捷尔任斯基领导契卡是共产党人建立政权的一个工具通过恐吓群众和处死敌人的方式后来它演变为著名的KGB（苏联国家安全委员会）契卡是史塔西工作人员的楷模他们自称肃反委员会成员甚至你在这里可以见到象徽非常相似事实上，俄罗斯秘密警察是史塔西的创造者和引导人当红军在1945年占领前东德后它马上在前东德扩张不久，它开始训练德国共产党人来建立他们自己的秘密警察顺便一提，我们现在所在的大堂是1946年GDR统治政党成立的地方
en:At the beginning, let&#39;s have a short lookat the history of the Stasi,because it&#39;s really important for understandingits self-conception.Its origins are located in Russia.In 1917, the Russian Communists foundedthe Emergency Commission for CombatingCounter-Revolution and Sabotage,shortly Cheka.It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.The Cheka was an instrument of the Communiststo establish their regime by terrorizing the populationand executing their enemies.It evolved later into the well-known KGB.The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers.They called themselves Chekists,and even the emblem was very similar,as you can see here.In fact, the secret police of Russiawas the creator and instructor of the Stasi.When the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945,it immediately expanded there,and soon it started to train the German Communiststo build up their own secret police.By the way, in this hall where we are now,the ruling party of the GDR was founded in 1946.

zh-cn:五年之后，史塔西成立逐渐地，肮脏的压迫工作交到它手上例如，关押政治囚犯的中央监狱由俄罗斯人建立被史塔西接替使用直到共产主义结束你见到的就是这个监狱刚开始，每一个重要步骤都在俄罗斯人在场时发生但是德国人因高效闻名所以史塔西成长非常迅速早在1953年，它比盖世太保也称纳粹德国的秘密警察拥有更多雇员这个数字每十年翻一倍1989年，多于9万雇员为史塔西工作这意味着一位雇员负责180位居民这在世界上非常罕见
en:Five years later, the Stasi was established,and step by step, the dirty job of oppressionwas handed over to it.For instance, the central jailfor political prisoners,which was established by the Russians,was taken over by the Stasiand used until the end of Communism.You see it here.At the beginning, every important steptook place under the attendance of the Russians.But the Germans are known to be very effective,so the Stasi grew very quickly,and already in 1953, it had more employeesthan the Gestapo had,the secret police of Nazi Germany.The number doubled in each decade.In 1989, more than 90,000 employeesworked for the Stasi.This meant that one employeewas responsible for 180 inhabitants,which was really unique in the world.

zh-cn:在这庞大的机构顶端有一个男人，埃里希・米尔克他统治国家安全部超过30年他是一位及其细心的工作者在过去，他在离这里不远的地方杀了两位警察事实上他定位了史塔西
en:At the top of this tremendous apparatus,there was one man, Erich Mielke.He ruled the Ministry of State Securityfor more than 30 years.He was a scrupulous functionary —in his past, he killed two policemennot far away from here —who in fact personalized the Stasi.

zh-cn:但是史塔西为什么这么独特？首先，它拥有庞大的权力因为它把不同功能统一到一个组织第一点，史塔西是一个情报机构它使用所有可想象的工具来秘密获取情报例如告密者，窃听电话从这张图片你可以看得到还有它不仅活跃在前东德而是全世界第二点，史塔西是秘密警察它可以在大街上拦住路人并且拘捕他们进自己的监狱第三点，史塔西工作像一种公共检查机构它有官方开展初步调查和审问人民的权利最后一点史塔西有自己的军事力量超过1万1千名士兵在所谓警卫团中服役它被建立来粉碎抗议和暴动由于这种中央集权史塔西被称为国家中的国家
en:But what was so exceptional about the Stasi?Foremost, it was its enormous power,because it united different functionsin one organization.First of all, the Stasiwas an intelligence service.It used all the imaginable instrumentsfor getting information secretly,such as informers, or tapping phones,as you can see it on the picture here.And it was not only active in East Germany,but all over the world.Secondly, the Stasi was a secret police.It could stop people on the streetand arrest them in its own prisons.Thirdly, the Stasi workedas a kind of public prosecutor.It had the right to open preliminary investigationsand to interrogate people officially.Last but not least,the Stasi had its own armed forces.More than 11,000 soldiers were servingin its so-called Guards Regiment.It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings.Due to this concentration of power,the Stasi was called a state in the state.

zh-cn:但是我们来看更多史塔西的工具的细节请记住当时互联网和智能手机还未被发明当然，史塔西使用各种技术工具来调查人民电话被窃听包括西部德国总理和所在部门的电话每一天，9万封信被这些机械打开史塔西也跟踪成千上万的人使用特殊训练的特工和秘密相机来记录一个人走的每一步在这张照片里，你可以看见我还是一个年轻人的样子刚好在这个建筑前面就是现在我们在的地方，照片是史塔西代理照的史塔西甚至收集人们的体味它把样本保存在密封的罐子里在和平革命后被发现以上所有任务，由高度专业化部门负责窃听电话的任务和掌管信件任务部门完全分离有很好的理由因为如果一个代理离开史塔西它的知情度会非常少如和斯诺登相反（爱德华・斯诺登，泄露美国棱镜计划）但是纵向专业化同样很重要可用于防止产生任何对于观察对象的同情心跟踪我的对象并不知道我是谁和我为什么被调查事实上，我从前西德向前东德走私禁书
en:But let&#39;s look in more and more detailat the tools of the Stasi.Please keep in mind that at that timethe web and smartphones were not yet invented.Of course, the Stasi used all kindsof technical instruments to survey people.Telephones were wiretapped,including the phone of theGerman chancellor in the West,and often also the apartments.Every day, 90,000 letters were being openedby these machines.The Stasi also shadowedtens of thousands of peopleusing specially trained agents and secret camerasto document every step one took.In this picture, you can see meas a young man just in front of this buildingwhere we are now, photographed by a Stasi agent.The Stasi even collected the smell of people.It stored samples of it in closed jarswhich were found after the peaceful revolution.For all these tasks, highly specialized departmentswere responsible.The one which was tapping phone callswas completely separatedfrom the one which controlled the letters,for good reasons,because if one agent quit the Stasi,his knowledge was very small.Contrast that with Snowden, for example.But the vertical specialization was also importantto prevent all kinds of empathywith the object of observation.The agent who shadowed medidn&#39;t know who I wasor why I was surveyed.In fact, I smuggled forbidden booksfrom West to East Germany.

zh-cn:但是史塔西更典型的是使用人类智慧即向史塔西告密的人在国家安全部这些所谓非官方雇员是最重要的工具从1975年起，接近20万人和史塔西长期合作人数多于国家人口的百分之一在某种情况下，安全部是对的因为技术工具只能记录人们的活动但是特工和间谍同时能报告人们的计划和他们的思想因此，史塔西雇佣了大量告密者如它所言，获得他们和教育他们的体系是非常复杂的史塔西有自己的大学离这里不远他们在那里探索方法、教导工作者这本指引给出详细介绍关于你需要采取的每一步如果你想说服人类背叛他们的公民同胞有时，有人说 告密者是被迫成为其中一员的但这在大部分情况下并不真实因为被强迫的告密者是糟糕的告密者只有想给你提供必要信息的人才是一个有效的告密者人们和史塔西合作的重要原因是政治信仰和实际利益工作人员也尝试在他们和告密者间建立私人联系老实说，史塔西的例子显示要赢得某人背叛其他人并不太难甚至某些前东德的高层异议分子与史塔西有合作例如伊布拉西・博梅在1989年，他是和平革命领袖他几乎成为第一个自由选举产生的GDR首相但结果他是一位告密者
en:But what was even more typical for the Stasiwas the use of human intelligence,people who reported secretly to the Stasi.For the Minister of State Security,these so-called unofficial employeeswere the most important tools.From 1975 on, nearly 200,000 peoplecollaborated constantly with the Stasi,more than one percent of the population.And in a way, the minister was right,because technical instrumentscan only register what people are doing,but agents and spies can also reportwhat people are planning to doand what they are thinking.Therefore, the Stasi recruited so many informants.The system of how to get themand how to educate them, as it was called,was very sophisticated.The Stasi had its own university,not far away from here,where the methods were exploredand taught to the officers.This guideline gave a detailed descriptionof every step you have to takeif you want to convince human beingsto betray their fellow citizens.Sometimes it&#39;s said that informants were pressuredto becoming one,but that&#39;s mostly not true,because a forced informant is a bad informant.Only someone who wants to giveyou the information you needis an effective whistleblower.The main reasons why peoplecooperated with the Stasiwere political conviction and material benefits.The officers also tried to create a personal bondbetween themselves and the informant,and to be honest, the example of the Stasi showsthat it&#39;s not so difficult to win someonein order to betray others.Even some of the top dissidents in East Germanycollaborated with the Stasi,as for instance Ibrahim Böhme.In 1989, he was the leader of the peaceful revolutionand he nearly became the first freelyelected Prime Minister of the GDRuntil it came out that he was an informant.

zh-cn:间谍网络非常广泛几乎在任何机构甚至在教堂或者前西德都有大量间谍的存在我记得告诉过一个史塔西领导工作者「如果你向我派一位告密者我很肯定能认出他」他的回答是「我们没有派任何人我们使用的是那些在你身边的人」事实上，我的两个最好的朋友向史塔西举报了我告密者非常亲近，并不只发生在我的身上例如，另一个异议分子领袖，雷恩斯・菲尔德在她的案例中，她丈夫是暗中监视她的人一位著名作家被他的兄弟背叛这令我想起乔治・奧威尔写的小说「1984」小说里仅有的明显可以信任的人是一位告密者
en:The net of spies was really broad.In nearly every institution,even in the churches or in West Germany,there were many of them.I remember telling a leading Stasi officer,&quot;If you had sent an informant to me,I would surely have recognized him.&quot;His answer was,&quot;We didn&#39;t send anyone.We took those who were around you.&quot;And in fact, two of my best friendsreported about me to the Stasi.Not only in my case, informers were very close.For example, Vera Lengsfeld,another leading dissident,in her case it was her husband who spied on her.A famous writer was betrayed by his brother.This reminds me of the novel &quot;1984&quot; by George Orwell,where the only apparently trustable personwas an informer.

zh-cn:但是为什么史塔西收集所有这些信息到它的档案室里？主要目的是控制社会几乎每次演说，史塔西部长会下令弄清楚谁是谁即每个人在想什么他不想等到某人尝试反抗这个政权他想提前知道人民的思想和计划前东德人民当然知道他们被情报员包围因为在这个产生怀疑的集权主义政体和普遍恐惧感的国家里情报员是独裁主义里面压迫人民最重要的工具
en:But why did the Stasi collect all this informationin its archives?The main purpose was to control the society.In nearly every speech, the Stasi ministergave the order to find out who is who,which meant who thinks what.He didn&#39;t want to wait until somebodytried to act against the regime.He wanted to know in advancewhat people were thinking and planning.The East Germans knew, of course,that they were surrounded by informers,in a totalitarian regime that created mistrustand a state of widespread fear,the most important tools to oppress peoplein any dictatorship.

zh-cn:那就是为什么很多前东德人尝试与共产主义政权作斗争如果这样做，史塔西经常使用一种非常残忍的方法它被称为分解它被另一本指引所描述这个单词很难翻译因为它原意是「生物降解」但事实上，这是它很准确的描述目标是悄悄地毁灭人民的自信心例如毁坏他们的威望通过在他们工作中安排失败和破坏他们的个人关系的方式考虑到这一点，前东德是一个非常前卫的独裁国家史塔西没有尝试拘捕每一个异议分子它选择击垮他们它之所以能够这样做是因为它有大量个人资料和大量机构资料扣押某人只是最后的手段为此，史塔西拥有17个扣押监狱每个地区一个在这里，史塔西也发明了很先进的扣押方法通常，审问人员并不折磨犯人反而，他使用一种复杂的中心是绝对隔离的心理施压体系几乎没有囚犯能够忍耐下来不作供如果你有机会请参观在柏林的前史塔西监狱并且参加由前政治囚犯导游的游览这会解释让你知道这一切是如何运作的
en:That&#39;s why not many East Germans triedto fight against the Communist regime.If yes, the Stasi often used a methodwhich was really diabolic.It was called Zersetzung,and it&#39;s described in another guideline.The word is difficult to translate because it meansoriginally &quot;biodegradation.&quot;But actually, it&#39;s a quite accurate description.The goal was to destroy secretlythe self-confidence of people,for example by damaging their reputation,by organizing failures in their work,and by destroying their personal relationships.Considering this, East Germanywas a very modern dictatorship.The Stasi didn&#39;t try to arrest every dissident.It preferred to paralyze them,and it could do so becauseit had access to so much personal informationand to so many institutions.Detaining someone was used onlyas a last resort.For this, the Stasi owned 17 remand prisons,one in every district.Here, the Stasi also developedquite modern methods of detention.Normally, the interrogation officerdidn&#39;t torture the prisoner.Instead, he used a sophisticated systemof psychological pressurein which strict isolation was central.Nearly no prisoner resistedwithout giving a testimony.If you have the occasion,do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlinand attend a guided tourwith a former political prisonerwho will explain to you how this worked.
时间：13:38
zh-cn:还有一个问题需要被解答：如果史塔西组织得这么好为什么共产主义政体崩塌了？首先，在1989年，前东德领导权不知道怎么来应对不断增长的抗议民众它非常困惑因为社会主义的发源地苏维埃联盟发布了一个更自由的政策另外，这个政体依赖于从西部获得的贷款因此，史塔西没有收到粉碎暴动的指令其次，共产主义思想体系没有批判主义的位置相反地，领导权坚持了社会主义是一个完美体系的信仰当然，史塔西必须证实这个信念结果是尽管有所有信息这个政体仍不能分析自己的真实问题因而它不能解决它们最后，史塔西灭亡因为这些体系它被用来承担保护职责
en:One more question needs to be answered:If the Stasi were so well organized,why did the Communist regime collapse?First, in 1989, the leadership in East Germanywas uncertain what to do againstthe growing protest of people.It was especially confusedbecause in the mother country of socialism,the Soviet Union,a more liberal policy took place.In addition, the regime was dependenton the loans from the West.Therefore, no order to crash down the uprisingwas given to the Stasi.Secondly, in the Communist ideology,there&#39;s no place for criticism.Instead, the leadership stuck to the beliefthat socialism is a perfect system,and the Stasi had to confirm that, of course.The consequence wasthat despite all the information,the regime couldn&#39;t analyze its real problems,and therefore it couldn&#39;t solve them.In the end, the Stasi diedbecause of the structuresthat it was charged with protecting.

zh-cn:史塔西的结局是悲剧的因为这些工作人员在和平革命期间只忙于一件事：毁灭他们几十年来产生的所有文件幸运地他们被人权活动制止这就是我们今天能用这些文档更好了解一个监控国家如何运作的原因
en:The ending of the Stasiwas something tragic,because these officerswere kept busy during the peaceful revolutionwith only one thing:to destroy the documentsthey had produced during decades.Fortunately,they had been stopped by human rights activists.That&#39;s why today we can use the filesto get a better understandingof how a surveillance state functions.

en:Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you very much.So Hubertus, I want to ask you a couple of questionsbecause I have here Der Spiegel from last week.&quot;Mein Nachbar NSA.&quot; My neighbor, the NSA.And you just told us about my neighbor,the spies and the informant from East Germany.So there is a direct link between these two storiesor there isn&#39;t?What&#39;s your reaction as ahistorian when you see this?
时间：16:04
zh-cn:Hubertus Knabe：我觉得应提及多个方面首先，我觉得收集这些数据的原因不一样你做这件事的原因是保护你的人民远离恐怖袭击还是为了压迫你的人民？所以那会是一个本质上的区别但是另一方面在民主国家中，这些工具也能被滥用这也是我们需要意识到并制止的地方还有情报机构也要尊重我们已有的章程第三点，可能我们能生活在民主国家真的很幸福因为你能确定在俄罗斯和中国他们还在做同样的事但是没有人提及因为没有人能够那样做
en:Hubertus Knabe: I think there areseveral aspects to mention.At first, I think there&#39;s a differenceof why you are collecting this data.Are you doing that for protecting your peopleagainst terrorist attacks,or are you doing that for oppressing your people?So that makes a fundamental difference.But on the other hand,also in a democracy, theseinstruments can be abused,and that is something where we really haveto be aware to stop that,and that also the intelligence servicesare respecting the rules we have.The third point, probably,we really can be happy that we live in a democracy,because you can be sure that Russia and Chinaare doing the same,but nobody speaks about thatbecause nobody could do that.

zh-cn:BG：当时一个新闻报道首次出现去年七月你递交一份德国审理委员会刑事起诉书为什么？HK：是的，我这样做是因为我提到的第二点我觉得尤其在民主国家章程是对每个人而言的它们为每个人定立，所以它不允许任何机构不遵守这些章程在德国刑法里面，它写道没有法官的准许不能窃听任何人幸运地，它记载在德国刑法里面所以如果它不被遵守我觉得展开调查是必要的而且它需要很长时间让德国检察官开始调查并且他只开始于安格拉・默克尔的案件而不是所有其他生活在德国的人
en:BG: When the story came out first,last July, last year,you filed a criminal complaintwith a German tribunal. Why?HK: Yeah, I did so because ofthe second point I mentioned,that I think especially in a democracy,the rules are for everybody.They are made for everybody, so it&#39;s not allowedthat any institution doesn&#39;t respect the rules.In the criminal code of Germany, it&#39;s writtenthat it&#39;s not allowed to tap somebodywithout the permission of the judge.Fortunately, it&#39;s written inthe criminal code of Germany,so if it&#39;s not respected, then I thinkan investigation is necessary,and it took a very long time thatthe public prosecutor of Germany started this,and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel,and not in the case of all theother people living in Germany.

zh-cn:BG：那没有使我惊讶因为（掌声）因为你告诉我们的故事从外界来看，我住在德国以外的地方我期望德国马上给出更强有力的反应而相反地，这个反应仅出现当默克尔总理被揭露在被窃听时。为什么这样？
en:BG: That doesn&#39;t surprise me because —(Applause) —because of the story you told.Seen from the outside, I live outside of Germany,and I expected the Germans to reactmuch more strongly, immediately.And instead, the reaction really came onlywhen Chancellor Merkel was revealedas being wiretapped. Why so?

zh-cn:HK：我把这件事作为一个好的迹象因为人民在这个民主国家中感到安全他们并不害怕会被拘捕而且如果你在会议后离开这个大堂没有人会害怕秘密警察站在外面和拘捕你所以这是一个好的迹象，我觉得人民并没有像他们可能那样真的畏惧但是当然，我认为，相关机构要负责制止在德国或者在任何其他地方发生的不合法行为
en:HK: I take it as a good sign,because people feel secure in this democracy.They aren&#39;t afraid that they will be arrested,and if you leave this hall after the conference,nobody has to be afraid that the secret policeis standing out and is arresting you.So that&#39;s a good sign, I think.People are not really scared, as they could be.But of course, I think, the institutionsare responsible to stop illegal actionsin Germany or wherever they happen.

en:HK: Oh, that&#39;s a difficult question,but if you ask me,and if I answer honestly,I would give him the asylum,because I think it was really brave what he did,and he destroyed his whole lifeand his family and everything.So I think, for these people,we should do something,and especially if you see the German history,where so many people had to escapeand they asked for asylum in other countriesand they didn&#39;t get it,so it would be a good sign to give him asylum.
