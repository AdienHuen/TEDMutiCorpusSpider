zh-cn:我的成长经历充满惊奇从小就与动物相伴因为我在南非东部的荒野中长大在一个叫伦多洛兹(Londolozi)的保育区我们家在当地经营生态游猎已有四代之久就我记忆所及我的工作就是带人走进大自然所以我觉得今天因缘际会让我有机会把我在大自然中的经验在此分享非洲是一处人们可在星空下围坐篝火边讲故事的地方所以今天我要与各位分享的是几段简单的「围炉夜语」都与勇敢的好汉相关我要讲的故事不是新闻会播报的那种非洲确实是个艰困的地方但我也知道此处的人类、 动物和生态系统让我们见识了更紧密相连的脉络
en:I grew up in wonder.I grew up amongst those animals.I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africaat a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.It&#39;s a place where my family has beenin the safari business for four generations.Now for as long as I can remember,my job has been to take people out into nature,and so I think it&#39;s a lovely twist of fate todayto have the opportunityto bring some of my experiences out in naturein to this gathering.Africa is a placewhere people still sit under starlit skiesand around campfires and tell stories,and so what I have to share with you todayis the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,stories about heroes of heart.Now my stories are not the storiesthat you&#39;ll hear on the news,and while it&#39;s true that Africa is a harsh place,I also know it to be a placewhere people, animals and ecosystemsteach us about a more interconnected world.

zh-cn:我九岁的时候曼德拉总统来我家住那时他刚从27年的监禁中获释还无法完全适应自己突然变成全球注目的焦点非洲民族议会的议员以为在丛林中他会有休养生息的机会摆脱众人的眼光而狮群确能有效吓阻媒体和狗仔队（笑声）对年幼的我来说,当时的影响至关重大我会送早餐到他床边，之后穿着旧运动服和拖鞋他会在花园里散步晚上，我和家人则围坐在画面有杂纹的天线电视旁花园里那个沉默的身影就是我们在电视上看到那个被人海包围的人晚间播出的是他获释的镜头那时他正以非凡的仁心为动荡分歧的南非带来和平曼德拉常说，坐牢的好处就是有办法内省、思考并在心中擘划他最想为南非做的事情：和平、 和解、 和谐透过这种极为宽厚的胸怀他后来注定要成为南非当地所谓「ubuntu」的象征意思是「是你造就了我!」也可以说，若没有彼此人无法成就自己这不是新的概念或价值观却是我最近认为值得加以阐扬的理念事实上有此一说，非洲人都相信透过与他人的互动我们得以体认自己最深切的人性我们现场就体现了Ubuntu你们创造了这个场合让我得以表达最真切的自己没有各位，我不过是空房独语尽管上礼拜我常这样做但表现差多了!（笑声）
en:When I was nine years old,President Mandela came to stay with my family.He had just been released fromhis 27 years of incarceration,and was in a period of readjustmentto his sudden global icon status.Members of the African National Congressthought that in the bushhe would have time to rest and recuperateaway from the public eye,and it&#39;s true that lions tend to bea very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.(Laughter)But it was a defining time for me as a young boy.I would take him breakfast in bed,and then, in an old track suit and slippers,he would go for a walk around the garden.At night, I would sit with my familyaround the snowy, bunny-eared TV,and watch images of that samequiet man from the gardensurrounded by hundreds and thousands of peopleas scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.He was bringing peaceto a divided and violent South Africa,one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.Mandela said often that the gift of prisonwas the ability to go within and to think,to create in himselfthe things he most wanted for South Africa:peace, reconciliation, harmony.Through this act of immense open-heartedness,he was to become the embodimentof what in South Africa we call &quot;ubuntu.&quot;Ubuntu: I am because of you.Or, people are not peoplewithout other people.It&#39;s not a new idea or valuebut it&#39;s one that I certainly think at these timesis worth building on.In fact, it is said that in thecollective consciousness of Africa,we get to experience the deepest partsof our own humanitythrough our interactions with others.Ubuntu is at play right now.You are holding a space for meto express the deepest truth of who I am.Without you, I&#39;m just a guy talking to an empty room,and I spent a lot of time last week doing that,and it&#39;s not the same as this.(Laughter)

zh-cn:若国内和国际性的Ubuntu代表是曼德拉那关于这种价值教我最多的是这个人萨利 穆朗戈 (Solly Mhlongo)萨利是在树下出生的离我长大的莫桑比克的60 公里远他向来不怎么富裕但我遇过最富足的人当中他是其中一位萨利从小就为父亲照顾牛只我无法体会自小放牧的生活但这种成长环境造就顶尖的本领他在游猎这行的首份工作是修理游猎车(safari trucks)至于在丛林长大的他怎么会这个我无从得知，但他确实能修理后来他转行到我们所谓的栖地团队也就是维持保护区完善的一群人他修整道路，复育湿地也参与防堵盗猎有天我们一起出去他看到一只雌豹留下的旧足迹为了好玩，他转身追踪我告诉你，从他循迹追踪的速度我看得出来这家伙是博士级的追踪者如果你在保护区开车与萨利擦身而过抬头看一下后照镜就会发现他往前开20或50米就会停在路边看看你有无不时之需我所听过，针对他的唯一指控就是我们的一位游客说:「萨利，你乐于助人的毛病就是改不了!」（笑声）
en:If Mandela was the nationaland international embodiment,then the man who taught me the mostabout this value personally was this man,Solly Mhlongo.Solly was born under a tree60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.He would never have a lot of money,but he was to beone of the richest men I would ever meet.Solly grew up tending to his father&#39;s cattle.Now, I can tell you, I don&#39;t know what it isabout people who grow up looking after cattle,but it makes for über-resourcefulness.The first job that he ever got in the safari businesswas fixing the safari trucks.Where he had learned to do that out in the bushI have no idea, but he could do it.He then moved across into what we calledthe habitat team.These were the people on the reservewho were responsible for its well-being.He fixed roads, he mended wetlands,he did some anti-poaching.And then one day we were out together,and he came across the tracks of wherea female leopard had walked.And it was an old track,but for fun he turned and he began to follow it,and I tell you, I could tell by the speedat which he moved on those pad marksthat this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.If you drove past Sollysomewhere out on the reserve,you look up in your rearview mirror,you&#39;d see he&#39;d stopped the car20, 50 meters down the roadjust in case you need help with something.The only accusation I ever heard leveled at himwas when one of our clients said,&quot;Solly, you are pathologically helpful.&quot;(Laughter)

zh-cn:当我成为专业的本地导览员时萨利是我的追踪者我俩团队合作我们的第一批客人是美东来的一个慈善团体他们悄悄对萨利说：「在我们出去看狮子和猎豹前，我们想先看看你住的地方。」所以我们就带他们去他们到萨利家拜访时，正好萨利的妻子在家学英语她正处于练习开门问候语的阶段:「你好，我爱你。欢迎，我爱你。」（笑声）在我看来，非洲的美在于住家虽小但主人慷慨大气
en:When I started professionally guiding peopleout into this environment,Solly was my tracker.We worked together as a team.And the first guests we ever gotwere a philanthropy group from your East Coast,and they said to Solly, on the side, they said,&quot;Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,we want to see where you live.&quot;So we took them up to his house,and this visit of the philanthropist to his housecoincided with a time when Solly&#39;s wife,who was learning English,was going through a phasewhere she would open the doorby saying, &quot;Hello, I love you.Welcome, I love you.&quot; (Laughter)And there was something so beautifully Africanabout it to me, this small housewith a huge heart in it.

zh-cn:话说从救我的那天后我就把萨利当英雄那天很热我们在一条河边由于太热，我脱掉鞋子卷起裤管走入水中萨利仍待在岸边清澈的河水流过沙滩我们转身溯河而上在前方几米处岸边有棵树倒落河滨枝干已没入水面形成一片阴影若是恐怖片观众里会冒出这样的话：「别去！不要啊!」（笑声）果然，暗处有鳄鱼藏身被鳄鱼袭击的话，首先感到的是牠凶残的撕咬一声巨响! 我感觉右腿被咬了牠甩头拉扯，我一手攀住树干这时鳄鱼也剧烈地摇晃我，另一种生物想要吃你时那感觉难以言喻若要提倡素食，很少有比这效果更好的!（笑声）岸上的萨利见我身陷险境急忙转身赶来救我这时鳄鱼再度摆头摇晃并咬我我发现河面一抹血迹顺流而下鳄鱼再度咬我时，我踢了一下一脚深入鳄鱼喉咙，牠才松口我攀上树枝离开水面后，我回头一看我被咬的那脚，膝盖以下伤势惨不忍睹除了骨折肌肉组织也遭撕裂我当机立断不要再看我离开水面时萨利也来到我们之间水位较深的地方他明白是怎么回事，包括我的腿伤也知道我们之间有一条鳄鱼说来你也许不信，他毫不迟疑就直接进入深水区他涉水而来时，水位过腰接着到我身边抓住我当时我仍在鳄鱼的攻击范围内抱起我后，他把我背在肩上萨利的另一项特质就是极其强壮他转身带我上岸放下我后，他脱下衬衫来包扎我的伤腿然后再把我抱起走到车上并送我就医我才大难不死
en:Now on the day that Solly saved my life,he was already my hero.It was a hot day,and we found ourselves down by the river.Because of the heat, I took my shoes off,and I rolled up my pants,and I walked into the water.Solly remained on the bank.The water was clear running over sand,and we turned and we beganto make our way upstream.And a few meters ahead of us,there was a place where a treehad fallen out of the bank,and its branches were touching the water,and it was shadowy.And if had been a horror movie,people in the audience would have started saying,&quot;Don&#39;t go in there. Don&#39;t go in there.&quot; (Laughter)And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.Now the first thing that you noticewhen a crocodile hits youis the ferocity of the bite.Wham! It hits me by my right leg.It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up.I&#39;m able to grab a branch.It&#39;s shaking me violently.It&#39;s a very strange sensationhaving another creature try and eat you,and there are few things thatpromote vegetarianism like that.(Laughter)Solly on the bank sees that I&#39;m in trouble.He turns. He begins to make his way to me.The croc again continues to shake me.It goes to bite me a second time.I notice a slick of blood in the water around methat gets washed downstream.As it bites the second time, I kick.My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.I pull myself up into the branches,and as I come out of the water,I look over my shoulder.My leg from the knee downis mangled beyond description.The bone is cracked.The meat is torn up.I make an instant decision thatI&#39;ll never look at that again.As I come out of the water,Solly arrives at a deep section,a channel between us.He knows, he sees the state of my leg,he knows that between him and Ithere is a crocodile,and I can tell you this man doesn&#39;tslow down for one second.He comes straight into the channel.He wades in to above his waist.He gets to me. He grabs me.I&#39;m still in a vulnerable position.He picks me and puts me on his shoulder.This is the other thing about Solly,he&#39;s freakishly strong.He turns. He walks me up the bank.He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.He wraps it around my leg,picks me up a second time,walks me to a vehicle,and he&#39;s able to get me to medical attention.And I survive.

zh-cn:我不知各位认识的人当中有多少即使知道水中有鳄鱼仍愿冒险犯难去帮你一把但对萨利来说，这是稀松平常的道理他是我在非洲的经历中一个令人惊异的榜样在群体关系更紧密的社会中人们打从心底明白彼此的幸福是密切相关的危险与痛苦一起承担喜悦和成就也要共享住所和食物也不例外Ubuntu 就是要人敞开心房与人分享那天我从萨利身上学到的正是Ubuntu的本质他行动间总是活力充沛且善体人意
en:Now I don&#39;t know how many people you knowthat go into a deep channel of waterthat they know has a crocodile in itto come and help you,but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.And he is one amazing exampleof what I have experienced all over Africa.In a more collective society,we realize from the insidethat our own well-being is deeply tiedto the well-being of others.Danger is shared. Pain is shared.Joy is shared. Achievement is shared.Houses are shared. Food is shared.Ubuntu asks us to open our heartsand to share,and what Solly taught me that dayis the essence of this value,his animated, empathetic actionin every moment.

zh-cn:虽然ubuntu的字根舆人有关我也曾以为这是唯一的解释直到我遇见这头名叫猫王(Elvis)的母象事实上，萨利给她取这名字据他说是因为她的步伐就像猫王的扭臀舞她的后腿和骨盆先天严重变形是从我们这个保护区的东边另一个在她迁徙路径上的保护区来的我第一次看到这头母象一度认为她来日无多然而，往后的五年她都会在冬季回来那时我们会因为在野外发现她与众不同的足迹而兴奋不已那足迹像是反向的括号这时我们定会放下手边的事前往她和所属象群所在的地方游猎车上的人看到「猫王」时都洋溢着感情就是这种亲切感提醒了我一件事即使是在城市长大的人对自然界及其中的生物仍会本能地感到亲切直到那时我仍很讶异她能活下来有天我们在这小水塘边遇到该象群那水塘陷入地表为首的母象喝水时，我在旁看着然后她以大象优雅缓慢的动作转身摆动的象鼻宛如挥舞的手臂只见她奋力爬上陡峭的边坡其他成员也转身跟进我注视着年纪尙轻的「猫王」开始为爬坡作好准备她双耳明显前翻奋力一试，爬至半途腿力不济，又滑了下来。于是她再试一次但也是无功而返就在她第三度尝试时不可思议的事发生了就在她爬到半途时一只年轻的大象来到她身后用象鼻托住她然后把她送上岸我还想到一件事就是其他象群成员其实也在照顾「猫王」隔天我又观察到带头的母象折了一根树枝放进嘴里后会再折一枝扔在地上我们那里的向导一致认为象群为顾及这头小母象实际上减缓了行进速度
en:Now although the root word is about people,I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.And then I met this young lady.Her name was Elvis.In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvisbecause he said she walked like she was doingthe Elvis the pelvis dance.She was born with very badlydeformed back legs and pelvis.She arrived at our reserve from a reserveeast of us on her migratory route.When I first saw her,I thought she would be dead in a matter of days.And yet, for the next five yearsshe returned in the winter months.And we would be so excited to be out in the bushand to come across this unusual track.It looked like an inverted bracket,and we would drop whateverwe were doing and we would follow,and then we would come around the corner,and there she would be with her herd.And that outpouring of emotionfrom people on our safari trucksas they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.And it reminded methat even people who grow up in citiesfeel a natural connectionwith the natural world and with animals.And yet still I remained amazedthat she was surviving.And then one day we came acrossthem at this small water hole.It was sort of a hollow in the ground.And I watched as the matriarch drank,and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants,looks like the arm in motion,and she began to make her way up the steep bank.The rest of the herd turned and began to follow.And I watched young Elvisbegin to psych herself up for the hill.She got visibly — ears came forward,she had a full go of it and halfway up,her legs gave way, and she fell backwards.She attempted it a second time,and again, halfway up, she fell backwards.And on the third attempt,an amazing thing happened.Halfway up the bank,a young teenage elephant came in behind her,and he propped his trunk underneath her,and he began to shovel her up the bank.And it occurred to methat the rest of the herdwas in fact looking after this young elephant.The next day I watched againas the matriarch broke a branchand she would put it in her mouth,and then she would break a second oneand drop it on the ground.And a consensus developed between all of uswho were guiding people in that areathat that herd was in fact moving slowerto accommodate that elephant.

zh-cn:我从牠们身上得到的领悟让我对ubuntu有更广泛的定义我相信在神圣的荒野中我们会有机会看见自己最良善的特质透过他人我们可体认自身的人性但所有地球生物也能让我们有此体悟如果非洲有值得分享的地方那就是更紧密共荣的社会Ubuntu 确实是非洲的价值观但我目睹这个价值的精髓在此形成
en:What Elvis and the herd taught mecaused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselvesreflected back at us.And it is not only through other peoplethat we get to experience our humanitybut through all the creatures that live on this planet.If Africa has a gift to share,it&#39;s a gift of a more collective society.And while it&#39;s true that ubuntu is an African idea,what I see is the essence of that valuebeing invented here.

en:He was the father of our nationand we&#39;ve got a road to walk in South Africa.And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.You know, he used to go toa rugby match and we would win.Anywhere he went, things went well.But I think that magic will be with us,and the important thing is that we carrywhat he stood for.And so that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to try and do,and that&#39;s what people all over South Africa are trying to do.
