zh-cn:我想探讨慈悲心这个话题慈悲心有很多形态有些是激烈的；有些是忿怒的有些是温和的, 有些是智慧的达赖喇嘛曾说过他说：“爱与慈悲是必需品它们不是奢侈品没有它们人性无法留存。”我想说的是不仅人性难以保全我们今天所知道的地球上所有的物种都是不论是大型猫科动物还是浮游生物
en:I want to address the issue of compassion.Compassion has many faces.Some of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful;some of them are tender; some of them are wise.A line that the Dalai Lama once said,he said, &quot;Love and compassion are necessities.They are not luxuries.Without them,humanity cannot survive.&quot;And I would suggest,it is not only humanity that won&#39;t survive,but it is all species on the planet,as we&#39;ve heard today.It is the big cats,and it&#39;s the plankton.

zh-cn:两周前，我在印度的班加罗尔我很荣幸的在班加罗尔的郊区一个安养院教授临终关怀每天很早我就去病房在那家安养院有31个人处在濒死状态我走到一个老年妇女的床前她的呼吸非常急促而微弱很明显她处于濒死的末期我看着她的脸看着坐在她旁边她儿子的脸他的脸溢满了悲伤和困惑
en:Two weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.I was so privilegedto be able to teach in a hospiceon the outskirts of Bangalore.And early in the morning,I went into the ward.In that hospice,there were 31 men and womenwho were actively dying.And I walked up to the bedsideof an old womanwho was breathing very rapidly, fragile,obviously in the latter phaseof active dying.I looked into her face.I looked into the faceof her son sitting next to her,and his face was just rivenwith grief and confusion.

zh-cn:我记得摩诃婆罗多伟大的印度史诗里有这么一段话：“尤帝士提尔，什么是这世上最美妙的事情？”尤帝士提尔答道“世上最美妙的事情就是我们所有人都将死去而我们对此却一无所知。”我仰起头照顾这31个濒死者的是来自班加罗尔周边村子的年轻女性我看着她们的脸在她们的脸上我看到慈悲显现时升起的力量我看着她的手她在给一个老年男人沐浴
en:And I remembereda line from the Mahabharata,the great Indian epic:&quot;What is the most wondrous thing in the world, Yudhisthira?&quot;And Yudhisthira replied,&quot;The most wondrous thing in the worldis that all around uspeople can be dyingand we don&#39;t realizeit can happen to us.&quot;I looked up.Tending those 31 dying peoplewere young womenfrom villages around Bangalore.I looked into the face of one of these women,and I saw in her facethe strength that ariseswhen natural compassion is really present.I watched her handsas she bathed an old man.

zh-cn:我转头望向另一个年轻女子她在擦拭另一位临死的人的脸这让我想起我刚刚演讲提到的那些内容差不多每一年我由此荣幸身负使命进入喜马拉雅地区和西藏高原我们在每一个遥远的区域开设诊所那里没有医疗护理此类
en:My gaze went to another young womanas she wiped the faceof another dying person.And it reminded meof something that I had just been present for.Every year or so,I have the privilege of taking cliniciansinto the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.And we run clinicsin these very remote regionswhere there&#39;s no medical care whatsoever.

zh-cn:我们在胡姆拉的Simikot的头一天在尼泊尔的最西端全国最贫困的地区一个抱着一堆破烂布片的老人走进来他进了门，有人招呼他然后我们发现他是耳聋我们看看那堆布片里头露出一双眼睛来打开裹着的布片是一个重度烧伤的女孩再一次观世音的眼睛和慈悲之手显现也就是那些年轻女性，援助者清理孩子的伤口并包扎上
en:And on the first day at Simikot in Humla,far west of Nepal,the most impoverished region of Nepal,an old man came inclutching a bundle of rags.And he walked in, and somebody said something to him,we realized he was deaf,and we looked into the rags,and there was this pair of eyes.The rags were unwrappedfrom a little girlwhose body was massively burned.Again,the eyes and handsof Avalokiteshvara.It was the young women, the health aids,who cleaned the wounds of this babyand dressed the wounds.

zh-cn:我认识那些手和眼睛它们也曾经抚慰过我它们在过去抚慰过我在我68年生命中抚慰了我在我四岁失去视力几乎瘫痪的时候它们抚慰了我我的家人带来一个女人，她的母亲曾经是个奴隶她照顾我这个女人并没有感性的慈悲心她有的是非凡的力量我相信,是她的力量成为一种启发与指引是我生命中的指明灯
en:I know those hands and eyes;they touched me as well.They touched me at that time.They have touched me throughout my 68 years.They touched me when I was fourand I lost my eyesightand was partially paralyzed.And my family brought ina woman whose mother had been a slaveto take care of me.And that womandid not have sentimental compassion.She had phenomenal strength.And it was really her strength, I believe,that became the kind of mudra and imprimaturthat has been a guiding light in my life.

zh-cn:我们问道：慈悲是什么构成的？答案包含很多方面有指代性的和非指代性的但首先，慈悲是透彻观照苦难之存在的能力构成这种能力让我们保持坚强并让我们意识到我是这苦难的一部分但这不够因为慈悲心激发运动皮质层也就是说我们受到激励被激励着去化解苦难如果我们足够幸运的话我们从事的活动能化解苦难但慈悲心有另一个组成部分这个部分非常重要这就是我们不应该耽于结果
en:So we can ask:What is compassion comprised of?And there are various facets.And there&#39;s referential and non-referential compassion.But first, compassion is comprisedof that capacityto see clearlyinto the nature of suffering.It is that abilityto really stand strongand to recognize alsothat I&#39;m not separate from this suffering.But that is not enough,because compassion,which activates the motor cortex,means that we aspire,we actually aspire to transform suffering.And if we&#39;re so blessed,we engage in activitiesthat transform suffering.But compassion has another component,and that component is really essential.That componentis that we cannot be attached to outcome.

zh-cn:如今，我已为临死的人们工作了40余年我曾有幸 在最大限度安全保证下为死刑犯工作了六个年头我清楚的认识到在我的个人生活经历中为临死之人工作以及培训护理者的个人生活中任何耽于结果的感情只会深深影响我自己的面对大苦难的能力
en:Now I worked with dying peoplefor over 40 years.I had the privilege of working on death rowin a maximum security [prison] for six years.And I realized so clearlyin bringing my own life experience,from working with dying peopleand training caregivers,that any attachment to outcomewould distort deeplymy own capacity to be fully presentto the whole catastrophe.

zh-cn:在我为监狱系统工作时我很清楚：这个屋子里很多人还有几乎所有与我一起为死刑犯共事过的人他们的慈悲之火种从未被扑灭这种慈悲是人类内在的特质存在于每个人之中但慈悲被触发被鼓励的条件都是特殊情况某种程度上，我是深深受幼时疾患的影响伊娃･恩斯勒，一会儿她会演讲她是受她经历过的汪洋般的苦难所激发的
en:And when I worked in the prison system,it was so clear to me, this:that many of usin this room,and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row,the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered.That compassion is actuallyan inherent human quality.It is there within every human being.But the conditionsfor compassion to be activated,to be aroused,are particular conditions.I had that condition, to a certain extent,from my own childhood illness.Eve Ensler, whom you&#39;ll hear later,has had that condition activatedamazingly in herthrough the various waters of sufferingthat she has been through.

zh-cn:神奇的是慈悲是有敌人的那些敌人是怜悯道德公愤恐惧你知道，我们的社会，这个世界已经在恐惧中麻痹当然在这麻痹之中我们的慈悲心也受到麻痹恐怖是全球性的这种恐怖感是全球性的某种程度上我们的工作是要阐明这种意象这种原型这已经毒害了整个世界的心灵
en:And what is fascinatingis that compassion has enemies,and those enemies are things like pity,moral outrage,fear.And you know, we have a society, a world,that is paralyzed by fear.And in that paralysis, of course,our capacity for compassionis also paralyzed.The very word terroris global.The very feeling of terror is global.So our work, in a certain way,is to address this imago,this kind of archetypethat has pervaded the psycheof our entire globe.

zh-cn:我们从神经科学得知慈悲有些非凡的特性比如：一个人正在修习慈悲当他们身处苦难存在之处他们觉得比别人受难更多然而他们能很快恢复常态这是弹性很多人认为慈悲会让自己枯竭但我保证它是真正启发我们的东西
en:Now we know from neurosciencethat compassion hassome very extraordinary qualities.For example:A person who is cultivating compassion,when they are in the presence of suffering,they feel that suffering a lot morethan many other people do.However,they return to baseline a lot sooner.This is called resilience.Many of us think that compassion drains us,but I promise youit is something that truly enlivens us.

zh-cn:另一个特性是它可以增强神经整合它使脑部的每个部分都联接起来另外，埃默里和戴维斯和其他一些研究者发现了慈悲会增强免疫力嗨我们生活在充满毒素的世界（笑声）我们很多人经历这个世界上的心理社会性的或肉体上的毒害于是渐渐凋零但慈悲，慈悲的产物却可以促进免疫能力
en:Another thing about compassionis that it really enhances what&#39;s called neural integration.It hooks up all parts of the brain.Another, which has been discoveredby various researchersat Emory and at Davis and so on,is that compassion enhances our immune system.Hey,we live in a very noxious world.(Laughter)Most of us are shrinkingin the face of psycho-social and physical poisons,of the toxins of our world.But compassion, the generation of compassion,actually mobilizesour immunity.

zh-cn:如你所知，如果慈悲是有益的我有个问题为什么我们不以慈悲教育我们的后代？（鼓掌）如果慈悲有益为什么我们不以慈悲培训保健服务的提供者这样他们各尽其职去真正化解痛苦？如果慈悲有益为什么我们不为慈悲投上一票？为什么我们不投票给政府里以慈悲为政的人这样我们可以有一个更关爱的世界佛教里我们说“强健于背而怀柔于胸”强大的力量才能在各种状况下支撑你这是精神上的禅定
en:You know, if compassion is so good for us,I have a question.Why don&#39;t we train our childrenin compassion?(Applause)If compassion is so good for us,why don&#39;t we train our health care providers in compassionso that they can do what they&#39;re supposed to do,which is to really transform suffering?And if compassion is so good for us,why don&#39;t we vote on compassion?Why don&#39;t we vote for people in our governmentbased on compassion,so that we can havea more caring world?In Buddhism,we say, &quot;it takes a strong back and a soft front.&quot;It takes tremendous strength of the backto uphold yourself in the midst of conditions.And that is the mental quality of equanimity.

zh-cn:但你也需要有个温柔的心以如实地接受和拥抱这个世界不去设防这在佛教中的原型就是千手观音这是个女性原型她感知整个世界苦难的哭喊她有一万个手臂每个手上都持有一件法器每个手掌上都是眼睛它们都是慧眼我说，在上千年的时间长河里女性与观音有着密切的关系她们是在世的观音是观音的具现观音感知世上苦难的哭喊
en:But it also takes a soft front —the capacity to really be open to the world as it is,to have an undefended heart.And the archetype of this in Buddhismis Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin.It&#39;s a female archetype:she who perceivesthe cries of suffering in the world.She stands with 10,000 arms,and in every hand,there is an instrument of liberation,and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes,and these are the eyes of wisdom.I say that, for thousands of years,women have lived,exemplified, met in intimacy,the archetype of Avalokitesvara,of Kuan-Yin,she who perceivesthe cries of suffering in the world.

zh-cn:女性已经在数千年里体现这种来自慈悲的力量并且是一种自然直接的方式去如实地感知苦难她们让世界充满善我们也确实在这一天半的时间里通过演讲过的每一个女性感受到了这一点她们通过直接行动具化了慈悲茱蒂·威廉斯说：冥思有益不好意思，你是不是该这么做做了，茱蒂等等，让我喘口气再说
en:Women have manifested for thousands of yearsthe strength arising from compassionin an unfiltered, unmediated wayin perceiving sufferingas it is.They have infused societies with kindness,and we have really felt thatas woman after womanhas stood on this stagein the past day and a half.And they have actualized compassionthrough direct action.Jody Williams called it:It&#39;s good to meditate.I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;ve got to do a little bit of that, Jody.Step back, give your mother a break, okay.

zh-cn:但是公式的另一半是你必须走出自己的洞穴融入这个世界如同无著（印度古代高僧）它跟着弥勒菩萨修行在洞穴里坐了12年他说“我得走出这里”他走到小路上看见了路上有什么他定睛一看，是条狗，他跪了下来看见狗的腿上有个大伤口里头化脓生蛆他用舌头弄出蛆以免伤害到它们那一刻狗幻化成爱与善的佛
en:But the other side of the equationis you&#39;ve got to come out of your cave.You have to come into the worldlike Asanga did,who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddhaafter 12 years sitting in the cave.He said, &quot;I&#39;m out of here.&quot;He&#39;s going down the path.He sees something in the path.He looks, it&#39;s a dog, he drops to his knees.He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.The wound is just filled with maggots.He puts out his tonguein order to remove the maggots,so as not to harm them.And at that moment,the dog transformedinto the Buddha of love and kindness.

en:I believethat women and girls todayhave to partner in a powerful way with men —with their fathers,with their sons, with their brothers,with the plumbers, the road builders,the caregivers, the doctors, the lawyers,with our president,and with all beings.The women in this roomare lotuses in a sea of fire.May we actualize that capacityfor women everywhere.
