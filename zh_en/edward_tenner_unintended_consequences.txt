zh-cn:我不总是喜欢无意识的后果但是我真正的学会了去欣赏它们我了解到它们是推动我们进步的本质即便在它们看起来不招人喜欢的时候我想回顾一下无意识后果是如何起做到作用的
en:I didn&#39;t always love unintended consequences,but I&#39;ve really learned to appreciate them.I&#39;ve learned that they&#39;re really the essenceof what makes for progress,even when they seem to be terrible.And I&#39;d like to reviewjust how unintended consequencesplay the part that they do.

zh-cn:让我们追溯到距今40,000年前文化大爆炸时期回到当音乐，艺术，科技这类我们今天享用着的众多事物我们在TED展示着的众多事物诞生之时人类学家 兰德尔·怀特有一个非常有趣的评论如果我们的祖先在40,000年前就可以看到他们做了什么他们不会真正理解他们只会对应对眼前之急他们为我们创造了继承发扬的可能性可是，他们其实并不知道是如何做的
en:Let&#39;s go to 40,000 years before the present,to the time of the cultural explosion,when music, art, technology,so many of the things that we&#39;re enjoying today,so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TEDwere born.And the anthropologist Randall Whitehas made a very interesting observation:that if our ancestors40,000 years agohad been able to seewhat they had done,they wouldn&#39;t have really understood it.They were respondingto immediate concerns.They were making it possible for usto do what they do,and yet, they didn&#39;t really understandhow they did it.

zh-cn:现在让我们回到距今10,000年前这是变得有趣的时期庄稼的规模种植？农业的起源？一万年前如果我们的祖先们有技术评估的能力他们会怎么说？我可以想象委员会会向他们汇报农业将把人类引向何处至少在未来的几百年期间那可是个坏消息首先，更糟的营养也许更短的生命农业规模化对于女性来说非常糟糕存留下来的当时人类骨骼显示他们当时日以继夜的碾磨谷物从政治上看，这是糟糕的这是更严重的人与人之间不平等的开始如果那时有一种理性的技术进行评估我想他们很可能会说“这事儿还是算了吧”
en:Now let&#39;s advance to 10,000 years before the present.And this is when it really gets interesting.What about the domestication of grains?What about the origins of agriculture?What would our ancestors 10,000 years agohave saidif they really had technology assessment?And I could just imagine the committeesreporting back to themon where agriculture was going to take humanity,at least in the next few hundred years.It was really bad news.First of all, worse nutrition,maybe shorter life spans.It was simply awful for women.The skeletal remains from that periodhave shown that they were grinding grain morning, noon and night.And politically, it was awful.It was the beginning of a much higher degreeof inequality among people.If there had been rational technology assessment then,I think they very well might have said,&quot;Let&#39;s call the whole thing off.&quot;

zh-cn:即便现在，我们的选择都存在着无意识的效果从历史角度看，举个例子筷子—根据一位密西根大学发表过相关论文的日本人类学家的观点—筷子导致了日本公众的齿系，牙齿发生了长期的变化我们现在也在改变着我们的牙齿有个证据显示人类的嘴和牙齿正在不断的变小这未必就是不好的无意识后果但是我认为站在尼安德特人的角度对我们不成大器的牙齿也许会有很多异议因此这些事情是相对的是基于你或你的祖先当时所处的位置所决定的
en:Even now, our choices are having unintended effects.Historically, for example,chopsticks — according to one Japanese anthropologistwho wrote a dissertation about itat the University of Michigan —resulted in long-term changesin the dentition, in the teeth,of the Japanese public.And we are also changing our teeth right now.There is evidencethat the human mouth and teethare growing smaller all the time.That&#39;s not necessarily a bad unintended consequence.But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal,there would have been a lot of disapprovalof the wimpish choppers that we now have.So these things are kind of relativeto where you or your ancestors happen to stand.

zh-cn:在远古世界对无意识后果抱有很强的尊重感并且有一种非常健康的谨慎感体现在智慧树上体现潘多拉盒上特别体现在普罗米修斯神话中在近代关于科学的比喻中是非常重要的那都是非常真实的古代的医生们—特别是那些我们所了解的开始研究医学的埃及医生—对于什么病能医治什么病不能治头脑是非常清醒的保留下来的文字资料上写着“这我不能治，这个我不会治”他们都非常明了因此他们都是希波克拉底的追随者希波克拉底的手稿同样—根据最近的研究，反复的—说明不造成伤害是多么重要最近哈维·库欣他对神经外科起到了重大的推动作用他把神经外科从一个会因为手术导致很多人死亡的医学领域改变成为了一个拥有着光明希望前景的领域他非常清楚他不可能永远是正确的但是他尽了全力并且总是一丝不苟正是这些使他改变了这个医学分支
en:In the ancient worldthere was a lot of respect for unintended consequences,and there was a very healthy sense of caution,reflected in the Tree of Knowledge,in Pandora&#39;s Box,and especially in the myth of Prometheusthat&#39;s been so importantin recent metaphors about technology.And that&#39;s all very true.The physicians of the ancient world —especially the Egyptians,who started medicine as we know it —were very consciousof what they could and couldn&#39;t treat.And the translations of the surviving texts say,&quot;This I will not treat. This I cannot treat.&quot;They were very conscious.So were the followers of Hippocrates.The Hippocratic manuscripts also —repeatedly, according to recent studies —show how important it is not to do harm.More recently,Harvey Cushing,who really developed neurosurgery as we know it,who changed it from a field of medicinethat had a majority of deaths resulting from surgeryto one in which there was a hopeful outlook,he was very consciousthat he was not always going to do the right thing.But he did his best,and he kept meticulous recordsthat let him transform that branch of medicine.

zh-cn:现在如果我们在向前看一下来到19世纪我们会发现科技的新类型那就是不再是单一工具而是系统我们发现越来越多机器复杂的结构从而越来越难去判断发生了什么首先体会到这些的人是19世纪中期的电报员他们是黑客的鼻祖托马斯·爱迪生如果生活在当今软件公司的氛围中将会非常非常舒服这些黑客们有一个词形容那些很离奇的电报系统错误他们称其为 “bugs”那就是现在说的“故障”这个词的原型这个有意识的命名于是就慢慢地传到了民间特别是消息灵通人士那里
en:Now if we look forward a bitto the 19th century,we find a new style of technology.What we find is,no longer simple tools,but systems.We find more and morecomplex arrangements of machinesthat make it harder and harderto diagnose what&#39;s going on.And the first people who saw thatwere the telegraphers of the mid-19th century,who were the original hackers.Thomas Edison would have been very, very comfortablein the atmosphere of a software firm today.And these hackers had a wordfor those mysterious bugs in telegraph systemsthat they called bugs.That was the origin of the word &quot;bug.&quot;This consciousness, though,was a little slow to seep through the general population,even people who were very, very well informed.

zh-cn:萨缪尔·克莱门斯，马克·吐温是个大发明家发明了最复杂的机器—至少在1918年前是的—在美国专利局注册那就是佩奇排字机佩奇排字机有一万八千个部件专利有64页文字和271张图表那是如此棒的一台机器因为它可以胜任排字员的所有工作—包括排字机归位这是非常困难的事对排版了如指掌的马克·吐温却因为这台机器受到沉重打击不幸的是，他受的打击还不止于此他因此破产了不得不靠世界巡回演讲偿还负债这件事对于19世纪的科技意义重大组件之间的相互联系有可能使得最好的点子付之东流即使它得到了顶级专家的认可
en:Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain,was a big investorin the most complex machine of all times —at least until 1918 —registered with the U.S. Patent Office.That was the Paige typesetter.The Paige typesetterhad 18,000 parts.The patent had 64 pages of textand 271 figures.It was such a beautiful machinebecause it did everything that a human being didin setting type —including returning the type to its place,which was a very difficult thing.And Mark Twain, who knew all about typesetting,really was smitten by this machine.Unfortunately, he was smitten in more ways than one,because it made him bankrupt,and he had to tour the world speakingto recoup his money.And this was an important thingabout 19th century technology,that all these relationships among partscould make the most brilliant idea fall apart,even when judged by the most expert people.

zh-cn:20世纪早期，还有一些事件使得情况变得更加复杂那就是安全技术本身就可能成为危险源对于很多同龄人来说，泰坦尼克就是一个教训那就是你必须保证为乘客准备足够的救生船这场悲剧的后果就是众多乘客因为没有足够的救生船逃生而失去了生命但是，还有一个案例，在伊斯特兰1915年有一艘船在芝加哥港沉没841人遇难—比泰坦尼克号遇难人数还多14名乘客究其原因，某种程度上说是因为船上增加了额外的救生船使得原本平衡性就很差的船更加不稳这再次证明当我们谈论无意识后果的时候从中找出教训并不是一件简单的事情这实际上是个系统问题，船是如何装载的压舱物和许多其他东西
en:Now there is something else, though, in the early 20th centurythat made things even more complicated.And that was that safety technology itselfcould be a source of danger.The lesson of the Titanic, for a lot of the contemporaries,was that you must have enough lifeboatsfor everyone on the ship.And this was the resultof the tragic loss of livesof people who could not get into them.However, there was another case, the Eastland,a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915,and it killed 841 people —that was 14 morethan the passenger toll of the Titanic.The reason for it, in part, wasthe extra life boats that were addedthat made this already unstable shipeven more unstable.And that again provesthat when you&#39;re talking about unintended consequences,it&#39;s not that easy to knowthe right lessons to draw.It&#39;s really a question of the system, how the ship was loaded,the ballast and many other things.

zh-cn:接着在20世纪我们见识了现实是多么的复杂同时也看到了其积极的一面那就是发明创造可以切实地从突发事件中受益从灾难中受益我最喜欢的案例—作为一个技术革新的奇迹却并不广为人知但是它可能是最伟大的发明之一那就是二次大战中青霉素的广泛使用青霉素诞生于1928年但直到1940年不论是在商业上或者医学上都没有大量生产当时的许多制药厂都在生产他们都在独立生产产量很有限政府研究部门把制药厂代表召集在一起告知他们必须要生产青霉素他们不仅仅按要求做了而且在两年内增加了青霉素产量从预先的一公升烧瓶增加到一万加仑的大桶这就是青霉素如何短期内迅速制造的并成为有史以来最伟大的医学进步之一还是在二战期间太阳能辐射的存在通过英国雷达站进行探测的干扰研究而发现这就从灾难中的受益—对纯粹科学研究有益同时应用科学和医学都从中受益
en:So the 20th century, then,saw how much more complex reality was,but it also saw a positive side.It saw that inventioncould actually benefit from emergencies.It could benefitfrom tragedies.And my favorite example of that —which is not really widely knownas a technological miracle,but it may be one of the greatest of all times,was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War.Penicillin was discovered in 1928,but even by 1940,no commercially and medically useful quantities of itwere being produced.A number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it.They were working on it independently,and they weren&#39;t getting anywhere.And the Government Research Bureaubrought representatives togetherand told them that this is somethingthat has to be done.And not only did they do it,but within two years,they scaled up penicillinfrom preparation in one-liter flasksto 10,000-gallon vats.That was how quickly penicillin was producedand became one of the greatest medical advances of all time.In the Second World War, too,the existenceof solar radiationwas demonstrated by studies of interferencethat was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain.So there were benefits in calamities —benefits to pure science,as well as to applied scienceand medicine.

zh-cn:现在当我们来到后二战时期无意识后果变得更加有趣我最喜欢的案例发生在1976年军团病致病病菌被研究发现一直存在与天然水中但是供热，通风和空气流通条件下水的温度能升高到有利于军团杆菌繁殖的最大化的温度科学技术开始进行补救于是药剂师们开始了研究他们发明了一种杀菌剂可以广泛地用于上述系统中
en:Now when we come to the period after the Second World War,unintended consequences get even more interesting.And my favorite example of thatoccurred beginning in 1976,when it was discoveredthat the bacteria causing Legionnaires diseasehad always been present in natural waters,but it was the precise temperature of the waterin heating, ventilating and air conditioning systemsthat raised the right temperaturefor the maximum reproductionof Legionella bacillus.Well, technology to the rescue.So chemists got to work,and they developed a bactericidethat became widely used in those systems.

zh-cn:但是19世纪80年代早期发生了一件事全美国的磁带播放器就像患上流行病一样出了故障播放器生产商IBM也不清楚应该如何应对他们委任其最好的科研团队进行调查他们发现所有出现故障的播放器都接近通风口原因就是这种杀菌药物含有微量锡这些锡微粒落在磁带的磁头部位损坏了磁头于是他们重新制造了杀菌剂但是让我感兴趣的是这是第一个致使机械设备受损的案例至少是间接由人类疾病引起的设备受损因此这表明我们其实都已经卷入其中了
en:But something else happened in the early 1980s,and that was that there was a mysterious epidemicof failures of tape drivesall over the United States.And IBM, which made them,just didn&#39;t know what to do.They commissioned a group of their best scientiststo investigate,and what they found wasthat all these tape driveswere located near ventilation ducts.What happened was the bactericide was formulatedwith minute traces of tin.And these tin particles were deposited on the tape headsand were crashing the tape heads.So they reformulated the bactericide.But what&#39;s interesting to meis that this was the first caseof a mechanical devicesuffering, at least indirectly, from a human disease.So it shows that we&#39;re really all in this together.

zh-cn:实际上它还反映了一些有意思的事情那就是虽然我们的能力和科技水平成几何级数的增长遗憾的是，我们模仿它们的同样不断增长的长期习性的能力仅仅以算术级增长因此在我们的时代，一个典型的问题就是如何消除能力增长和预见性之间的差距20世纪科技发展导致了另一个正面结果虽然形式上是通过各种灾难但却产生了积极的影响马里兰大学的两位企业史学家布伦特·戈德法布 和 大卫·基尔希做了一些关于人类发明史的非常有趣的工作大部分还尚未发表他们列出了重大的发明创造发现那些能在其它发明中体现出来的基础性发明产生数量最多最伟大的十年—他们对发明目录进行了合并—是大萧条时期
en:In fact, it also shows something interesting,that although our capabilities and technologyhave been expanding geometrically,unfortunately, our ability to model their long-term behavior,which has also been increasing,has been increasing only arithmetically.So one of the characteristic problems of our timeis how to close this gapbetween capabilities and foresight.One other very positive consequenceof 20th century technology, though,was the way in which other kinds of calamitiescould lead to positive advances.There are two historians of businessat the University of Maryland,Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch,who have done some extremely interesting work,much of it still unpublished,on the history of major innovations.They have combined the list of major innovations,and they&#39;ve discovered that the greatest number, the greatest decade,for fundamental innovations,as reflected in all of the lists that others have made —a number of lists that they have merged —was the Great Depression.

zh-cn:没有人知道为什么是这样但是有件事反映出一些问题那就是施乐复印机的诞生他们去年刚刚进行了50周年庆祝它的发明者 切斯特·卡尔森曾是一位专利代理人他其实并没有打算致力于专利研究但是他找不到其他的技术性工作所以这是他能找到的最好的工作他对于当时低质量高成本的复印技术专利很失望于是他开始发明一套干法复印系统并在19实际30年代后期申请了专利—于1960年成为了第一个用于商业用途的干式复印机因此我们看到由于这些阴错阳差由于人们改变了他们了原有的职业方向进入到一个可以通过他们的创造力带来改变的领域沮丧以及其它各种不如意反而可以对他们的创造力有刺激的效果
en:And nobody knows just why this was so,but one story can reflect something of it.It was the origin of the Xerox copier,which celebrated its 50th anniversarylast year.And Chester Carlson, the inventor,was a patent attorney.He really was not intendingto work in patent research,but he couldn&#39;t really find an alternative technical job.So this was the best job he could get.He was upset by the low quality and high costof existing patent reproductions,and so he started to developa system of dry photocopying,which he patented in the late 1930s —and which became the first dry photocopierthat was commercially practicalin 1960.So we see that sometimes,as a result of these dislocations,as a result of peopleleaving their original intended careerand going into something elsewhere their creativity could make a difference,that depressionsand all kinds of other unfortunate eventscan have a paradoxically stimulating effecton creativity.

zh-cn:这意味这什么？我认为它表明我们生活在一个存在着意外可能性的时代想一下金融圈的例子金融巨鳄沃伦·巴菲特，本杰明·格拉汉姆开发了价值投资系统正由于他自己在1929年的破产接着又于19世纪30年代初期出版了那本书现在依然再版发行着并且依旧作为基础教材因此许多重要的发明都源于人类从灾难中汲取经验
en:What does this mean?It means, I think,that we&#39;re living in a time of unexpected possibilities.Think of the financial world, for example.The mentor of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham,developed his system of value investingas a result of his own lossesin the 1929 crash.And he published that bookin the early 1930s,and the book still exists in further editionsand is still a fundamental textbook.So many important creative things can happenwhen people learn from disasters.
时间：14:02
zh-cn:想想我们现在大大小小的麻烦—臭虫 杀人蜂 垃圾邮件—那些原本用来解决上述麻烦的技术很可能在其它领域得到更大应用我们想一下，比如路易斯·巴斯德18世纪60年代被要求对丝绸行业中的蚕的疾病进行研究他的发现却成为了疾病细菌理论的开山之作这不少见，有些灾害—有些后果，比如过度种植蚕成为了当时欧洲的问题—可能比一些事情的意义更大
en:Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now —bed bugs, killer bees, spam —and it&#39;s very possible that the solutions to thosewill really extend well beyond the immediate question.If we think, for example, of Louis Pasteur,who in the 1860swas asked to studythe diseases of silk worms for the silk industry,and his discoveries were really the beginningof the germ theory of disease.So very often, some kind of disaster —sometimes the consequence, for example,of over-cultivation of silk worms,which was a problem in Europe at the time —can be the key to something much bigger.

zh-cn:因此这意味着我们需要换个角度看无意识的后果我们需要一个非常积极的态度我们要看到他可以为我们做什么我们需要从我提到的那些图表中学习我们需要，比如 从库欣博士身上学习在早期的手术中他使得病人丧失了生命他犯了些错误，是他的过失然后他非常仔细的从错误中吸取经验因此当我们说“这不是一个简单的脑外科手术”它不是用来被证明有多么困难然后被大家当作医疗领域失败案例来借鉴的脑外科手术它被认为是使其所在医疗领域前景变得堪忧的手术我们同样记得医药公司是如何汇集他们的知识去共享他们的知识在面对危急时刻之时他们也许并不是总这样做也许可以做的更早一些
en:So this meansthat we need to take a different viewof unintended consequences.We need to take a really positive view.We need to see what they can do for us.We need to learnfrom those figures that I mentioned.We need to learn, for example, from Dr. Cushing,who killed patientsin the course of his early operations.He had to have some errors. He had to have some mistakes.And he learned meticulously from his mistakes.And as a result,when we say, &quot;This isn&#39;t brain surgery,&quot;that pays tribute to how difficult it wasfor anyone to learn from their mistakesin a field of medicinethat was considered so discouraging in its prospects.And we can also rememberhow the pharmaceutical companieswere willing to pool their knowledge,to share their knowledge,in the face of an emergency,which they hadn&#39;t really been for years and years.They might have been able to do it earlier.
