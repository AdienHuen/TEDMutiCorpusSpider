zh-cn:看他们三大市场他们的产品,基本上是为交通设计家具和内饰,我们想出一个解决方案一部老式蒸汽机房车然后改造它,并试图描绘成样板房,房车,是一个新生的,当代的产物.当房车在我店露面在伯克利,事实上我从不愿停止设计无论是蒸汽房车还是其他房车.从那时起我可以一个人便更客观的审视这个新生产物看看 是否可以完善它.于是，我决定去做一些研究找出真正的问题在什么地方探索着蒸汽房车的发展史.在探索中发觉与外界的实践有些脱节然而室内实际的边角设计.外形是最初的构思未来我们的理念将会是简约时尚,高科技迅猛发展的时代.这内外截然不同的设计风格.似乎是他们借鉴了山中小茅屋.
en:So looking at their three main marketsfor their product which were basicallytransportation design,interiors and furniture,we came up with the solution of takingan old Airstream trailer and gutting it,and trying to portray laminate,and a trailer, in kind of afresh, new contemporary look.When this trailer showed up at my shopin Berkeley, I&#39;d actually never stepped foot inan Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.So I can be somebody that can look at thisin a totally fresh perspective and see if I canoptimize it in its most idealistic fashion.I decided I had to do some researchand really figure out what had gone wrongsomewhere along the history of Airstream.What I discovered in these interiors is thatthere was a disconnect between the exterior shelland the interior architecture of the pieces.In that the shell was originally conceivedas a lightweight, modern, futuristic,high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, andthe interiors were completely out of sync with that.In fact it appeared like theyreferenced a mountain cabin.

zh-cn:这看起来真像是在考验我.然而他们却不能够进一步描述对于一些喜欢逃避现实 又喜欢旅游的人.居住在房车里,再理想不过了.我们真的需要去做一些研究在房车里.去找出什么是你真正想要的蒸汽式房车,这才是我真正的目的和用途.我们除去了所有的乙烯.使用zolatone油漆这仅仅是幻想中的铝外壳.我们修剪了所有的金属边缘这看起来像是一座郊区小茅屋.我全心投入到房车墙面的手绘中,像是在纸板上作画,我们一直在商讨,哪些地方出了问题,把它们纠正,改进.
en:That seemed really like a crisis to me,that they had never been able todevelop a vocabularyabout escape, and about travel, and modernityin this trailer that was consistent with the shell.We really needed to do some archeologyin the trailer itself to figure out what&#39;s authenticin an Airstream trailer,and what feels like it has true purpose and utility.We stripped out all the vinyland zolatone paint that was covering upthis just fantastic aluminum shell.We took off all the visible hardware and trimthat was kind of doing the country cabin thing.I literally drew on the walls of the trailer,mocked it up in cardboard,we&#39;d come in and cut, decide things were wrong,pull it out, put it back in.

zh-cn:其主要目的是:完成室内设计,之后我们便征集议案,可移动性和独立性.对这些房车来说这是最大的困难问题是当你设计时没有逻辑的地方停止使用材料,由于房车的窗体整体性.还没有连接两个墙壁和天花板的东西可以粘合在一起,可以改变材料和形状.因此,成为了一个挑战.粘合,材料上我们选择薄板,当时我试着突出这种材料仅弯曲成两种规格.一个是复合的室内曲线设计.这就是我不得不制定一种欺骗眼球的方法来相信这些的面板有着像贝壳一样的曲线.
en:The main goal was to smooth out the interior,and begin to speak about motion,and mobility, and independence.The biggest difficulty on one of these trailersis that when you&#39;re designing there&#39;s actually nological place to stop and start materialsbecause of the continuous form of the trailer.There&#39;s no such things as two walls and a ceilingcoming together, where you can change materials and shapes.So that became a challenge.Compounding that,the material of choice, laminate,that I was trying to highlight,only bends in two dimensions.It&#39;s a compound curve interior.What I had to devise wasa way of fooling the eyeinto believing that all these panelsare curved with the shell.

zh-cn:这是提供来的是一系列第二层外观,外壳基本上是铝做的然后我试着去做的是在空间里引导你的眼睛,这样你会看到不同的几何图形.并且不会打破空间的协调性.他们也了我们一个使用电力的方法把电线埋在薄板里边.他们对电的使用.这样我们就几乎完成了该房车.
en:What I came up with wasa series of second skinsthat basically float over the aluminum shell.And what I was trying to do there wasdirect your eye in the space,so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way,and that the casework wouldn&#39;t break up the space.They also gave us a way to run powerand rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin,so they function as an electrical chase.That&#39;s the trailer, pretty much finished.

zh-cn:由于这房车让我们有幸参加另一个委员会,一个叫做东京设计师的晚会.这个家具设计在东京的十月持续一周.Teruo Kurosaki, 他拥有着一个叫做Idee的公司他拜托我运送两辆房车到东京来.他说他想制作一个真正的,使用性高的房车,并卖出去.这两辆房车,就像你有一张白纸,你可以做任何你想做的.
en:That trailer led to another commission,to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee,he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.He said one he would like tomake a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.

zh-cn:我们提出一个DJ环游美国的充满幻想的方案.这将边收集记录,边旅行.房车里将内置两台唱盘机,混音器、酒吧、冰箱、综合音响系统.它还有个巨大的沙发，可以坐下几个人.我们度过了一段非常美好的时光.当我看到这房车,连我也想有去旅行,去逃离的冲动.这是种别具一格的感觉.将很多的想法移植到蒸汽房车的生产中.
en:We came up with a fantasy scenarioof a DJ traveling around the States,that would collect records and go on tours.This trailer housed two turntables,mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.It&#39;s got a huge couch, fits quite a few people,and basically we&#39;d had a great time with this.And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel,and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.A lot of these ideas migrated intothe production trailers for Airstream.

zh-cn:这段时间我开始请教气流。他们对我说：&quot;好，我们能做些什么把它变的更有新鲜感？”你认为孩子们，他们知道滑板，冲浪者，攀岩登山者，会使用这些东西&quot;？我说：“嗯，这些运动并不在室内.”(笑声)无论如何.我处理这个模型时我们修改过6次.它被叫做小鹿斑比原型.我想, 最终完成了,在这个伟大公司里,我会跟重要人物一起工作致力于工具和模具.然而我参观他们的模型设施,这太像我的店铺了,只是更大一些,一样的工具, 一样的东西.事实上.他们让我走入了困境,使用我们现有的技术进行内部设计,而且没有免费的工具和模型.房车实际上是我们自己动手打造.所有的部分是独创.独特的,所以你不能复制出100件一样的房车,你要为他们量身定做.他们不是千篇一律.然而,这就是小鹿斑比16号.(掌声)
en:This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.They came to me and said,&quot;Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers,rock climbers, would use these things?&quot;And I said, &quot;Well, not in that interior.&quot;(Laughter)Anyway, I went out to Airstreamabout six times during the process of building this prototype,and it&#39;s called the Bambi prototype.I thought, &quot;Finally, oh yeah great,big company, I&#39;m gonna work with somebody with moneyfor tooling and molding.&quot;And I walked in their prototype facility, andit&#39;s exactly like my shop, only bigger —same tools, same things.So the problem became — and they set this dilemma to me —that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology,and there&#39;s no money for tooling or molding.The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely,so you can&#39;t just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers,you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.They didn&#39;t want to go to a componentized system.And there it is, that&#39;s the Bambi 16.(Applause)
