zh-cn:♫我不理解自己♫♫为何他们一直谈论爱情♫♫如果他们靠近我♫♫如果他们看着我的眼睛亲吻我的手♫♫我不理解自己♫♫为何他们谈论奇迹♫♫你战也枉然♫♫如果你看到我，如果你经过我♫♫如果红色的灯♫♫亮在深夜里♫♫每个人听我歌唱♫♫那么显而易见♫♫他们在我唇上留下火热的亲吻♫♫我柔软的四肢♫♫这是命中注定♫♫你当亲吻，你当热恋♫♫我的双脚，在滑动徜徉♫♫我的双眼，诱人而闪亮♫♫我着迷一样跳舞，因为我知道♫♫我的唇有火热地吻♫♫我的血液里♫♫流着舞者的血♫♫因为我美丽的母亲♫♫是移动城堡里的♫♫舞后♫♫她是如此美丽♫♫我常常梦到她♫♫她打着手鼓♫♫和着旖旎的舞姿，每一双眼睛都流露爱慕♫♫她在我体内复苏♫♫我也是如此♫♫我在午夜像她一样跳舞♫♫我深深感受：♫♫他们在我唇上留下火热的亲吻♫♫我柔软的四肢♫♫这是命中注定♫♫你当亲吻，你当热恋♫♫我着迷一样跳舞，因为我知道♫♫我的唇有着火热地吻♫
en:♫ I don&#39;t understand myself, ♫♫ why they keep talking of love, ♫♫ if they come near me, ♫♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand. ♫♫ I don&#39;t understand myself, ♫♫ why they talk of magic, ♫♫ that no one withstands, ♫♫ if he sees me, if he passes by. ♫♫ But if the red light is on ♫♫ in the middle of the night ♫♫ and everybody listens to my song, ♫♫ then it is plain to see. ♫♫ My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ♫♫ my limbs, they are supple and soft. ♫♫ It is written for me in the stars, ♫♫ thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ♫♫ My feet, they glide and float, ♫♫ my eyes, they lure and glow. ♫♫ And I dance as if entranced, &#39;cause I know, ♫♫ my lips give so fiery a kiss. ♫♫ In my veins, ♫♫ runs a dancer&#39;s blood, ♫♫ because my beautiful mother ♫♫ was the Queen of dance ♫♫ in the gilded Alcazar. ♫♫ She was so very beautiful, ♫♫ I often saw her in my dreams. ♫♫ If she beat the tambourine ♫♫ to her beguiling dance,all eyes were glowing admiringly. ♫♫ She reawakened in me, ♫♫ mine is the same lot. ♫♫ I dance like her at midnight ♫♫ and from deep within I feel: ♫♫ My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ♫♫ my limbs, they are supple and soft. ♫♫ It is written for me in the stars, ♫♫ thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ♫♫ And I dance as if entranced, &#39;cause I know, ♫♫ my lips give so fiery a kiss. ♫
