zh-cn:我想谈论的是年轻人和结构年轻人和结构这是上周三下午在纽约布鲁克林区一所学校由耶稣会经营的Cristo Rey高中当时我对这群学生演讲，并观察他们他们以三个方向环绕着我你们注意到他们几乎都是少数族群你们注意到这栋建筑十分简陋这是一栋老旧的纽约校舍，十分简朴他们仍使用旧式黑板等设备大约300名孩子在这所学校就读这所学校已成立四年首届学生即将毕业毕业生共有二十二人二十二人都会上大学他们全都来自于－大多来自于只有一位亲人的家庭通常是母亲或祖母，仅此而已他们来这里接受教育及结构训练
en:I want to talk about young people and structure,young people and structure.This was last Wednesday afternoonat a school in Brooklyn, New York,at Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits.And I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them.They were around me in three directions.You&#39;ll noticed that almost all of them are minority.You&#39;ll notice that the building is rather austere.It&#39;s an old New York school building, nothing fancy.They still have old blackboards and whatnot.And there are about 300 kids in this school,and the school&#39;s been going now for four years,and they&#39;re about to graduate their first class.Twenty-two people are graduating,and all 22 are going to college.They all come from homes where there is, for the most part,just one person in the home,usually the mother or the grandmother, and that&#39;s it,and they come here for their educationand for their structure.

zh-cn:他看起来确实不错，因为孩子需要结构我每次造访学校，必定会玩个把戏当我稍微向孩子们说教后接着会邀请他们发问当他们举起手时，我会说，“到台上来”让他们在我面前站好我让他们像士兵一样立正双臂笔直地贴在身侧抬头挺胸、睁大双眼、直视前方大声说出问题，让每个人都能听见不可弯腰驼背不可衣衫不整地穿垮裤等（笑声）这位年轻人，名字是－他姓Cruz－他爱极了，在Facebook上大肆宣扬，使这件事广为流传（笑声）所以人们认为我刁难这个孩子并非如此，我们乐在其中至于这样的事，我已行之多年在年纪越小的孩子身上效果越有趣
en:He does look good, because kids need structure,and the trick I play in all of my school appearancesis that when I get through with my little homily to the kids,I then invite them to ask questions,and when they raise their hands, I say, &quot;Come up,&quot;and I make them come up and stand in front of me.I make them stand at attention like a soldier.Put your arms straight down at your side,look up, open your eyes, stare straight ahead,and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear.No slouching, no pants hanging down, none of that stuff.(Laughter)And this young man, his name is — his last name Cruz —he loved it. That&#39;s all over his Facebook page and it&#39;s gone viral.(Laughter)So people think I&#39;m being unkind to this kid.No, we&#39;re having a little fun.And the thing about it, I&#39;ve done this for years,the younger they are, the more fun it is.

zh-cn:总之这是我玩的一个游戏，显然这来自于我的军事生涯体验因为我成年后大半时光都和年轻人共事，我称他们为“持枪青年”我们将他们带入军队我们所做的第一件事，就是将他们放入组织境里，将他们放入行伍中让他们全都穿着相同服装剃短头发，让他们看起来如出一辙确保他们能列队站好我们教他们如何向右转、向左转让他们服从指示了解不服从指示的后果这让他们明白何谓组织结构然后向他们介绍一位他们立刻会痛恨的人，士官长他们对他恨之入骨士官长开始对他们大声呼喊命令他们做各种难为的事但随着时光流逝最令人惊异的事逐渐发生一旦发展出那种组织结构一旦他们明白某件事的道理一旦他们明白，“妈妈不在这里，孩子”“我是你们最糟的噩梦，我是你们的父母”“明白吗？事实就是如此，了解吗，孩子？”“当我问你们问题时，只有三个可能答案”“是，长官；不，长官；没有理由，长官”“别告诉我为何你们没做到某件事”“你只能回答：是，长官；不，长官；没有理由，长官”
en:But anyway, it&#39;s a game I play, and it comes obviouslyfrom my military experience.Because for the majority of my adult life,I worked with young kids, teenagers with guns, I call them.And we would bring them into the army,and the first thing we would do is to put themin an environment of structure, put them in ranks,make them all wear the same clothes,cut all their hair off so they look alike,make sure that they are standing in ranks.We teach them how to go right face, left face,so they can obey instructions and knowthe consequences of not obeying instructions.It gives them structure.And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately, the drill sergeant.And they hate him.And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them,and telling them to do all kinds of awful things.But then the most amazing thing happens over time.Once that structure is developed,once they understand the reason for something,once they understand, &quot;Mama ain&#39;t here, son.I&#39;m your worst nightmare. I&#39;m your daddy and your mommy.And that&#39;s just the way it is. You got that, son?Yeah, and then when I ask you a question, there are only three possible answers:yes, sir; no, sir; and no excuse, sir.Don&#39;t start telling me why you didn&#39;t do something.It&#39;s yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir.&quot;

zh-cn:但你会惊讶于能让他们做到的事一旦你将他们放入那个组织结构中后十八周后，他们会拥有一身本领，他们会变得成熟知道吗？他们开始钦佩士官长他们对士官长永难忘怀他们开始尊敬他因此我们需要将更多这种结构和尊敬灌输到孩子的生活中
en:But you&#39;d be amazed at what you can do with themonce you put them in that structure.In 18 weeks, they have a skill. They are mature.And you know what, they come to admire the drill sergeantand they never forget the drill sergeant.They come to respect him.And so we need more of this kind of structure and respectin the lives of our children.

zh-cn:我花了很多时间和年轻人相处当我询问人们，“教育过程从何时开始？”大家总是说，“让我们改善学校”“让我们为教师提供更多方案让我们在学校装设更多计算机”“让我们将一切放上网络”
en:I spend a lot of time with youth groups,and I say to people, &quot;When does the education process begin?&quot;We&#39;re always talking about, &quot;Let&#39;s fix the schools.Let&#39;s do more for our teachers. Let&#39;s put more computers in our schools.Let&#39;s get it all online.&quot;

zh-cn:那并非全部答案，仅是部分答案但真正答案从孩子入学开始将组织结构的概念灌输到孩子心灵中
en:That isn&#39;t the whole answer. It&#39;s part of the answer.But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the schoolwith structure in that child&#39;s heart and soul to begin with.
时间： 5:21
zh-cn:学习过程从何时开始？从一年级开始吗？不，不，它开始于孩子第一次在母亲怀中仰视母亲时心想，“喔，这必定是我的母亲”“她是抚育我的人”“喔，是的，当我不舒服时”“她会照料我”“我将学习她的语言”那时，他们会将所有那个年纪能学习的其他语言都拒之门外在最初三个月中，只听得进她的语言如果做这件事的人，无论是母亲或祖母，无论做这件事的人是谁那就是教育过程的开始那就是语言的开始那就是爱的开始，那就是结构的开始那就是当你开始对孩子灌输“你是特别的”“你和世上任何其他孩子都不同”“我们会念书给你听”不曾听过他人念书的孩子入学后将处于风险中一位不知道自己肤色的孩子或不知道如何看时间，不知道如何系鞋带不知道如何做那些事不知道如何遵守自小就扎根于我脑海的字眼：注意注意你的举止！注意身边的大人！注意你说的话！这就是正确教养孩子的方式当我现在观察自己年幼孙辈的言行他们令我的孩子苦恼万分他们的反应就像当年的我们知道吗？你们让他们深受影响
en:When does the learning process begin? Does it begin in first grade?No, no, it begins the first timea child in a mother&#39;s armslooks up at the motherand says, &quot;Oh, this must be my mother.She&#39;s the one who feeds me.Oh yeah, when I don&#39;t feel so good down there,she takes care of me.It&#39;s her language I will learn.&quot;And at that moment they shut out all the other languagesthat they could be learning at that age,but by three months, that&#39;s her.And if the person doing it, whether it&#39;s the motheror grandmother, whoever&#39;s doing it,that is when the education process begins.That&#39;s when language begins.That&#39;s when love begins. That&#39;s when structure begins.That&#39;s when you start to imprint on the childthat &quot;you are special,you are different from every other child in the world.And we&#39;re going to read to you.&quot;A child who has not been read tois in danger when that child gets to school.A child who doesn&#39;t know his or her colorsor doesn&#39;t know how to tell time, doesn&#39;t know how to tie shoes,doesn&#39;t know how to do those things,and doesn&#39;t know how to do something thatgoes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid: mind.Mind your manners! Mind your adults! Mind what you&#39;re saying!This is the way children are raised properly.And I watched my own young grandchildren now come alongand they&#39;re, much to the distress of my children,they are acting just like we did. You know? You imprint them.

zh-cn:你们必须做的事就是让孩子为接受教育和上学做准备现在，我竭尽所能地宣扬这个讯息我们需要学前教育，我们需要启蒙计划我们需要胎教教育过程甚至在孩子诞生之前已经开始如果不这么做，将会面临困境许多小区面临这些困境许多学校中的孩子成为一年级新生时，他们双眼发亮他们背上小背包，准备上学然后发现自己不像其他一年级生一样熟知书中内容他们已经听过，看得懂英文字母到了三年级，那些一开始缺乏那种结构和思维的孩子开始意识到自己落后他人，他们怎么做？他们表现脱轨行为，然后踏上通往监狱之路，或踏上辍学之路这是意料之事如果到了三年级时，你的阅读能力不及格到了十八岁，就是入狱的候选者我们拥有最高的入监率因为我们没有让孩子的生命拥有正确的开始
en:And that&#39;s what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school.And I&#39;m working at all the energy I haveto sort of communicate this message thatwe need preschool, we need Head Start,we need prenatal care.The education process begins even before the child is born,and if you don&#39;t do that, you&#39;re going to have difficulty.And we are having difficulties in so many of our communitiesand so many of our schools where kids are comingto first grade and their eyes are blazing,they&#39;ve got their little knapsack on and they&#39;re ready to go,and then they realize they&#39;re not like the other first graderswho know books, have been read to, can do their alphabet.And by the third grade, the kids who didn&#39;t havethat structure and minding in the beginningstart to realize they&#39;re behind, and what do they do?They act it out. They act it out, and they&#39;re on their wayto jail or they&#39;re on their way to being dropouts.It&#39;s predictable.If you&#39;re not at the right reading level at third grade,you are a candidate for jail at age 18,and we have the highest incarceration ratebecause we&#39;re not getting our kids the proper start in life.

zh-cn:我有幸拥有这种好的开始我并非一位杰出学生我就读于纽约市一所公立学校各方面表现都不佳我从纽约市教育局取得一份从幼儿园到大学的完整成绩单于撰写第一本着作时申请我想知道我的记忆是否正确天哪，确实如此（笑声）从头到尾都是C我终于在高中时期翻身进入纽约市立学院以平均78.3分的成绩我本来应该无法录取我最初主修工程学仅持续了六个月（笑声）然后转攻地质学“捡石头运动”，简单极了然后我发现ROTC（大学储备军官训练团）我发现某样我擅长且喜欢的事我发现一群志同道合的年轻人因此我将毕生奉献于ROTC和军方我经常对年轻人说，随着年龄增长随着这种结构在你身上成长茁壮努力不懈地寻找你所擅长及喜爱的事当你发现两者吻合时，老兄，你找到了这就是我的经历，这就是我的领悟
en:I was privileged to have that kind of good start.I was not a great student.I was a public school kid in New York City,and I didn&#39;t do well at all.I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcriptfrom kindergarten through college.I wanted it when I was writing my first book.I wanted to see if my memory was correct,and, my God, it was. (Laughter)Straight C everywhere.And I finally bounced through high school,got into the City College of New Yorkwith a 78.3 average, which I shouldn&#39;t have been allowed in with,and then I started out in engineering,and that only lasted six months. (Laughter)And then I went into geology, &quot;rocks for jocks.&quot; This is easy.And then I found ROTC.I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing,and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way.And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military.And I say to young kids everywhere, as you&#39;re growing upand as this structure is being developed inside of you,always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing,and when you find those two things together, man, you got it.That&#39;s what&#39;s going on. And that&#39;s what I found.

zh-cn:此时，纽约市立学院越来越厌倦我的存在我在那里读了四年半，将近五年我的成绩不甚理想我和校方不时有些摩擦因此他们说，“但他在ROTC表现优异”“看，他在那方面全都拿A，但其他方面都不行”因此他们说：“好，我们不妨采用他的ROTC成绩”“并入大学平均成绩（Overall GPA），看看情况如何”他们这么做了，使我的GPA上升到2.0（笑声）没错（笑声）（掌声）他们说，“这个成绩足以进政府单位”“把他送入军队我们再也不会见到他，我们再也不会见到他”因此他们把我送入军队瞧，多年后我被认为是纽约市立学院最杰出的校友之一（笑声）因此，我经常对年轻人说并非生命的起点而是你如何挥洒生命决定了生命的结果你有幸生活在这个国家无论从何处起步，都拥有机会只要你相信自己相信这个社会和国家相信你可以自我提升随时自我教育那就是成功的关键
en:Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there.I&#39;d been there four and a half going on five years,and my grades were not doing particularly well,and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration.And so they said, &quot;But he does so well in ROTC.Look, he gets straight A&#39;s in that but not in anything else.&quot;And so they said, &quot;Look, let&#39;s take his ROTC gradesand roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens.&quot;And they did, and it brought me up to 2.0. (Laughter)Yep. (Laughter) (Applause)They said, &quot;It&#39;s good enough for government work.Give him to the army. We&#39;ll never see him again. We&#39;ll never see him again.&quot;So they shipped me off to the army,and lo and behold, many years later,I&#39;m considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had. (Laughter)So, I tell young people everywhere,it ain&#39;t where you start in life, it&#39;s what you do with lifethat determines where you end up in life,and you are blessed to be living in a country that,no matter where you start, you have opportunitiesso long as you believe in yourself,you believe in the society and the country,and you believe that you can self-improveand educate yourself as you go along.And that&#39;s the key to success.
