zh-cn:作为一个搞研究的人时不时会遇到一些令人不安的问题这些问题可以改变你对周围世界的认识让你认识到 之前所深信的看法其实存在很大的谬误这些都是不幸的时刻因为你在那晚入睡时要比在早上起床时来得无知这也正是我本次演讲的目标第一 相互交流各自的体会第二 让你们在离开会场时比你们进来时更加无知一点希望我能达到这两点目标
en:As a researcher, every once in a whileyou encounter somethinga little disconcerting.And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you,and teaches you that you&#39;re very wrongabout something that you really believed firmly in.And these are unfortunate moments,because you go to sleep that nightdumber than when you woke up.So, that&#39;s really the goal of my talk,is to A, communicate that moment to youand B, have you leave this sessiona little dumber than when you entered.So, I hope I can really accomplish that.

zh-cn:我要讲的这个问题要从痢疾开始我们对痢疾的病因已经很熟悉所以我放了一杯水的照片在那对在座的各位来说 这是个麻烦对婴儿来说 这是致命的他们缺乏营养 痢疾会导致脱水因此 会有很多人夭折很多人夭折在1960年的印度新生儿的死亡率达到24%很多还能没能挺过去 实在是很不幸很重要的一个原因就是痢疾目前 人类已对痢疾的疗法付出了很大努力也出现了很有效的疗法这种疗法被某些人称为本世纪最重要的医学突破
en:So, this incident that I&#39;m going to describereally began with some diarrhea.Now, we&#39;ve known for a long time the cause of diarrhea.That&#39;s why there&#39;s a glass of water up there.For us, it&#39;s a problem, the people in this room.For babies, it&#39;s deadly.They lack nutrients, and diarrhea dehydrates them.And so, as a result, there is a lot of death,a lot of death.In India in 1960,there was a 24 percent child mortality rate,lots of people didn&#39;t make it. This is incredibly unfortunate.One of the big reasons this happened wasbecause of diarrhea.Now, there was a big effort to solve this problem,and there was actually a big solution.This solution has been called, by some,&quot;potentially the most important medicaladvance this century.&quot;

zh-cn:疗法其实很简单就是口服补液盐很多人用过这种方法这是个天才般的想法可以让钠和葡萄糖混合在一起 掺上水之后婴儿即使在身患痢疾时也能吸收养分有效的减少了死亡率很好的治疗了痢疾婴儿死亡率从1960年的24%下降到如今的6.5%
en:Now, the solution turned out to be simple.And what it was was oral rehydration salts.Many of you have probably used this.It&#39;s brilliant. It&#39;s a way to get sodiumand glucose together so that when you add it to waterthe child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea.Remarkable impact on mortality.Massive solution to the problem.Flash forward: 1960, 24 percent child mortalityhas dropped to 6.5 percent today.
时间： 2:06
zh-cn:比例仍较高 但已经降了很多看上去技术上的问题已解决但直到如今光是在印度 每年就有40万痢疾相关的死亡这又是怎么回事?你可以说 我们没有给他们提供口服补液盐事实上不是这样在这些地方 口服补液盐完全可以买到价格很低 甚至是免费的 但死亡还在发生也许有生理上的原因也许单靠再水合的方法无法挽救这些生命 但这也不是事实很多死亡是完全可以避免的这就是令我感到不安的问题我称之为&quot;最后一英里&quot;问题
en:Still a big number, but a big drop.It looks like the technological problem is solved.But if you look, even todaythere are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deathsin India alone.What&#39;s going on here?Well the easy answer is, we just haven&#39;t gotten those saltsto those people.That&#39;s actually not true.If you look in areas where these salts are completely available,the price is low or zero, these deaths still continue abated.Maybe there&#39;s a biological answer.Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydrationalone doesn&#39;t solve. That&#39;s not true either.Many of these deaths were completely preventable,and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing,what I want to call &quot;the last mile&quot; problem.

zh-cn:我们在各个领域消耗了很多的资源利用技术 科学手段通过人类的汗水 灵巧 创造力用技术手段攻克了许多重大社会问题2000年以来都是如此人类因此不断向前进尽管攻克了很多难关但还有很多问题依然存在前面的999英里都走得很好最好一英里显得异常艰难
en:See, we spent a lot of energy, in many domains —technological, scientific, hard work,creativity, human ingenuity —to crack important social problems with technology solutions.That&#39;s been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years,that&#39;s mankind moving forward.But in this case we cracked it,but a big part of the problem still remains.Nine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well,the last mile&#39;s proving incredibly stubborn.

zh-cn:口服补液疗法就是如此也许痢疾只是一个特例但事实上 痢疾不是特例这样问题就变得令人不安了甚至印度的穷人也不是特例这是从很多文献中找到的一个例子我在这列举了很多例子
en:Now, that&#39;s for oral rehydration therapy.Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea.Well, it turns out — and this is where things get really disconcerting —it&#39;s not unique to diarrhea.It&#39;s not even unique to poor people in India.Here&#39;s an example from a variety of contexts.I&#39;ve put a bunch of examples up here.

zh-cn:我从美国治疗糖尿病的胰岛素说起对美国人来说如果你很穷或者你有医疗保险就能得到医疗补助 胰岛素很好用可通过药片或注射使用每天都要服用 以保持血糖水平这是巨大的技术进步让致命的疾病变得可治愈看看相关的数据 每天有多少人服用胰岛素?平均每人服用的概率是75%结果就是 每年有2万5千人失明数十万人截肢而这个病是可治愈的
en:I&#39;ll start with insulin, diabetesmedication in the U.S.OK, the American population.On Medicaid — if you&#39;re fairly poor you get Medicaid,or if you have health insurance — insulin is pretty straightforward.You get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection;you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.Massive technological advance:took an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable.Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?About on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time.As a result, 25,000 people a year go blind,hundreds of thousands lose limbs, every year,for something that&#39;s solvable.
时间： 4:10
zh-cn:我还能举很多其他的例子他们都存在最后一英里的问题不仅仅在医学上这是另一个来自于技术革新的例子农业 我们认为存在食物问题 所以发明了新型的种子我们认为存在产量的问题 因此创造了增加产量的新方法我们来看看那些已经实现的老方法间作 间作确实能增加产量有时 通过混合不同种类的水稻可以得到惊人的常量有些人这么做了有些人没有 为什么会这样?这就是最后一英里最后一英里的问题 无处不在 难以攻克
en:Here I have a bunch of other examples,all suffer from the last mile problem.It&#39;s not just medicine.Here&#39;s another example from technology:agriculture. We thinkthere&#39;s a food problem, so we create new seeds.We think there&#39;s an income problem, so we createnew ways of farming that increase income.Well, look at some old ways, some ways that we&#39;d already cracked.Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income.Sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yieldwhen you mix different varieties of rice side by side.Some people are doing that,many are not. What&#39;s going on?This is the last mile.The last mile is, everywhere, problematic.

zh-cn:问题出在哪?问题就处在这个3磅重的小机器上它位于你的眼后 两耳之间这台机器很奇怪结果是 人类也很奇怪做了很多自相矛盾的事(鼓掌)人做了很多自相矛盾的事这些自相矛盾从根本上导致了最后一英里问题当我们面对生物 细菌基因 内脏 血液这些的时候尽管很复杂 但却是可控的当我们面对人的问题的时候就变得更为复杂了事情就不好控制了 这就是我们在挣扎的问题
en:Alright, what&#39;s the problem?The problem is this little three-pound machinethat&#39;s behind your eyes and between your ears.This machine is really strange,and one of the consequences is that people are weird.They do lots of inconsistent things.(Applause)They do lots of inconsistent things.And the inconsistenciescreate, fundamentally, this last mile problem.See, when we were dealing with our biology, bacteria,the genes, the things inside here, the blood?That&#39;s complex, but it&#39;s manageable.When we&#39;re dealing with people like this?The mind is more complex.That&#39;s not as manageable, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re struggling with.
时间： 5:30
zh-cn:我们再回到痢疾的问题上这是全国抽样调查组织向很多印度女性问的一个问题&quot;如果小孩得了痢疾应该增加 保持还是减少液体摄入?&quot;为了不让你们难堪 我直接告诉你们答案是增加痢疾很有意思它已经存在了几千年自从人类聚居开始产生废水以来就有了罗马人有个对付痢疾的办法很有意思这让他们取得了比较优势他们连轻微浑浊的水都不让士兵们饮用因为如果有士兵得了立即就会削弱战斗力大家以为罗马军队的优势在于护甲但其实正确饮水也是优势之一
en:Let me go back to diarrhea for a second.Here&#39;s a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey,which is a survey asked of many Indian women:&quot;Your child has diarrhea.Should you increase, maintain or decrease the number of fluids?&quot;Just so you don&#39;t embarrass yourselves, I&#39;ll give you the right answer:It&#39;s increase.Now, diarrhea&#39;s interestingbecause it&#39;s been around for thousands of years,ever since humankind reallylived side by side enough to have really polluted water.One Roman strategy that was very interestingwas that — and it really gave them a comparative advantage —they made sure their soldiers didn&#39;t drinkeven remotely muddied waters.Because if some of your troops get diarrhea they&#39;re not that effectiveon the battlefield.So, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields,the breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water.

zh-cn:所以这些妇女们见过父母为痢疾所困扰 自己也患过痢疾还见过很多死亡病例 她们会如何回答呢?在印度 35%到50%的人回答 &quot;减少&quot;想一下这意味着什么35%到50%的妇女忽略了口服补液疗法她们在增加...她们这么做其实是在增加孩子的死亡率怎么会这样呢?一种可能是 我想大部分人会这样回答&quot;真愚蠢&quot;我觉得这不是愚蠢我认为这些妇女在某种程度上做的是对的也就是 不把水倒在漏的水桶里
en:So, here are these women. They&#39;ve seen their parentshave struggled with diarrhea, they&#39;ve struggled with diarrhea,they&#39;ve seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question?In India, 35 to 50 percent say &quot;Reduce.&quot;Think about what that means for a second.Thirty-five to 50 percent of womenforget oral rehydration therapy,they are increasing —they are actually making their childmore likely to die through their actions.How is that possible?Well, one possibility — I think that&#39;s how most people respond to this —is to say, &quot;That&#39;s just stupid.&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s stupid.I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing.And that is, you don&#39;t put waterinto a leaky bucket.

zh-cn:这个思维模型就是减少输入只是听上去不太合理这个模型本来是正确的但是应用到实际当中就发生了错误但是从深层次上来讲 是有道理的这对我来说 就是那个最基本的最后一英里的挑战
en:So, think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake.Just doesn&#39;t make sense.Now, the model is intuitively right.It just doesn&#39;t happen to be right about the world.But it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level.And that, to me, is the fundamental challengeof the last mile.
时间： 7:26
zh-cn:第一个挑战我称之为 说服劝说别人去做某件事接受口服补液疗法 间作 诸如此类的不是说是去提供给人信息&quot;我们给他们罗列数据吧他们看到数据 就会做正确的事&quot;实际远比这复杂的多为了让你们理解为什么会显得更复杂我们先来做一个有意思的测验
en:This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge.Convincing people to do something —take oral rehydration therapy, intercrop, whatever it might be —is not an act of information:&quot;Let&#39;s give them the data,and when they have data they&#39;ll do the right thing.&quot;It&#39;s more complex than that.And if you want to understand how it&#39;s more complexlet me start with something kind of interesting.

zh-cn:我会给你们一道简单的数学题需要你们尽可能快的给出答案一个球拍和一个球总计1.1美元球拍比球多花1美元那么一个球要花多少钱? 要快那边有人说5美分不少人说10美分先来考虑下10这个答案如果球是10美分 球拍要花...很简单 1.1美元所以总共要花1.2美元你们都明显是受过教育的人很多看起来很聪明这几点加起来反而让你们得出错误的答案
en:I&#39;m going to give you a little math problem,and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible.A bat and a ball together cost $1.10.The bat costs a dollar more than the ball.How much does the ball cost? Quick.So, somebody out there says, &quot;Five.&quot;A lot of you said, &quot;Ten.&quot;Let&#39;s think about 10 for a second.If the ball costs 10, the bat costs...this is easy, $1.10.Yeah. So, together they would cost $1.20.So, here you all are, ostensibly educated people.Most of you look smart.The combination of that producessomething that is actually, you got this thing wrong.

zh-cn:怎么会这样? 再看看其他的我知道代数很复杂所以让我们回到...5年级? 4年级?我们回到幼儿园 好不好?美国有个很赞的电视节目不得不看叫做&quot;你比小学5年级的聪明吗?&quot;我想我们刚才已经有了答案我们回到幼儿园水平 看看能否打败5岁孩子接下来 我会在屏幕上显示一些物体我要你们念出这些物体的颜色就这么简单 明白了吗?
en:How is that possible? Let&#39;s go to something else.I know algebra can be complicated.So, let&#39;s dial this back. That&#39;s what? Fifth grade? Fourth grade?Let&#39;s go back to kindergarten. OK?There&#39;s a great show on American television that you have to watch.It&#39;s called &quot;Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?&quot;I think we&#39;ve learned the answer to that here.Let&#39;s move to kindergarten. Let&#39;s see if we can beat five-year-olds.Here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do: I&#39;m going to put objects on the screen.I just want you to name the color of the object.That&#39;s all it is. OK?

en:Sendhil Mullainathan: That&#39;s pretty good.Almost out of kindergarten.What is all this telling us?You see, what&#39;s going on here, and in the bat and ball problemis that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world,some models that you use to understand the world.These models, like the leaky bucket,work well in most situations.I suspect most of you —I hope that&#39;s true for the rest of you —actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world.

en:I found a problem, a specific problemthat actually found an error with that.Diarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that.They are situations where the mental modeldoesn&#39;t match the reality.Same thing here:You had an intuitive response to this that was very quick.You read &quot;blue&quot; and you wanted to say &quot;blue,&quot; even though you knew your task was red.

zh-cn:我做这个实验 是因为这很有趣但这不仅仅在于它是有趣的关于说服力 我给大家举个很好的例子宝马是安全性很高的车他们在想 &quot;安全性是卖点我要宣传这个卖点 应该怎么宣传呢?&quot;&quot;可以给出数据 说我们的撞击测试性能很好&quot;但事实是 当你注视着辆车的时候他不像沃尔沃也不想悍马
en:Now, I do this stuff because it&#39;s fun.But it&#39;s more profound than fun.I&#39;ll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion.BMW is a pretty safe car.And they are trying to figure out, &quot;Safety is good.I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?&quot;&quot;I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests.&quot;But the truth of the matter is, you look at that car,it doesn&#39;t look like a Volvo,and it doesn&#39;t look like a Hummer.

zh-cn:我想让你们思考几分钟如果是你 怎么宣传宝马的安全性? 好吗?你们边思考边看第二个任务第二个任务就是省油
en:So, what I want you to think about for a few minutesis: How would you convey safety of the BMW? Okay?So now, while you&#39;re thinking about that let&#39;s move to a second task.The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay?

zh-cn:再给你们出道题有个人走进车场他想买辆丰田的飞度他说 &quot;这车每加仑能跑35英里我要环保的 我想买普锐斯每加仑能跑50英里&quot;另一个人走进车场想买悍马 每加仑跑9英里厚实 奢华他说道 &quot;我真的需要涡轮增压器吗?需要那么重的车吗?我要做对环境有益的事我要减掉那部分重量我要买辆每加仑能跑11英里的悍马&quot;
en:Here&#39;s another puzzle for all of you.One person walks into a car lot,and they&#39;re thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris.They are saying, &quot;This is 35 miles per gallon. I&#39;m going to dothe environmentally right thing, I&#39;m going to buy the Prius,50 miles per gallon.&quot;Another person walks into the lot,and they&#39;re about to buy a Hummer, nine miles per gallon,fully loaded, luxury.And they say, &quot;You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?&quot;I&#39;m going to do something good for the environment.I&#39;m going to take off some of that weight,and I&#39;m going to buy a Hummer that&#39;s 11 miles per gallon.&quot;
时间：11:09
zh-cn:哪个人对环境的贡献更大呢?在大家的思维方式中50到35是很大的差距 11到9呢? 不会吧但如果用心计算一下的话9到11的提升贡献更大 那人能省更多的油为什么? 因为我们不在乎每加仑的里程我们在乎每英里的耗油想想看 这在鼓励节油方面会有什么影响我们习惯用每加仑的里程来阐述
en:Which one of these people has done more for the environment?See, you have a mental model.Fifty versus 35, that&#39;s a big move. Eleven versus nine? Come on.Turns out, go home and do the math,the nine to 11 is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons.Why? Because we don&#39;t care about miles per gallon, we care aboutgallons per mile.Think about how powerful that is if you&#39;re trying to encourage fuel efficiency.Miles per gallon is the way we present things.

zh-cn:如果想要改变消费者行为每英里耗油会有效的多研究人员发现了很多相似的情形再回到宝马 他们该怎么做?宝马面临的问题是 这车看上去很安全而这辆车 Mini Cooper 就没那么安全了宝马把下面这个绝妙的想法融入到广告宣传中一辆宝马在街道中行驶右边有辆火车 车上的箱子掉了下来宝马车迅速躲避 避免了车祸
en:If we want to encourage change of behavior,gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness.Researchers have found these type of anomalies.Okay, back to BMW. What should they do?The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe.This car, which is my Mini, doesn&#39;t look that safe.Here was BMW&#39;s brilliant insight, which they embodied into an ad campaign.They showed a BMW driving down the street.There&#39;s a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck.The car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn&#39;t get into an accident.
时间：12:03
zh-cn:宝马意识到 对消费者而言 安全性有两方面撞击时幸免于难可以说是安全的躲避事故也可以称之为安全相当成功的宣传 但请关注其中的深意它顺应了你们已有的观念即使我说服你去做某件事你最后也未必会付诸行动你们可能都想在差不多6点半或者7点起床这是我们每天面临的战斗去健身房锻炼也是一样这就是和睡眠挣扎的例子它告诉我们 愿望不应定能付诸行动所以其中的一个本质性问题就是我们怎样才会付诸行动
en:BWM realizes safety, in people&#39;s minds, has two components.You can be safe because when you&#39;re hit, you survive,or you can be safe because you avoid accidents.Remarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it.It harnesses something you already believe.Now, even if I persuaded you to do something,it&#39;s hard sometimes to actually get action as a result.You all probably intended to wake up,I don&#39;t know, 6:30, 7 a.m.This is a battle we all fight every day,along with trying to get to the gym.Now, this is an example of that battle,and makes us realize intentions don&#39;t always translate into action,and so one of the fundamental challengesis how we would actually do that. OK?

en:And you want to think about the social value of thatin terms of carbon offsets, reduced electricity,900 million dollars per year.Why? Because for free,this isn&#39;t a new technology, this is a letter —we&#39;re getting a Big Bang in behavior.So, how do we tackle the last mile?I think this tells us there is an opportunity.And I think to tackle it, we need to combinepsychology,marketing,art, we&#39;ve seen that.But you know what we need to combine it with?We need to combine this with the scientific method.

en:See what&#39;s really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me,is that the first 999 miles are all about science.No one would say, &quot;Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it.&quot;We have testing, we go to the lab, we try it again, we have refinement.But you know what we do on the last mile?&quot;Oh, this is a good idea.

en:Chris Anderson: Sendhil, thank you so much.So, this whole area is so fascinating.I mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economiststhat they are kind of putting into placeacademically, what great marketershave sort of intuitively known for a long time.How much is your field talking to great marketersabout their insights into human psychology?Because they&#39;ve seen it on the ground.

zh-cn:我们和营销员有很多交流60%的人跟你说的那样他们有很多观点值得我们什么深思40%的人想的是营销是什么营销就是向公司卖广告某种程度上来说 很多营销就是说服CEO这是个营销方案的有效性所以这有些蹊跷这还只是做到一半 跟真正的有效的营销方案还有一定的距离营销里面的一个新的课题就是 如何真正的评估有效性? 真的是有效的吗?
en:Sendhil Mullainathan: Yeah, we spend a lot of time talking to marketers,and I think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say,there are insights to be gleaned there.Forty percent of it is about what marketing is.Marketing is selling an ad to a firm.So, in some sense, a lot of marketing is aboutconvincing a CEO, &quot;This is a good ad campaign.&quot;So, there is a little bit of slippage there.That&#39;s just a caveat. That&#39;s different from actually having an effective ad campaign.And one of the new movements in marketing is: How do we actuallymeasure effectiveness? Are we effective?

zh-cn:我提到的科学方法很重要我们和那些有实力的公司以及有实力的非营利性组织紧密合作我们跟他们说 你要是想改变某种行为就先想出几个方案 进行测试看看哪些可行 再回头综合一下想想还有没有其他的点子再将这些想法和合作商的实力匹配这根其他方面的工作类似如果你想解决一个生物学问题先试着解决 如果可行 就扩大规模
en:SM: So, the scientific method I alluded to is pretty important.We work closely with companies that have operational capacity,or nonprofits that have operational capacity.And then we say, &quot;Well, you want to get this behavior change.Let&#39;s come up with a few ideas, test them,see which is working, go back, synthesize,and try to come up with a thing that works,&quot;and then we&#39;re able to scale with partners.It&#39;s kind of the model that has worked in other contexts.If you have biological problemswe try and fix it, see if it works, and then work the scale.
