zh-cn:你们都知道这个故事.在1950年的夏天,Enrico Fermi, 美籍意大利物理学家和原子堆创造者在Los Alamos国家实验室和一些同事们共进午餐,问他们一些问题:&quot;大家都在哪里?&quot;很显然,这句话把大家整蒙了.因为他们正跟他坐在一起.当时他不得不解释说他不是在跟他们讲话.他当时正和太空外星人讲话.
en:You all know this story.In the summer of 1950,Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicistand atomic-pile builder,went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratoryand joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:&quot;Where is everybody?&quot;This confused his colleagues, obviously,because they were sitting right there with him.And then he had to clarify that he wasn&#39;t talking about them.He was talking about the space aliens.

zh-cn:你看,这件事发生在新墨西哥州的罗斯威尔飞碟坠毁事件的几年之后.虽然结果是什么都没有,什么都没有—(笑声)仅仅是天上掉下来的一个气象气球,一个张着大嘴的秃子驾驶的气球.然而, 美国人已经对飞碟过敏了,即使是正在吃饭的著名科学家.Fermi的推论, 恕我诠释的不好,这宇宙是如此的宽广顺理成章会有其它睿智的生命存在于宇宙中.而且宇宙是如此的古老除非我们是第一个进化的文明,我们现在应该有一些外星人存在的证据.然而, 据我们所知, 我们是孤独的.
en:You see, this was only a few years afterthe supposed flying saucer crashat Roswell, New Mexico.And even though that turned out to be nothing,nothing at all —(Laughter) —merely a downed weather balloonpiloted by small hairless menwith slits for mouths ...Still, America had gone saucer-mad,even famous scientistswho were eating lunch.Fermi&#39;s reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,is that the universe is so vastthat it stands to reason,there should be other intelligent life out there.And the universe is so oldthat unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,we should have some evidence of their existence by now.And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.

zh-cn:&quot;大家都在哪里?&quot; Fermi问,他和他的同事都没法回答.Fermi之后就继续用这种愚笨的逻辑去反驳童话,还有大脚野人, 上帝,真爱的可能性—再后来, 你也知道,Enrico Fermi自此独自用餐.(笑声)现在,我不是一名科学家.我从来没创造过原子堆.虽然, 我很可能会争论,技术上讲.任何一个堆都是由原子构成的.
en:&quot;Where is everybody?&quot; asked Fermi,and his colleagues had no answer.Fermi then went on with the same blunt logicto disprove fairies,Sasquatch, God,the possibility of love —and thereafter, as you know,Enrico Fermi ate alone.(Laughter)Now,I am not a scientist.I have never built an atomic pile.Although, I might argue that, technically,every pile is atomic.

en:However, with respect, I might point out two possibilitiesthat Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.One is that the aliens might bevery far away.Perhaps, I dare say,even on other planets.The other possibility —(Laughter) —is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himselfwas an alien.

en:Think about it.Isn&#39;t it a little convenientthat in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,suddenly an Italian scientist showed upwith an amazing new technologythat would transform everything in the worldand darken the history of the human species forever after?And isn&#39;t it a little strangethat he required no payment for this?That he asked for only one thing —a gift of two healthy sperm whales?That&#39;s — that&#39;s not true.But it is strange.

en:And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,wouldn&#39;t he be the first to have tried to convincehis fellow scientiststhat the space aliens are not already here?For it is given in certain UFO-ologyor UFOlogy circles,that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;that they have walked among us in disguise,observing us, guiding our evolutionfrom ape to man —if you believe in that sort of thing —and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucersand taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.

en:For even in my own life,there are memories I havethat are difficult to explain —happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,that it is difficult to imaginethey were not the resultof prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.For how else will you explainthe amazing and absolutely trueclose encounters that I hadand will describe to you now?Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.This was the summer when the special edition of&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; was released.And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.

en:And so I spent the rest of the vacationlargely sitting outside our little rental house at night,the sidewalk still warm from the sun,watching the skies for UFOs.What did I see? Stars, satellites,blinking airplanes — typical sky junk.Occasionally, kids would come andjoin me and watch,but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalkto play video games and mingle with humans.I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,so I stayed alone with the cosmos.

en:And that&#39;s when it happened.An elderly couple came walking down the street.I would say they were in their late seventies,and I would say that they were on a date,because he was wearing a very neat little suitwith a yellow tie — a brown suit.And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully nightand a chill was coming in off the ocean.I remember, for some reason,that they were exactly the same height.And then they stopped, and the man turned to meand said,&quot;What are you looking for,flying saucers?&quot;

en:You have to admit, that&#39;s a pretty boss piece of detective workfor an old man on a date.But what was stranger still —and even I realized it at the time,as a nine-year-old child —was that they stopped at all.That this old man would interrupt his moonlight strollwith his sweetheart with the precise reasonof making fun of a child.&quot;Oh,&quot; he said,&quot;little green men.&quot;And then his girlfriend joined in, too.&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as space men,&quot; she said.&quot;There&#39;s no such thing.&quot;And then they both laughed. &quot;Ha, ha, ha.&quot;I looked around.The street was entirely empty.I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.It was as though time had stopped.I did not know why they were teasing me.I looked into their strangely angry faces,and I remember wondering,are they wearing rubber masks?

en:And what would be behind those rubber masks, if they were?Giant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes?Slits for mouths?The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun,and then he made laser sounds.&quot;Kew, kew, kew —watch out.&quot;And they turned at once and walked away.The old man reached outhis knobbly clawfor the woman&#39;s hand,and found it, and left me alone.Now, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding —a strange encounter among humans.Maybe it was swamp gas, but —(Laughter) —I know what I saw.

en:Close encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984.I went to see the movie &quot;Dune,&quot;and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face —(Laughter) —this is impossible on its face, I realize —but it is absolutely true.It was opening night, naturally.I went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.On my right was the girl in question.She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.I remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,an Ace bandage, and she had crutches.She was very tall, I would say.I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,but I had never seen her before. She didn&#39;t go to my school.I didn&#39;t know her name, and I never will.She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,and they were talking about the novel, &quot;Dune.&quot;They were both big fans, mother and daughter —very unusual.They were talking about how their favorite characterswere the giant sandworms.And then it got stranger.That&#39;s when she turned to me and said,&quot;Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?&quot;

en:(Laughter)But it was also the tone of how she asked the question:apropos of nothing, like she didn&#39;t even care about the answer,as though she just wanted to talk to me.I did not know what to say. I said, &quot;Yes.&quot;I did not even turn my head.The movie began.I need not remind you that this was David Lynch&#39;s version of &quot;Dune,&quot;in which all of the characterswere sexy and deformed at the same time.

en:When the movie ended,everyone seemed very happyto get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible.Except for the girl.As I walked out, her pace slowed.Perhaps it was the crutches,but it seemed —(Laughter) —it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.When I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous,but I can only come to the conclusionthat it was what, in the alien abductee community,they call a &quot;screen memory&quot;:a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brainto cover up some trauma — say, of being kidnappedand flown off to a sex pyramid.

en:Close encounter three: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,1989.In the mid-to-late &#39;80s,the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called &quot;Communion,&quot;in which he described his own lifelong experiencesbeing abducted by aliens.And he also described the phenomenon known in this communityas &quot;lost time,&quot;where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become awarethat he could not remember the previous ten minutes,or the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days.And would come to the conclusion that that was when the alienswere taking him and giving him rectal probes.

en:This book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.This image by Ted Joseph was from that book,and was his, sort of, police sketchof what the creatures looked likethat Whitley Strieber had described to him.And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.And in 1989, the way I remember it,I was in Philadelphiavisiting my girlfriend, and we decided,apropos of nothing, to go see this movie.And the way I remember it, the movie featured these details.One: Whitley Strieberwas played by Christopher Walken.Two: the alien was played by a rubber puppet.

en:Three: there was a surprisingly longsequence of the film in which the rubber puppetgives Christopher Walken a rectal probe.Four: this was being shownin a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia.Five: all of which is to say,they made a movie out of the book, &quot;Communion,&quot;and it starred Christopher Walken.Does something seem strange about this to you?Something odd?

en:How did this happen? When did this happen?I remember walking out of the theaterand becoming suddenly aware of this fact,as we walked hand in hand,and pondering these very same questions.And to this day, I have no answer for you.Close encounter four: the Algarve,Portugal, 1991.Some years later, I and this woman —we&#39;ll call her &quot;Catherine Fletcher&quot; —(Laughter) —went traveling through the south of Portugal together.We stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities,in tiny little hotels,and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verdeand watch the sun set and play checkers.What? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?We went to some topless beaches.Excuse me? No, not in my life.For what it&#39;s worth, we went to Sagres,which was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,and the lead dog bit me on the ass,requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinicand receive an ass shot.Make of that what you will.

en:Our last day in Portugal,we were in the district capital of Faro,and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beachone last time.Now, Faro is a bustling little city,and to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to takea bus and then a boat.And did I want to come with?But I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, &quot;No.&quot;I remember what she looked like before she left.The freckles had grownand multiplied on her face and shoulders,clustering into a kind of a tan.A tan, we were both tan —is this true?Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.She was smiling.She was a single woman about to go alone into a country,not even speaking the language,to travel alone by bus and boatto go to a beach she did not knowor had never seen.I loved her, and then she went outinto that strange, alien land.
时间：14:01
zh-cn:我重新整理了我的思绪.我有属于我的&quot;失忆时段&quot;,我突然醒了,意识到时间已经不早了,差不多到了晚饭时间,但她还没回来我感到不安,于是上街去找她.现在,我不会葡萄牙语.我也不知道沙滩在哪?我同样不能打电话给她因为那是1991年,那时外星人也没给我们这项技术.
en:It took me some time to come to my senses.I had my own &quot;lost time&quot; moment,where I woke up and suddenly realizedit was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,and she had not come back.Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her.Now, I did not speak Portuguese.I did not know where the beach was.I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,and the aliens had not given us that technology yet.

en:I realized that the day would only havetwo possible outcomes:either Catherine would come back to the hotel,or she would never come back to the hotel.And so I sat down to wait.I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the streetwhere the buses and cars and pedestriansand little scooters were moving along.And I watched those constellations shift,hoping that they would part and I would see her face.It was at that moment,in that very small town of 30,000 or so,that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universeand the searching we might do in it.And that&#39;s when the Liberians came along.Five young men — all laughing, happy, traveling together,coming back to this hotel where they were staying.

zh-cn:其中一个名叫Joseph,他问我我来做什么,我向他解释.他说,&quot;不要担心,&quot;他确信Catherine是安全的.但他看起来不太确信,因为他跟我一起坐下来.接下来的两个小时,他们和我一起等待.他们轮流来我房间讲笑话安慰我,分散我的注意力.两小时后,他们给我捎口信.我们并不孤独.
en:One of them was named Joseph, and he asked mewhat was I doing, and I explained.And he said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; He was sure that Catherine would be safe.But he did not seem so very sure,for he sat down to wait with me.And for the next two hours, they all waited with me:taking turns, going up to their room, coming back,telling me jokes, distracting me.Two hours, they gave me a message.We are not alone.
时间：15:33
zh-cn:这时,字里行间之中让人感到暮光的开始.我转过身来,看着街上.星星排成一排,她回来了.她笑着,她并不知道我为何而难过.利比里亚人也不理解,他们的笑声里有着很多的宽慰.他们在心底为我们鼓掌,默默回到房间让我们独自在街上,手牵手.这像记忆中的伤痛,被一个叫做&quot;葡萄牙的医生&quot;的人把一块外星人的高科技植入到你的臀部.
en:And then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,I turned and looked down the street.The stars aligned, and she came back.She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.Neither did the Liberians,although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughteras they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their roomand left us alone in the street, holding hands.An event like this leaves a scar on the memory,much like a piece of alien technologythat has been inserted into your buttocksby a &quot;Portuguese doctor.&quot;

en:And even now, a decade and a half later,even now that we are married,I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.And even though, I think you&#39;ll agree, it is probablethat during the time she was away,she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,I love her and wait for her still.
