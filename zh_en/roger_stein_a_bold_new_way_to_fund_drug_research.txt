zh-cn:这张照片是我和我爸爸在Far Rockaway的海滩上或叫Rockaway公园我是金头发的那个,那个拿着烟的是我爸爸那是在六十年代，很多人吸烟在二零零九年的夏天我爸被诊断出了肺癌癌症听上去让每个人难过如果你是一名美国男性在你的一生中，会有二分之一的机会被诊断出癌症如果你是一名女性，那么你有三分之一的机会被诊断是癌症每个人的身边都会有人被诊断出癌症
en:So this is a picture of my dad and meat the beach in Far Rockaway,or actually Rockaway Park.I&#39;m the one with the blond hair.My dad&#39;s the guy with the cigarette.It was the &#39;60s. A lot of people smoked back then.In the summer of 2009,my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.Cancer is one of those thingsthat actually touches everybody.If you&#39;re a man in the United States of the America,you&#39;ve got about a one in two chanceof being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime.If you&#39;re a woman, you&#39;ve gotabout a one in three chanceof being diagnosed with cancer.Everybody knows somebodywho&#39;s been diagnosed with cancer.

zh-cn:现在，我爸爸好了很多有一部分原因是他参与了一种新药的尝试那药是用特别配方做成的对他那种癌症很有效世界上有两百多种癌症那么我今天的主题就是为了帮助像我爸爸那些癌症患者,我们必须改变为癌症筹资的方式
en:Now, my dad&#39;s doing better today,and part of the reason for that is thathe was able to participate in the trialof an experimental new drugthat happened to be specially formulatedand very good for his particular kind of cancer.There are over 200 kinds of cancer.And what I want to talk about today ishow we can help more people like my dad,because we have to change the waywe think about raising moneyto fund cancer research.

zh-cn:在我爸爸被诊断出癌症后不久我和我的朋友Andrew Lo在一起喝咖啡他是MIT金融工程实验室的头我也是实验室的一员当时我们在谈论癌症Andrew一直在做各种研究有人告诉过他一个问题他也从文献中得知研究新药的过程中会遇到瓶颈导致研究新药非常困难而困难的原因在于新药研究的早期阶段研究药品投资风险大,而且十分昂贵Andrew问我是否想要和他合作在数学分析方面看看我们能做些什么
en:So a while after my dad was diagnosed,I was having coffee with my friend Andrew Lo.He&#39;s the head of the Laboratoryfor Financial Engineering at MIT,where I also have a position,and we were talking about cancer.And Andrew had been doinghis own bits of research,and one of the things that he had been toldand that he&#39;d learned from studying the literaturewas that there&#39;s actually a big bottleneck.It&#39;s very difficult to develop new drugs,and the reason it&#39;s difficult to develop new drugsis because in the early stages of drug development,the drugs are very risky,and they&#39;re very expensive.So Andrew asked me if I&#39;d want tomaybe work with him a bit,work on some of the math and the analyticsand see if we could figure outsomething we could do.

zh-cn:我不是一个科学家我不懂怎样制药我的合作者Andrew LoJose Maria Fernandez和David Fagnan所有人都不是科学家我们甚至不知道制药第一步该干什么但我们略知如何降低风险和一点儿金融工程,所以我们开始想，我们能干嘛呢我要告诉你们的是我们这几年做的工作从本质上改变了癌症研究和其他事物的做法我们想让研究促进筹资而不是资金赞助研究
en:Now I&#39;m not a scientist.You know, I don&#39;t know how to build a drug.And none of my coauthors, Andrew Loor Jose Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan —none of those guys — are scientists either.We don&#39;t know the first thing abouthow to make a cancer drug.But we know a little bit about risk mitigationand a little bit about financial engineering,and so we started thinking, what could we do?What I&#39;m going to tell you about is some workwe&#39;ve been doing over the last couple yearsthat we think could fundamentally change the wayresearch for cancer and lotsof other things gets done.We want to let the research drive the funding,not the other way around.

zh-cn:那么现在，我就告诉你们怎样让新药研究得到资助想象你在你的实验室里不像我，你是个科学家你发明了一种你认为能对某些癌症起作用的化合物那么下一步是在动物身上测试在试管里测试这里有一个贯例，是让这种药从实验室应用到临床为了让这种药从实验室应用到临床, 到病人,你必须测试药性测试药性需要进行一系列,大量的试验通过这些大量的试验,来确定药是否安全以及它是否有用等等所以美国食品和药物管理局有一套特定的标准在测试的第一阶段是测试药物的毒性被称作为第一阶段在第一阶段，把药分发给健康的人群来测试药物是否让他们生病换句话说，如果副作用大于药品有效性, 不管药多好,也不值得研发药物是否会引起人们的心脏病发作，让人死亡，肝功能衰竭，诸如此类结果表明，这一阶级是一个巨大的障碍三分之一的药物在此阶段被淘汰下一阶段，是测试药物有效性这一阶段是给那些罹患癌症的病人服用此药,看疗效如何这又是一个巨大障碍，很多病人不愿参与在第三阶段, 把药用于大量人群来确定用药量，同时和现有药品有效性做比较,如果不如意,干嘛要生产它当完成了所有步骤,只有一小部分药物通过了测试所以，就只有这些蓝瓶的能救人他们价值几十亿有时候甚至每年几十亿问题出来了如果我问你，例如做一次性的投资两亿美元买其中的一瓶药初始投资两亿，一次性买其中一瓶我不会告诉你是哪一瓶十年后，我会告诉你,你买的是否是蓝瓶的.对大家来说，这听上去划算吗？不是，对吧而事实上这是一种风险很大的投资这就是药物研究很难得到资助的原因但是就概算来说这确实是这个提议你必须从早期开始投资而且花很长的时间
en:So in order to get started, let me tell youhow you get a drug financed.Imagine that you&#39;re in your lab —you&#39;re a scientist, you&#39;re not like me —you&#39;re a scientist, and you&#39;ve developeda new compound that you think might betherapeutic for somebody with cancer.Well, what you do is, you test in animals,you test in test tubes,but there&#39;s this notion of going from the benchto the bedside,and in order to get from the bench, the lab,to the bedside, to the patients,you&#39;ve got to get the drug tested.And the way the drug gets tested is through a seriesof, basically, experiments,through these large, they&#39;re called trials,that they do to determine whether the drug is safeand whether it works and all these things.So the FDA has a very specific protocol.In the first phase of this testing,which is called testing for toxicity,it&#39;s called Phase I.In the first phase, you givethe drug to healthy peopleand you see if it actually makes them sick.In other words, are the side effects just so severethat no matter how much good it does,it&#39;s not going to be worth it?Does it cause heart attacks, kill people,liver failure, this kind of thing?And it turns out, that&#39;s a pretty high hurdle.About a third of all drugs drop out at that point.In the next phase, you testto see if the drug&#39;s effective,and what you do there is yougive it to people with cancerand you see if it actually makes them better.And that&#39;s also a higher hurdle. People drop out.And in the third phase, you actuallytest it on a very large sample,and what you&#39;re trying to determineis what the right dose is, and also,is it better than what&#39;s available today?If not, then why build it?When you&#39;re done with all that,what you have is a very small percentage of drugsthat start the process actuallycome out the other side.So those blue bottles, those blue bottles save lives,and they&#39;re also worth billions,sometimes billions a year.So now here&#39;s a question:if I were to ask you, for example,to make a one-time investment of, say,200 million dollarsto buy one of those bottles,so 200 million dollars up front, one time,to buy one of those bottles,I won&#39;t tell you which one it is,and in 10 years, I&#39;ll tell you whetheryou have one of the blue ones.Does that sound like a good deal for anybody?No. No, right?And of course, it&#39;s a very, very risky trial position,and that&#39;s why it&#39;s very hard to get funding,but to a first approximation,that&#39;s actually the proposal.You have to fund these thingsfrom the early stages on. It takes a long time.

zh-cn:所以Andrew对我说“如果我们不把这种产品当做药物来看呢？”如果我们把这种投资当做是其他的金融资产来看待他们只是有一个很反常的收益结构而已那么利用我们知道的所有关于金融工程的知识,通过市场交易的计巧,把研发这些药物视作金融产物
en:So Andrew said to me, he said,&quot;What if we stop thinking about these as drugs?What if we start thinking aboutthem as financial assets?&quot;They&#39;ve got really weird payoffstructures and all that,but let&#39;s throw everything we knowabout financial engineering at them.Let&#39;s see if we can use all the tricks of the tradeto figure out how to make these drugswork as financial assets?
时间： 5:09
zh-cn:我们先创建一个巨额基金在金融界，我们知道怎样处理高风险资产:把它们放在投资组合中试着增加平稳的回报我们做了一些数学分析，结果可行, 但是真正运作起来,需要八十到一百五十种新药
en:Let&#39;s create a giant fund.In finance, we know what to dowith assets that are risky.You put them in a portfolioand you try to smooth out the returns.So we did some math, and it turned outyou could make this work,but in order to make it work,you need about 80 to 150 drugs.
时间： 5:23
zh-cn:但是现在有个好消息，市面上有大量新药等待测试我们被告知大概有积压了20年的药品等着被测试但是沒有得到资金事实上，初始阶段的筹资,如第一阶段和临床前测试,在这个行业里被称为&quot;死亡之谷&quot;因为这些阶段就是药物被淘汱的主要时期对新药来说很难通过这些阶段当然，如果不能通过这些阶段，也就不能进入下一阶段
en:Now the good news is, there&#39;s plenty of drugsthat are waiting to be tested.We&#39;ve been told that there&#39;s a backlogof about 20 years of drugsthat are waiting to be tested but can&#39;t be funded.In fact, that early stage of the funding process,that Phase I and pre-clinical stuff,that&#39;s actually, in the industry, called the Valley of Deathbecause it&#39;s where drugs go to die.It&#39;s very hard to for them to get through there,and of course, if you can&#39;t get through there,you can&#39;t get to the later stages.
时间： 5:47
zh-cn:所以我们做了数学分析，我们发现,需要八十到一百五十种新药,或者类似那样的东西，然后我们做了进一步分析,大概需要融资三十亿到一百五十亿所以我们又从一个怪圈跳进另一个怪圈我们可以解决风险问题，但是我们现在需要大量资金只有一个地方可以获得如此多的资金即&quot;资本市场&quot;风险投资家没有那么多资金，慈善家也没有我们得想办法让那些在金融市场中通常不热衷投资此类项目的人们甘愿对此进行投资再一次金融工程起到很大作用想象一下, 这个宠大的基金本身并无价值,它做的只是发售债券和股票,来产生现金流量当有了现金以后，买进所需的药物投资组合然后药物就可以如期通过测试阶段,每一次他们抵达下一阶段他们的价值得到提升大部分做不到只有少数能做到那些增值的药物可以出售,此时,获得的利润可以付利息,而且有余钱进行下一阶段的测试几乎是财政自给.如此循环下去,当一切完成了，清算这组投资组合,清偿债务, 发放股息,给了股东很好的收益
en:So we did this math, and we figured out, okay,well, you know, you need about 80 to, say, 150,or something like that, drugs.And then we did a little more math, and we said,okay, well that&#39;s a fund of aboutthree to 15 billion dollars.So we kind of created a new problemby solving the old one.We were able to get rid of the risk,but now we need a lot of capital,and there&#39;s only one place to get that kind of capital,the capital markets.Venture capitalists don&#39;t have it.Philanthropies don&#39;t have it.But we have to figure out how we canget people in the capital markets,who traditionally don&#39;t invest in this stuff,to want to invest in this stuff.So again, financial engineering was helpful here.Imagine the megafund actually starts empty,and what it does is it issues some debtand some equity,and that generates cash flow.That cash flow is used, then, to buythat big portfolio of drugs that you need,and those drugs start working their waythrough that approval process,and each time they go througha next phase of approval,they gain value.And most of them don&#39;t make it,but a few of them do,and with the ones that gain value, you can sell some,and when you sell them,you have money to pay the interest on those bonds,but you also have money tofund the next round of trials.It&#39;s almost self-funding.You do that for the course of the transaction,and when you&#39;re done, you liquidate the portfolio,pay back the bonds, and you cangive the equity holders a nice return.
时间： 6:59
zh-cn:但那只是个理论,我们也谈论了一段时间,做了一些实验,我们很想把它付诸于实际我们用了两年时间做市场调研,我们的团队和上百个药物金融和风险投资的专家谈过我们和发明药物的科学家谈过我们也和药物公司谈过实际上我们研究了药物的数据超过两千种被通过或淘汰或放弃的我们进行了几百万的数据模拟当然花费了大量时间当我们完成时,我们发现结果令人吃惊,实际上我们的想法是可行的这个基金模式能产生出低风险的债券对于债券持有者来说很有吸引力投资收益在百分之五到八对于股票，股东可获得百分之十二的投资收益但是对风险投资者来说回报还不够风险投资者是那些压的赌注很大并且得到几十亿回报的人但结果表明，仍然有很多人对药物投资兴趣浓厚对退休基金和退休福利计划来说以及其他这是最佳的投资计划
en:So that was the theory, and we talked about itfor a bit, we did a bunch of experiments,and then we said, let&#39;s really try to test it.We spent the next two years doing research.We talked to hundreds of experts in drug financingand venture capital.We talked to people who have developed drugs.We talked to pharmaceutical companies.We actually looked at the data for drugs,over 2,000 drugs that had been approved or deniedor withdrawn,and we also ran millions of simulations.And all that actually took a lot of time.But when we were done, what we found was something that was sort of surprising.It was actually feasible to structure that fundsuch that when you were done structuring it,you could actually produce low-risk bondsthat would be attractive to bond holders,that would give you yields ofabout five to eight percent,and you could produce equitythat would give equity holdersabout a 12-percent return.Now those returns aren&#39;t going to be attractiveto a venture capitalist.Venture capitalists are those guyswho want to make those big betsand get those billion dollar payoffs.But it turns out, there are lots of other folksthat would be interested in that.That&#39;s right in the investment sweet spotof pension funds and 401(k) plansand all this other stuff.

zh-cn:因此我们在学术刊物上发表了一些文章在医学期刊上发表文章在财经期刊上发表文章但是直到在一些主流媒体上发表了相关文章,我们才真正开始得到一些关注
en:So we published some articlesin the academic press.We published articles in medical journals.We published articles in finance journals.But it wasn&#39;t until we actuallygot the popular press interested in thisthat we began to get some traction.
时间： 8:18
zh-cn:我们不只是想让人们意识到此问题,而且想让人们参与到其中所以我们把编程的计算机代码放在了网上我们申请了开放源代码的许可这样大家就都能使用了大家现在就可以下载来试试看这个模型是否可行实际上它很有帮助，因为试用的人们也许不相信我们的假设但现在可以自己测验它的可行性
en:We wanted to do something more thanjust make people aware of it, though.We wanted people to get involved.So what we did was, we actuallytook all of our computer codeand made that available onlineunder an open-source licenseto anybody that wanted it.And you guys can download it todayif you want to run your own experimentsto see if this would work.And that was really effective, because peoplethat didn&#39;t believe our assumptionscould try their own assumptionsand see how it would work.
时间： 8:39
zh-cn:现在有一个显著的问题，那就是世界上有那么多钱来资助这些项目吗我们已经知道我们有足够多的试验药物但是有足够的钱吗我们有一百兆的资金现在存在于固定收益证券中那可以是一百兆啊太多钱了笑声
en:Now there&#39;s an obvious problem, which is,is there enough money inthe world to fund this stuff?I&#39;ve told you there&#39;s enough drugs,but is there enough money?There&#39;s 100 trillion dollars of capitalcurrently invested in fixed-income securities.That&#39;s a hundred thousand billion.There&#39;s plenty of money.(Laughter)
时间： 9:02
zh-cn:但是我们意识到需要的不仅仅是钱我们必须让大家有信心来参与进来大家也必须要懂得相关知识所以我们开始思考可能会出错的地方在做的过程中会遇到什么挑战我们列了一张很长的单子其中囊括很多人，包括我们自己细化可能出现的问题我们提出，能不能在信贷危机方面开展工作？能不能在监管调控下展开工作？能不能同时处理很多项目?我们的专家在一起合计并且分管不同工作在今年夏天我们开了一个会是一个只有邀请者才可参与的会议会议是由美国癌症协会赞助的由国家癌症学会协办我们汇集了各方精英，包括政府和那些研究中心负责人等等,整整两天，我们坐在一起听取对五种工作研究的报告他们还做了进一步探讨.这是第一次让这件事情成真的人们坐在一起讨论可行性
en:But what we realized was that it&#39;smore than just money that&#39;s required.We had to get people motivated,people to get involved,and people had to understand this.And so we started thinking about all the different things that could go wrong.What are all the challenges to doing this that might get in the way?And we had a long list, and so what we did waswe assigned a bunch of people, including ourselves,different pieces of this problem,and we said, could you starta work stream on credit risk?Could you start a work streamon the regulatory aspects?Could you start a work stream onhow you would actually manage so many projects?And we had all these experts get togetherand do these different work streams,and then we held a conference.The conference was held overthe summer, this past summer.It was an invitation-only conference.It was sponsored by the American Cancer Societyand done in collaborationwith the National Cancer Institute.And we had experts from every fieldthat we thought would be important,including the government, includingpeople that run research centers and so on,and for two days they sat aroundand heard the reportsfrom those five work streams,and they talked about it.It was the first timethat the people who could actually make this happensat across the table from each otherand had these conversations.

zh-cn:会后有个常规晚宴在晚宴上我们彼此了解,就像我们现在在这儿一样我恰好看了看窗外我是很真诚地说这番话，在晚宴当天我看了窗外，那还是夏天我看到了叠虹我想那是个好兆头
en:Now these conferences, it&#39;s typical to have a dinner,and at that dinner,you kind of get to know each other,sort of like what we&#39;re doing here.I happened to look out the window,and hand on my heart, I looked out the windowon the night of this conference —it was the summertime —and that&#39;s what I saw, it was a double rainbow.So I&#39;d like to think it was a good sign.
时间：10:23
zh-cn:自从那次会议以后，在巴黎和旧金山的专家们开始一起合作很多人一起研究这个项目看是否会成真我们不是在拉赞助但是我们希望别人能这样做因为，再次重申，我不是科学家我不会制药我也没有那么多钱去资助哪怕只是其中一个试验但是我们在一起合作，用我们的养老金计划用我们的529个方案，用我们的退休金我们大概能赞助几百个试验也能收到很好回报然后拯救像我爸那样的许多病人
en:Since the conference, we&#39;ve got people workingbetween Paris and San Francisco,lots of different folks working on thisto try to see if we can really make it happen.We&#39;re not looking to start a fund,but we want somebody else to do this.Because, again, I&#39;m not a scientist.I can&#39;t build a drug.I&#39;m never going to have enough moneyto fund even one of those trials.But all of us together, with our 401(k)&#39;s,with our 529 plans, with our pension plans,all of us together can actually fund hundreds of trialsand get paid well for doing itand save millions of lives like my dad.
