zh-cn:有一件事定义了TED的参与者那就是你充满激情并且你有条不紊地进行管理你确实对你关心的问题付出很多但你会发现你需要选举委员会让你的议题脱颖而出那么你如何做到呢？
en:One of the things thatdefines a TEDsteris you&#39;ve taken your passion,and you&#39;ve turned it into stewardship.You actually put action to the issues you care about.But what you&#39;re going to find eventually isyou may need to actually get elected officialsto help you out.So, how do you do that?

zh-cn:我可以告诉你一件事我曾在探索发现频道工作过一段时间那段经历扭转了我的思维框架所以当你一想到政客你必须意识到他们是奇怪的生物而不仅仅是他们没有方向感而且他们的觅食习性很奇怪究竟你该如何和他们相处。我们需要知道的是：是什么驱动着政治的生物在政客心中有两个基本的信条第一条声望和影响这些是最主要的工具被政客用来做他的工作第二条，不象其他动物，大都是种群的幸存者这是自我保护也许你现在觉得金钱是关键但那其实只是一个代理诱惑我自己去做
en:One of the things I should probably tell you is,I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,and that sort of warped my framework.So, when you start to think about politicians,you&#39;ve got to realize these are strange creatures.Other than the fact that they can&#39;t tell directions,and they have very strange breeding habits,how do you actually work with these things? (Laughter)What we need to understand is:What drives the political creature?And there are two things that are primary in a politician&#39;s heart:One is reputation and influence.These are the primary tools by whicha politician can do his job.The second one — unlike most animals,which is survival of the species —this is preservation of self.Now you may think it&#39;s money,but that&#39;s actually sort of a proxyto what I can do to preserve myself.

zh-cn:现在，是向前推动这个问题的时候了这些动物整天被报道到底什么是没用的，而哪些方法又能使你的问题得到重视你可以向他们发电子邮件然而，非常不幸，我总是收到太多伟哥广告你的电子邮件丢失了没关系，当作垃圾邮件那么打电话行么好吧，往往都是面对一个机器人说话是的，他们回电话了，可他们说不喜欢这个想法打电话行不通面对面也许有用但这实在太难安排了往往很难得到有效的回应和沟通是的，捐款的确可以得到回报并且是很好的讨论话题，但这仍需一些时日的积累。
en:Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forwardis these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.So, what doesn&#39;t work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?You can send them an email.Well, unfortunately, I&#39;ve got so manyViagra ads coming at me,your email is lost.It doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s spam.How about you get on the phone?Well, chances are I&#39;ve got a droid who&#39;s picking up the phone,&quot;Yes, they called, and they said they didn&#39;t like it.&quot;That doesn&#39;t move.Face to face would work,but it&#39;s hard to set it up.It&#39;s hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.Yes, contributions actually do make a differenceand they set a context for having a conversation,but it takes some time to build up.

zh-cn:那么到底什么最有效呢答案也许相当匪夷所思这就是写信我们生活在一个数码时代但我们依然是很模式化的生物信件仍然很有用即使我们总统本人也会每天阅读十封信由工作人员帮忙选出来我可以告诉大家在我工作过的每一个行政机关都会告诉你他们收到过的信和他们的意义所以你为什么不写封信呢首先，你要找一个传统的设备──钢笔我知道你会经历一段困难时期去适应如何正确握笔但这真的是非常重要的最重要的是你要亲笔写这封信这简直太少见了有人竟然拿起这个古老工具写信给我其次，我将给你们推荐如何使用一种积极的姿态每月至少给机关负责人写一封信在这儿我向你保证如果你坚持这么做不到三个月相关单位会开始给你打电话一旦有关问题发生的时候，会问你，“您是怎么看这个问题的”
en:So what actually works?And the answer is rather strange.It&#39;s a letter.We live in a digital world,but we&#39;re fairly analog creatures.Letters actually work.Even the top dog himselftakes time every day to read 10 lettersthat are picked out by staff.I can tell you that every official that I&#39;ve ever worked withwill tell you about the letters they getand what they mean.So, how are you going to write your letter?First of all, you&#39;re going to pick up an analog device: a pen.I know these are tough, and you may have a hard timegetting your hand bent around it, (Laughter)but this is actually critical.And it is critical thatyou actually handwrite your letter.It is so novel to see this,that somebody actually picked up an analog deviceand has written to me.Second of all, I&#39;m going to recommend thatyou get into a proactive stanceand write to your elected officials at least once a month.Here&#39;s my promise to you:If you are consistent and do this,within three months the elected official will start calling youwhen that issue comes up and say, &quot;What do you think?&quot;

zh-cn:现在，我将建议你采用以下格式写信使用四段落结构当你接近这些动物的时候你需要知道接近他们的危险性你又必须接近他们带一定的尊敬和一点点的谨慎所以在第一段我给你的建议非常简单奉承他们你也许并不欣赏对方个人，你也不喜欢他们任何其他东西但你可以恭维他们有一份苦差事当动物想要得到什么，他们就去得到它他们不会花时间来回徘徊所以你的机会来了第二段实际上你可以单刀直入表明你心中的立场当你这么做的时候不要攻击任何人要对事不对人人身攻击会让你失去回旋余地第三段当动物受到攻击或威胁时他们会誓死反抗所以你要给他们一个出口大部分时间，如果他们发现了一条退路，他们会选择全身而退显然你很高明一旦你拥有正确的情报你将做出正确的决定然后你想成为培训专家你成为了可以投靠的安全地带所以在第四段你将告诉人们”如果没人向你们提供这些信息，我来帮你“
en:Now, I&#39;m going to give youa four paragraph format to work with.Now, when you approach these animals,you need to understand there&#39;s a dangerous end to them,and you also need to approach themwith some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.So in paragraph number one,what I&#39;m going to tell you to do is very simply this:You appreciate them.You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,but maybe you appreciate the fact that they&#39;ve got a tough gig.When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.They don&#39;t spend a lot of time dicking around.So, here you go. (Laughter)Paragraph number two:You may actually have to just get very bluntand say what&#39;s really on your mind.When you do this,don&#39;t attack people;you attack tactics.Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.Paragraph number three:When animals are attacked or cornered,they will fight to the death,so you have to give them an exit.Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.&quot;Obviously, you&#39;re intelligent.If you had the right information,you would have done the right thing.&quot; (Laughter)Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.You&#39;re the safe place to come in to.So, in paragraph number four,you&#39;re going to tell people,&quot;If no one is providing you with this information, let me help.&quot; (Laughter)

zh-cn:动物很喜欢炫耀，他们只干两件事警告你或者试图攻击你然后说：“求合体”你将通过签署这封信署名的时候告诉他们你做过的一些项目，你是一个副主管你是志愿者，你做过的一些其他事为什么这很重要因为这表明了两点政治动物最主要的评判标准那就是你有大的影响力还有我的政绩要依靠你
en:Animals do displays. They do two things:They warn you or they try to attract youand say, &quot;We need to mate.&quot;You&#39;re going to do that by the way you sign your letter.You do a number of things: you&#39;re a vice president,you volunteer, you do something else.Why is is this important?Because this establishes the twoprimary criteria for the political creature:that you have influence in a large sphere,and that my preservation depends on you.

zh-cn:这里有你个很有用的小技巧特别对于台下TED的听众你应该这样寄你的亲笔信首先，你把原件寄到本地邮局然后你再寄一份附件到邮政总局如果你这么做，他们将打电话问：“你是否有原件？”那样一些工作人员会在信贴上一些标签写到”哦，这是封重要的信件“你的信就这样进入了正式的文件夹然后有关领导必须仔细读这封信了
en:Here is one very quick hack,especially for the feds in the audience.Here&#39;s how you mail your letter.First of all, you send the original to the district office.So, you send the copy to the main office.If they follow protocol, they&#39;ll pick up the phone and say, &quot;Hey, do you have the original?&quot;Then some droid in the back puts the name on a ticklerand says, &quot;Oh, this is an important letter.&quot;And you actually get into the folderthat the elected official actually has to read.

zh-cn:那么你的信意味着什么呢我必须告诉你，我们都在一个派对中而政客是彩罐（观众笑声）我们听他们长篇大论被买卖，被推销但是书信是少数几次可以真诚交流的机会我第一次被选为人大代表是时，我收到了这封信我一直带着它参加每一场咨询会这是一次真实对话的机会而如果你有这个台阶并想要沟通那这个对话将非常重要所以一旦你这么去做了，我保证你将会成为丛林中的大猩猩
en:So, what your letter means:I&#39;ve got to tell you, we are all in a party,and political officials are the pinatas.(Laughter)We are harangued, lectured to,sold, marketed,but a letter is actually one of the few timesthat we have honest communication.I got this letter when I was first elected,and I still carry it toevery council meeting I go to.This is an opportunity at real dialogue,and if you have stewardshipand want to communicate,that dialogue is incredibly powerful.So when you do that, here&#39;s what I can promise:You&#39;re going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.
