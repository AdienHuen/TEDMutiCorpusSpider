zh-cn:匿名：亲爱的福克斯新闻很不幸得引起了我们的注意所有匿名者的名称和性质已经被破坏我们无所不在我们没有姓名，我们代表着大众我们不会原谅 我们不会遗忘我们只是混乱的根源
en:Anonymous: Dear Fox News,it has come to our unfortunate attentionthat both the name and nature of Anonymoushas been ravaged.We are everyone. We are no one.We are anonymous. We are legion.We do not forgive. We do not forget.We are but the base of chaos.

zh-cn:美莎·格伦尼：匿名者，女士们先生们—一个老练的有政治动机的黑客团体出现于2011年他们非常可怕你不会知道他们下次什么时候发动攻击谁是受害者或后果是什么可有趣的是他们很有幽默感他们盗取福克斯新闻的推特帐号并宣布奥巴马总统被暗杀你可以想象当时在福克斯新闻编辑室内有多么的恐慌“我们现在该怎么办？是该臂缠黑纱，还是开香槟庆祝？”（笑声）当然，谁又能逃避默多克新闻集团的一员竟成为了黑客的受害者这么具有讽刺意味的转变
en:Misha Glenny: Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen —a sophisticated groupof politically motivated hackerswho have emerged in 2011.And they&#39;re pretty scary.You never know when they&#39;re going to attack next,who or what the consequences will be.But interestingly,they have a sense of humor.These guys hacked into Fox News&#39; Twitter accountto announce President Obama&#39;s assassination.Now you can imagine the panic that would have generatedin the newsroom at Fox.&quot;What do we do now?Put on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?&quot;(Laughter)And of course, who could escape the ironyof a member of Rupert Murdoch&#39;s News Corp.being a victim of hacking for a change.

zh-cn:有时你打开新闻节目你会说“还有谁没被黑吗？”索尼游戏平台网络—被侵入土耳其政府—被侵入英国严重有组织犯罪署—易如反掌美国中央情报局—轻而易举被侵入事实上，我的一位安保行业的朋友不久前告诉我世界上有两种公司：已知被侵入的和还不知道已被侵入的我知道有三家为美国联邦调查局提供网络安全服务的公司已经被侵入了天啊，难道已经没有什么是不可侵入的了吗？
en:Sometimes you turn on the newsand you say, &quot;Is there anyone left to hack?&quot;Sony Playstation Network — done,the government of Turkey — tick,Britain&#39;s Serious Organized Crime Agency — a breeze,the CIA — falling off a log.In fact, a friend of mine from the security industrytold me the other daythat there are two types of companies in the world:those that know they&#39;ve been hacked, and those that don&#39;t.I mean three companiesproviding cybersecurity services to the FBIhave been hacked.Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven&#39;s sake?

zh-cn:总之，这个神秘的匿名组织—他们自己这么称呼自己—他们提供一种服务来证明企业在保护我们的数据上是多么的没用但对于匿名者还是有一个非常严重方面—他们是基于意识形态的他们声称他们正在和卑鄙的阴谋集团斗争他们说政府正试图接管网络并加以控制同时他们，匿名者们才是反抗的可信的声音—他们反对中东独裁者反对全球媒体或是反对情报机构或是其他等等他们的政治理念并不是完全没有吸引力好，他们只是刚刚开始他们大力鼓吹还不成熟的无政府主义但有一个事实我们正处在控制网络这场强势斗争的初始阶段网络连接着一切且不久的将来大多数人类活动都离不开网络因为网络已经为旧时代的进退两难塑造了一个全新的复杂环境使得对安全的需求添加了对于自由的渴望
en:Anyway, this mysterious group Anonymous —and they would say this themselves —they are providing a serviceby demonstrating how useless companies areat protecting our data.But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous —they are ideologically driven.They claim that they are battlinga dastardly conspiracy.They say that governments are tryingto take over the Internet and control it,and that they, Anonymous,are the authentic voice of resistance —be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships,against global media corporations,or against intelligence agencies,or whoever it is.And their politics are not entirely unattractive.Okay, they&#39;re a little inchoate.There&#39;s a strong whiffof half-baked anarchism about them.But one thing is true:we are at the beginningof a mighty strugglefor control of the Internet.The Web links everything,and very soonit will mediate most human activity.Because the Internet has fashioneda new and complicated environmentfor an old-age dilemmathat pits the demands of securitywith the desire for freedom.

zh-cn:如今这是个非常复杂的斗争遗憾的是，对于像你我一样的凡人也许不会对此了解很多尽管如此在数年前一次意外的狂妄的攻击下我决定试着去做些事情我获得了些成果这些是我之前试着去弄懂的不同的事情但为了解释清整件事情我需要再一个18分钟所以在这种情况下你要对我信任我向大家保证所有的这些事情都与网络安全和对网络的控制多多少少有关系但是即使是史蒂夫·霍金都有困难去转动他的头部所有就在那就像大家看到的，在中间有一位我们的老朋友， 黑客黑客在许多政治、社会以及经济事件中都处于绝对重要的位置所以我心想“好，他们就是我要聊聊的家伙”你知道吗没有其他人真正跟黑客交流过他们完全是匿名的
en:Now this is a very complicated struggle.And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me,we probably can&#39;t understand it very well.Nonetheless,in an unexpected attack of hubrisa couple of years ago,I decided I would try and do that.And I sort of get it.These were the various things that I was looking atas I was trying to understand it.But in order to try and explain the whole thing,I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it,so you&#39;re just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion,and let me assure you that all of these issuesare involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internetone way or the other,but in a configurationthat even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficultytrying to get his head around.So there you are.And as you see, in the middle,there is our old friend, the hacker.The hacker is absolutely centralto many of the political, socialand economic issues affecting the Net.And so I thought to myself,&quot;Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to.&quot;And what do you know,nobody else does talk to the hackers.They&#39;re completely anonymous, as it were.

zh-cn:尽管现实中我们开始花费了数十亿数千亿美元在网络安全上—花费在那些最出色的技术解决方案上—却没有人希望和那些从事各行各业的黑客们聊聊反之，他们更青睐于这些着实让人眼花缭乱且成本巨大的解决方案上从没人试着走近黑客的生活我说的是没有人但事实上，还是有一个非常小的研究机构在意大利都灵叫做黑客分析项目他们从事着非常棒的研究关于黑客特征才能和社会化方面但因为他们是联合国运作的所以政府和企业对他们兴趣不大因为联合国的项目当然，就缺乏资金但是我认为他们正做着非常重要的工作因为在网络安全行业其实是科技过剩的我们实际缺乏的是—你可以说我是保守派—人类的智慧
en:So despite the factthat we are beginning to pour billions,hundreds of billions of dollars,into cybersecurity —for the most extraordinary technical solutions —no one wants to talkto these guys, the hackers,who are doing everything.Instead, we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions,which cost a huge amount of money.And so nothing is going into the hackers.Well, I say nothing,but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unitin Turin, Italycalled the Hackers Profiling Project.And they are doing some fantastic researchinto the characteristics,into the abilitiesand the socialization of hackers.But because they&#39;re a U.N. operation,maybe that&#39;s why governments and corporationsare not that interested in them.Because it&#39;s a U.N. operation,of course, it lacks funding.But I think they&#39;re doing very important work.Because where we have a surplus of technologyin the cybersecurity industry,we have a definite lack of —call me old-fashioned —human intelligence.

zh-cn:我到现在为止所提到的匿名的黑客都是政治导向型的黑客组织当然，刑事司法系统把它们视为犯罪分子但有趣的是匿名者从来不用他们所盗取的信息进行营利但是真正的网络罪犯又是怎样的呢？真正的有组织网络犯罪要追溯到10年前当乌克兰一个天才黑客组织开发了一个网站形成了网络犯罪的产业化欢迎来到已经被遗忘的了CarderPlanet王国10年前在网络上他们就是这样宣传自己的现在CarderPlanet变得非常有趣网络罪犯们登录网站去买卖盗来的信用卡信息来换取新的恶意软件的信息记住，这是第一次我们看到所谓现成的恶意软件这已经是成品了，即装即用即使你不是一个资深的黑客 你照样可以应用
en:Now, so far I&#39;ve mentionedthe hackers Anonymouswho are a politically motivated hacking group.Of course, the criminal justice systemtreats them as common old garden criminals.But interestingly,Anonymous does not make use of its hacked informationfor financial gain.But what about the real cybercriminals?Well real organized crime on the Internetgoes back about 10 yearswhen a group of gifted Ukrainian hackersdeveloped a website,which led to the industrializationof cybercrime.Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet.This is how they were advertising themselvesa decade ago on the Net.Now CarderPlanet was very interesting.Cybercriminals would go thereto buy and sell stolen credit card details,to exchange informationabout new malware that was out there.And remember, this is a timewhen we&#39;re seeing for the first timeso-called off-the-shelf malware.This is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff,which you can deployeven if you&#39;re not a terribly sophisticated hacker.
时间： 7:45
zh-cn:于是CarderPlanet成为了一个有点像网络罪犯超市的地方它的创造者非常聪明且有企业家头脑因为他们作为网络罪犯面临着一个巨大的挑战这个挑战是：如何去经营你怎么去信任在网络上你想与之交易的人当你明知他们就是罪犯的时候？（笑声）不说也知道他们都很狡猾而且试图诈骗你CarderPlanet 的内部核心人员对此很清楚于是想出了个很棒的点子叫做托管系统他们任命一位职员负责在买卖双方进行协调卖方说，有一个盗来的信用卡信息买方如果希望买需要把出价发给管理员同时卖方把盗来的信用卡信息发给管理员管理员然后进行核实看看信用卡信息是否有效如果真实有效他就会把钱转给卖方同时把信用卡信息转给买方这是网络犯罪彻底的变革从那之后，网络犯罪变的肆无忌惮对于那些我们称之为Carders的人拥有那黄金十年
en:And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarketfor cybercriminals.And its creatorswere incredibly smart and entrepreneurial,because they were facedwith one enormous challenge as cybercriminals.And that challenge is:How do you do business,how do you trustsomebody on the Web who you want to do business withwhen you know that they&#39;re a criminal?(Laughter)It&#39;s axiomatic that they&#39;re dodgy,and they&#39;re going to want to try and rip you off.So the family, as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known,came up with this brilliant ideacalled the escrow system.They appointed an officerwho would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.The vendor, say, had stolen credit card details;the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them.The purchaser would send the administrative officersome dollars digitally,and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details.And the officer would then verifyif the stolen credit card worked.And if they did,he then passed on the money to the vendorand the stolen credit card details to the purchaser.And it was thiswhich completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web.And after that, it just went wild.We had a champagne decadefor people who we know as Carders.

zh-cn:现在我和他们之中一员交谈我们叫他红军 —虽然那绰号不完全适合他—但是我许诺了不会说出他的身份他还向我解释了他是如何在2003和2004年在纽约狂欢的时候用复制的假信用卡从一台ATM机上取出1万美元另一台上取出3万美元他平均每周盗取15万美元—当然是免税的他还说他有很多钱藏匿在上东侧的公寓内他都不知道用这些钱干什么事实上还很沮丧现在形势不同了我不会去做了现在关于红军有趣的是他并不是一个高级的黑客他略懂技术同时意识到安全非常重要如果你想成为Carder的一员但是他不会日以继夜干着在电脑前工作，吃着批萨喝着可乐之类的事情他在一个镇上享受着高质量生活
en:Now I spoke to one of these Carderswho we&#39;ll call RedBrigade —although that wasn&#39;t even his proper nickname —but I promised I wouldn&#39;t reveal who he was.And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004he would go on sprees in New York,taking out $10,000 from an ATM here,$30,000 from an ATM there,using cloned credit cards.He was making, on average a week,$150,000 —tax free of course.And he saidthat he had so much moneystashed in his upper-East side apartment at one pointthat he just didn&#39;t know what to do with itand actually fell into a depression.But that&#39;s a slightly different story,which I won&#39;t go into now.Now the interesting thing about RedBrigadeis that he wasn&#39;t an advanced hacker.He sort of understood the technology,and he realized that security was very importantif you were going to be a Carder,but he didn&#39;t spend his days and nightsbent over a computer, eating pizza,drinking coke and that sort of thing.He was out there on the townhaving a fab time enjoying the high life.

zh-cn:这是因为黑客只是网络犯罪业的一个环节而且他们通常是所有环节中最脆弱的这点我想通过向大家介绍6位我做调查时遇到的人来进行解释迪米特里·戈卢博夫，亦称“脚本”—1982年生于乌克兰奥德萨市上世纪90年代，他在黑海港口的生活塑造了他的人生观那是一个生死完全靠自己的环境那种环境中，犯罪、腐败行为是生存的必要条件最为一名熟练的电脑使用者迪米特里所做的是把他家乡的强盗资本主义那一套移植到了互联网上他干的非常棒你要知道从他9岁生日开始他所处的环境就只有强盗除此之外他根本不懂如何用其他方法维持生计
en:And this is becausehackers are only one elementin a cybercriminal enterprise.And often they&#39;re the most vulnerable element of all.And I want to explain this to youby introducing you to six characterswho I metwhile I was doing this research.Dimitry Golubov, aka SCRIPT —born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982.Now he developed his social and moral compasson the Black Sea port during the 1990s.This was a sink-or-swim environmentwhere involvement in criminal or corrupt activitieswas entirely necessaryif you wanted to survive.As an accomplished computer user,what Dimitry didwas to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometownonto the Worldwide Web.And he did a great job in it.You have to understand thoughthat from his ninth birthday,the only environment he knewwas gangsterism.He knew no other way of making a livingand making money.

zh-cn:最重要的是关于所有这些人他们都共有同一种特性尽管他们来自完全不同的生活环境但都是在十几岁的时候学习的黑客技术并且都在数学和科学领域展现了高超的才能记住一点，当他们开始开发自己的黑客技术之时都还没有成熟的价值观他们中的大多数，除了SCRIPT 和 Cha0都没有展示出真正的社会技能—仅在网络中展现了
en:Now the important thingabout all of these peopleis they share certain characteristicsdespite the fact that they come from very different environments.They are all people who learned their hacking skillsin their early to mid-teens.They are all peoplewho demonstrate advanced abilityin maths and the sciences.Remember that, when they developed those hacking skills,their moral compass had not yet developed.And most of them, with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha0,they did not demonstrateany real social skills in the outside world —only on the Web.

en:Now I think we&#39;re missing a trick here,because I don&#39;t think people like Max Vision should be in jail.And let me be blunt about this.In China, in Russia and in loads of other countriesthat are developing cyber-offensive capabilities,this is exactly what they are doing.They are recruiting hackersboth before and after they become involvedin criminal and industrial espionage activities —are mobilizing themon behalf of the state.We need to engageand find ways of offering guidanceto these young people,because they are a remarkable breed.And if we rely, as we do at the moment,solely on the criminal justice systemand the threat of punitive sentences,we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame.
