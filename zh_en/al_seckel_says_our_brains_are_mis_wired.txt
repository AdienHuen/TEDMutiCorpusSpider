zh-cn:我今天的演讲是特别为TED准备的我会展示一些特别为TED制作的幻象并将试着把这些幻象和幸福相关联我曾想幸福是什么，什么给人幸福幸福对我来说等同于快乐我想这其中有些根本的东西我曾经考虑过这个问题幸福是我们对于所见的幻象、电影笑话、魔术表演的期望被一种令人愉快的方式所违背了你去看电影的时候，电影里有些意外的转折一些你没有意料到的－－从而你有了一段快乐的经历。你在我的书里看见这类出乎你意料的幻象其中蕴含着快乐这与笑话这类事物是同一类东西。所以，我在演讲中将试着更进一步看看我能否以令人愉快的方式违背你的期望我是说，有时期望被冒犯并不愉快，但是我将试着以愉快的方式做这事儿，以非常简单的方式让在座各位感到快乐
en:We&#39;re going to talk — my — a new lecture, justfor TED — and I&#39;m going show you some illusionsthat we&#39;ve created for TED, and I&#39;m going to tryto relate this to happiness. What I was thinkingabout with happiness is, what gives happiness —or happiness, which I equate with joy in myparticular area, and I think there&#39;s something veryfundamental. And I was thinking about this. Andit&#39;s in terms of both illusions and movies that wego see and jokes and magic shows is that there&#39;ssomething about these things where ourexpectations are violated in some sort of pleasingway. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpectedtwist — something that you didn&#39;t expect — andyou find a joyful experience. You look at thosesort of illusions in my book and it&#39;s not as whatyou&#39;d expect. And there&#39;s something joyful aboutit. And it&#39;s the same thing with jokes and allthese sorts of things. So, what I&#39;m going to tryand do in my lecture is go a little bit furtherand see if I can violate your expectations in apleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations thatare violated are not pleasant, but I&#39;m going to tryto do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way,so I can make the audience here happy.

zh-cn:我将给你展示一些冒犯你的期望的的方式。首先，我想要在这里演示特别的幻象。首先当屏幕上弹出窗口的时候请注意两个孔是相互垂直的这些都是知觉幻象这些是我将给你们演示的真实物件现在，我将演示这是怎么做到的。我这里制作了一个影片，你可以有一个有趣的体验。我给你看到这个幻觉是怎么构造的，物件旋转，你就可以看到这是一个自内而外的东西。现在请看，当它转到背面你的知觉转换是多快。好了，现在请再次看它旋转的背面。这是一个明显的事实，对吧？请看你能否从一开始停止你的想法，即使你百分百确定这是真的。碰！你做不到。这说明了些什么？我们再做一次别怀疑它，看你能否不让这想法产生？不行，这很难
en:So I&#39;m going to show you some ways that we canviolate your expectations. First of all, I want toshow you the particular illusion here. I want youfirst of all when it pops up on the screen tonotice that the two holes are perpendicular toeach other. These are all perceptual tricks. Theseare real objects that I&#39;m going to show you. NowI&#39;m going to show you how it is done. I&#39;ve loopedthe film here so you can get a very interestingexperience. I want you to see how this illusion isconstructed, and it&#39;s going to rotate so you seethat it&#39;s inside out. Now watch, as it rotatesback, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a verybright audience, all right? See if you can stop itfrom happening, even though you know 100 percent it&#39;strue that — bam! You can&#39;t undo it. What doesthat tell you about yourselves? We&#39;re going to doit again. No doubt about it. See if you can stopit from happening. No. It&#39;s difficult.

zh-cn:我们可以在所有关于表述、形状颜色等等不同的方面违背你的期望，都是很基本的这是一个值得考虑的有趣的问题我们为什么发现这些事是快乐的这是Lionel不久前做过的我喜欢这样的小把戏
en:And we can violate your expectations in a wholevariety of ways about representation, about shape,about color and so forth and it&#39;s very primal. Andit&#39;s an interesting question to ponder, why thesethings — we find these things joyful. Why wouldwe find them joyful? So, here&#39;s something thatLionel did a while ago. I like these sort oflittle things like this.

zh-cn:重申一遍，这不是一个光学上的欺骗这是你会看到的。换句话说它不是一个摄像的截取片段，而是一个知觉上的错觉好的。我可以在形状上违背你的期望我还可以在图画中违背你的期望你看到了什么？你们中有谁看到了海豚？请举起手好的，有些人举手了那么剩余的观众去和他们聊一下，可以吗？事实上，这是我知道依凭经验产生错觉的最好的例子如果你是一个不到十岁的天真烂漫的小孩你将会在图画中看到海豚现在，在座的有些大人就会开始问：“哪儿有海豚？”但实际上，如果你对调一下图画的底色换句话说，黑色的部分—我忘记要一只激光笔了-如果你对调一下你将会看到一组小海豚同时，如果你也是一名加州理工的学生—他们也可能只能看到海豚这是基于经验的
en:Again, this is not an optical trick. This is whatyou would see. In other words, it&#39;s not a cameracut. It&#39;s a perceptual trick.OK. We can violate your expectations aboutshape.We can violate your expectations on representation— what an image represents. What do you see here?How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your handif you see dolphins. OK, those people who raisedtheir hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience,go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is thebest example of priming by experience that I know.If you are a child under the age of 10 whohaven&#39;t been ruined yet, you will look at thisimage and see dolphins. Now, some of you adultshere are saying, &quot;What dolphins? What dolphins?&quot;But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground —in other words, the dark areas here — I forgot toask for a pointer — but if you reverse it, you&#39;llsee a whole series of little dolphins. By the way,if you&#39;re also a student at CalTech — they alsotend to just see the dolphins. It&#39;s based onexperience.

zh-cn:现在，一些类似的技巧有了应用价值因为这毕竟也是讨论设计的这是由Saatchi和Saatchi完成的他们在澳大利亚用这个广告侥幸成功了所以如果你看到这个创意为啤酒做广告所有那些人都有几分挑衅的姿态但是它成功了，他们赢得了克里奥广告奖所以做这些事是很有趣的这是佛罗里达州进行投票的时候我做的一个笑话数一下戈尔的得票，再数一下布什的然后再数一遍
en:Now, something like this can be used because thisis after all talk about design, too. This wasdone by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually gotaway with this ad in Australia. So, if you look atthis ad for beer, all those people are in sort ofprovocative positions. But they got it passed, andactually won the Clio awards, so it&#39;s funny how you can dothese things.Remember that sort of, um. This is the joke I didwhen the Florida ballot was going around. Youknow, count the dots for Gore; count the dots forBush; count &#39;em again ...

zh-cn:你会得到违背基于经验的预期结果这是我和朋友们制作的一个室外喷泉你可以使水以水滴的方式静止- 事实上, 是让所有的水滴悬浮起来. 这是我们为游乐园一类的地方设计的东西现在让我们看一个静态图像，看到了吗？你看到中间的部分在向下运动而外边的部分在向上运动吗？事实上它是静止的它是静止的，多少人产生了这个错觉?它是静止的好的，我们看一张图片颜色, 深度和质地的时候是很有趣的你可以看看这个屏幕分析一下，你可以看到那个女人比墙要更近些等等，但是事实上所有的都是平的，它是图画，它是错觉画这是一张很好的错觉画，以至于一些人在和那个女人谈话而得不到她的回应时变得恼怒
en:You can violate your expectations aboutexperience. Here is an outside water fountain thatI created with some friends of mine, but you canstop the water in drops and — actually make allthe drops levitate. This is something we&#39;rebuilding for, you know, amusement parks and thatkind of stuff.Now let&#39;s take a static image. Can you see this?Do you see the middle section moving down and theouter sections moving up? It&#39;s completely static.It&#39;s a static image. How many people see thisillusion? It&#39;s completely static.Right. Now, when — it&#39;s interesting that when welook at an image we see, you know, color, depth,texture. And you can look at this whole scene andanalyze it. You can see the woman is in closer thanthe wall and so forth. But the whole thing isactually flat. It&#39;s painted. It&#39;s trompe l&#39;oeil.And it was such a good trompe l&#39;oeil that peoplegot irritated when they tried to talk to thewoman and she wouldn&#39;t respond.

zh-cn:现在，你可以设计错误了就像这个在纽约的建筑，你从这一边看它阳台看起来是向上倾斜的而当你从另一边看的时候又像是向下倾斜的这是一个在设计中蕴含视觉错觉的例子或者, 看看这张没有被修饰过的照片. 很有趣的是我收到和很多email，问我“男性和女性之间有没有知觉上的区别？”我的回答是否定的。我的意思是女人可以和男人一样在这个世界上生存为什么她们不能呢? 不过, 对于这个视错觉女性肯定比男性更容易辨别这个人头是属于谁的因为她们对时尚更敏感- 她们可以由帽子来确定
en:Now, you can make design mistakes. Like thisbuilding in New York. So that when you see it fromthis side, it looks like the balconies tilt up,and when you walk around to the other side itlooks like the balconies go down. So there arecases where you have mistakes in design thatincorporate illusions.Or, you take this particular un-retouchedphotograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lotof emails from people who say, &quot;Is there anyperceptual difference between males and females?&quot;And I really say, &quot;No.&quot; I mean, women can navigatethrough the world just as well as males can — andwhy wouldn&#39;t they? However, this is the oneillusion that women can consistently do betterthan males: in matching which head because theyrely on fashion cues. They can match the hat.

zh-cn:现在我想展示一些设计中的视错觉. 我认为第一个有意运用视错觉的例子是达芬奇的一幅眼睛变形的作品所以当你取一个小角度看的时候图像是这样的这个技巧在16和17世纪流行于伪装隐含意义稍微调转图像从另一个角度去看它这些技巧的早期运用成为Hans Holbein的画作&quot;使者&quot;的一个热点. Hans Holbein效劳于亨利八世.这幅画挂在楼梯边的墙上, 当你走下楼梯的时候你可以看到隐藏的骷髅头
en:Okay, now getting to a part — I want to showdesign in illusions. I believe that the firstexample of illusions being used purposely was byda Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. Sothat when you saw from one little angle was likethis. And this little technique got popular in the16th century and the 17th century to disguisehidden meanings, where you could flip the image andsee it from one little point of view like this.But these are early incorporations of illusionsbrought to — sort of high point with HansHolbein&#39;s &quot;Ambassadors.&quot; And Hans Holbein workedfor Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where youcould walk down from the stair and you can seethis hidden skull.

zh-cn:好, 现在我要给你们介绍一些运用视错觉创造惊喜的设计师. Scott Kim是我最喜欢的设计师之一.我和他一起为TED设计了一些视错觉, 希望你喜欢.这里有一张关于TED和幸福的Arthur Ganson还没有在这里做过演讲他的演讲会很有趣, 而且他有一些非常有趣的模型所以我和scott为Arthur Ganson设计了一份很棒的礼物
en:All right, now I&#39;m going to show you somedesigners who work with illusions to give thatelement of surprise. One of my favorites is ScottKim. I worked with Scott to create some illusionsfor TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have onehere on TED and happiness.OK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn&#39;t talked yet, but his isgoing to be a delightful talk and he has some ofhis really fantastic machines outside. And so, we— Scott created this wonderful tribute to ArthurGanson.

zh-cn:这个是&quot;近义词&quot;和&quot;数码&quot;, 我觉得这张图片挺适合这里另一张是&quot;肖像&quot;隐藏到底色里这张给音乐家当然, 对于幸福, 我们希望&quot; 把快乐带给世界&quot;另一个在日本非常出名的设计师是Shigeo Fukuda. 他设计了一些奇妙的东西, 非常有趣这里是一堆垃圾取一个特定的角度去看你会发现它在镜子里的像是一架钢琴钢琴家变成小提琴家这个真的很棒. 这个刀叉匙以及各种餐具的组合能产生一个轮廓像摩托车的影子现在你们知道我所做的事儿了有些人闲着没事就喜欢瞎折腾
en:Well, there&#39;s analog and digital. Thought thatwas appropriate here.And figure goes to ground.And for the musicians.And of course, since happiness — we want &quot;joy to theworld.&quot;Now, another great designer — he&#39;s very wellknown in Japan — Shigeo Fukuda. And he justbuilds some fantastic things. This is simplyamazing. This is a pile of junk that when you viewit from one particular angle, you see itsreflection in the mirror as a perfect piano.Pianist transforms to violinist.This is really wild. This assemblage of forks,knives and spoons and various cutlery, weldedtogether. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learnsomething in the sort of thing that I do, whichis there are people out there with a lot of timeon their hands.

zh-cn:Ken Knowlton很擅长合成图像比如用贝壳做一个法国水兵库斯托没有修饰过的贝壳, 只是重新排列一下他用骰子做了一个Einstein, 谁让Einstein说&quot;上帝是不玩骰子的&quot;键盘里的Bert Herzog字谜游戏里的Will ShortzJohn Cederquist 做了这些很棒的有视错觉效果的橱柜
en:Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images, likecreating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells —un-retouched seashells, but just by rearrangingthem. He did Einstein out of dice because, afterall, Einstein said, &quot;God does not play dice withthe universe.&quot; Bert Herzog out of un-retouchedkeyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. JohnCederquist does these wonderful trompe l&#39;oeilcabinets.

zh-cn:因为时间有点紧, 有些东西我就省略不讲了我想给你们看一下我自己设计的一些东西一些新的视错觉体验我做了一些皮克斯式的视错觉图像这两个孩子是一样大的正在跑过走廊. 两张桌子是一样的尺寸他们正在同时朝不同的方向望去这张里大件放进小件里这张是留给你思考的, 好吗?你可以看到大的融进小的. 每个人都看到了吧?这是不可能的. 你可以看到这两个孩子同时面朝两个不同方向. 现在你可以相信这两个桌面是一样的尺寸了吗? 它们的确是如果你量一下, 你会发现它们一样大正如我所说过的, 它们在形状和尺寸上都是一样的通过这种方式来展示视觉错觉是很有趣的无论怎样, 我希望这些都让你觉得快乐和幸福. 如果你想看到更多有趣的东西, 我就在外边我会很乐意给你看更多有趣的东西的
en:Now, I&#39;m going to skip ahead since I&#39;m sort of running[behind]. I want to show you quickly what I&#39;vecreated, some new type of illusions. I&#39;ve donesomething with taking the Pixar-type illusions. Soyou see these kids the same size here, runningdown the hall. The two table tops of the same size.They&#39;re looking out two directions at once. Youhave a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. Andthat&#39;s something for you to think about, allright? So you see larger pieces fitting in withinsmaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Whichis impossible. You can see the two kids arelooking out simultaneously out of two differentdirections at once. Now can you believe these twotable tops are the same size and shape? They are.So, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say,those two figures are identical in size and shape.And it&#39;s interesting, by doing this in this sortof rendered fashion, how much stronger theillusions are. Any case, I hope this has broughtyou a little joy and happiness, and if you&#39;reinterested in seeing more cool effects, see meoutside. I&#39;d be happy to show you lots of things.
