zh-cn:第一个作品叫做“叔叔电话”这个作品是从我叔叔的一个总爱使唤我做事的习惯中获得灵感我就像他身体的延伸部分－帮他开灯或者倒水买包烟我长大后就被使唤得更厉害了我开始觉得这是种控制但是我不能怎么样因为在印度家庭里叔叔是很受尊敬的最烦我而又让我不解的是他用座机打电话的方式他拿着听筒然后让我给他拨号码作为一个给他的回应和礼物我给他做了这个“叔叔电话”这个长到要两个人才能使用的电话正是我叔叔使用明明一个人也能用的电话的方式
en:I&#39;d like to begin with my very first object,which I call &quot;The Uncle Phone.&quot;And it was inspired by my uncle&#39;s peculiar habitof constantly asking me to do things for him,almost like I were an extension of his body —to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,a pack of cigarettes.And as I grew up, it became worse and worse,And I started to think of it as a form of control.But of course, I could never say anything,because the uncle is a respected figurein the Indian family.And the situation that irked me and mystified me the mostwas his use of a landline telephone.He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle,I made him &quot;The Uncle Phone.&quot;It&#39;s so long that it requires two people to use it.It&#39;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that&#39;s designed for one person.

zh-cn:但问题是当我离家上大学后我开始怀念他的使唤于是我给他做了一个金色的打字机这样他能通过电子邮件使唤他四散在世界各地的侄子侄女们他只要拿张纸放进纸夹打印出电子邮件或他的命令然后抽出纸这个设备就能自动把这封信作为电子邮件寄送个收件人你看 我们把许多能检测机械动作并将其转化为数字信号的很多电子配件组装起来这样我叔叔只需使用这个机器外端设备当然这个机器得是很漂亮并带有形式主义的感觉就象我叔叔喜欢的那样
en:But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college,I started missing his commands.And so I made him a golden typewriterthrough which he could dispense his commandsto nephews and nieces around the world as an email.So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage,type his email or command and pull the paper out.This device would automatically send the intended personthe letter as an email.So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronicsthat understands all of the mechanical actionsand converts it to digital.So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism,the way my uncle likes it.

zh-cn:下面一个作品是感声的装置我们亲切地称之为“俾格米人”（非洲小矮人）这个作品的概念是围绕着我们的一群很害羞，敏感而又可爱的部落这些挂在墙上的板的后面藏着这些小人只要很安静的环境下，他们就悄悄探出头来如果更佳安静，他们就一直会伸出脖子来稍稍有动静，他们就立马藏进去
en:The next work is a sound-sensitive installationthat we affectionately call &quot;The Pygmies.&quot;And we wanted to work with a notion of beingsurrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall,and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.And as soon as it&#39;s silent, they sort of creep out.And if it&#39;s even more silent, they stretch their necks out.And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.

zh-cn:这儿一个屋子的三面墙上装着这些板子板子后藏着五百多个这些小俾格米人看看它是怎样的这是一段视频当很安静的时候，他们就从板子后探出脑袋来就象人或者活物一样过了一会儿他们慢慢熟悉了吓到他们的声音就对背景声音不再反应一会儿你能听到火车声音但他们没有反应（噪声）但他们对前景声音仍然敏感 你马上能听到（口哨）我们为了令其栩栩如生费了很大劲每一个俾格米人有其各自的行为特征，心理情绪波动和人格特征这是个很早起的样板当然现在的改进了很多我们让其和人们互动我们发现人们此时会变得象孩子一样很爱玩
en:So we had these panels on three walls of a room.And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.So this is how it works.This is a video prototype.So when it&#39;s quiet, it&#39;s sort of coming out from behind the panels.And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.And they don&#39;t react to background sounds.You&#39;ll hear a train in moment that they don&#39;t react to.(Noise)But they react to foreground sounds. You&#39;ll hear that in a second.(Whistling)So we worked very hardto make them as lifelike as possible.So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche,mood swings, personalities and so on.So this is a very early prototype.Of course, it got much better after that.And we made them react to people,but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.

zh-cn:这是一个叫“失踪者”的摄影装置我们被隐身这个概念启发如果能体验隐身会是什么样的？我们就一家专业从事摄像监视的公司合作请他们为我们设计了一个软件通过一台摄像机能够监视屋子里的人，跟踪他们然后以背景替代影像使其得以隐身
en:This is a video installation called &quot;The Missing Person.&quot;And we were quite intriguedwith playing with the notion of invisibility.How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?So we worked with a companythat specializes in camera surveillance,and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us,using a camerathat could look at people in the room, track themand replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.

zh-cn:这儿看一下早期的视频样板右边你能看到是我的同伴索伦他确实在那儿左边你看到处理过的视频摄像机帮他隐身了索伦进了屋子 唰 他就不见了你能看到摄像机在跟踪他并删除其影像这是个很好的视频还没有处理好影像重叠等问题但是这个很快改进了一个屋子里有一个摄像机监视着然后每个墙上都有一个显示器当人们走进屋子他们能在显示器上看到自己但是总有一个人不论在屋子里怎么移动他都是隐身的
en:So I&#39;m just going to show you a very early prototype.On the right side you can see my colleague Soren,who&#39;s actually in the space.And on the left side, you&#39;ll see the processed videowhere the camera has made him invisible.Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.It&#39;s a very early video,so we haven&#39;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that,but that got refined pretty soon, later.So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space,and we had one monitor, one on each wall.And as people walked into the room,they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference:one person was constantly invisiblewherever they moved in the room.

zh-cn:这个作品叫做“太阳的影子”它看上去就象张纸而已像是个孩子涂鸦出的一个油渍或者太阳正面看这个物体看上去很有活力但是从侧面则看起来很虚弱当人们走进这个屋子 他们基本都没有注意到以为这只是地上垃圾之类但是一旦他们经过旁边它就开始一抽一抽地往上爬接着就精疲力尽 掉了下去
en:So this is a work called &quot;The Sun Shadow.&quot;And it was almost like a sheet of paper,like a cutout of a childlike drawingof an oil spill or a sun.And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust,and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.So people would walking into the room and they&#39;d almost ignore it,thinking it was some crap laying around.But as soon as they passed by,it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.

zh-cn:这个作品是个一个倒立的人的漫画形象他的头非常重，充满了沉重的想法所以他是倒立的帽子着地他的身体象长出来的植物一样他会像醉酒的人一样用一种混乱又极慢的动作移动着但是限制在这个圆内移动因为要是没有这个圆，地板不是很平他就会开始在整个房间乱转他身上没有一根电线给你们展示一下－当人们进屋的时候 就启动了这个装置几分钟内他就很缓慢的痛苦地倒立起来动量聚集到一定程度他就看上去快要倒下去的样子这是个关键时刻因为我们希望激发起观看者的本能去扶起他拯救他但是并不真正需要因为他能再次把自己拉起来
en:So this workis a caricature of an upside-down man.His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts,that it&#39;s sort of fallen into his hat,and his body&#39;s grown out of him almost like a plant.Well what he does is he moves aroundin a very drunken fashion on his headin a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.And it&#39;s kind of constrained by that circle.Because if that circle weren&#39;t there, and the floor was very even,it would start to wander about in the space.And there&#39;s no wires.So I&#39;ll just show you an instance —so when people enter the room, it activates this object.And it very slowly, over a few minutes,sort of painfully goes up,and then it gains momentumand it looks like it&#39;s almost about to fall.And this is an important moment,because we wanted to instill in the vieweran instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.But it doesn&#39;t really need it,because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.
时间： 5:30
zh-cn:这个作品对我们来说是个真正的技术挑战我们努力的几年才把机器装配好 调整好他的平衡和动态运动确定他倒下去的精确时间对我们来说是非常重要的因为如果我们让其倒下去他可能就伤到自己但是如果倒得不够 又不能产生破坏感让人有拯救他的欲望这儿我给你们看一段间断的视频我们正在测试－动作很快那是我的同伴 他放开装置他变得紧张 要去抓住他但是没有必要装置能自己站起来
en:So this work was a real technical challenge for us,and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over yearsto get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.And it was very important for usto establish the exact moment that it would fall,because if we made it in a way that it would topple over,then it would damage itself,and if it didn&#39;t fall enough, it wouldn&#39;t instill that fatalism,or that sense of wanting to go and help it.So I&#39;m going to show you a very quick videowhere we are doing a test scenario — it&#39;s much faster.That&#39;s my colleague. He&#39;s let it go.Now he&#39;s getting nervous, so he&#39;s going to go catch it.But he doesn&#39;t need to,because it manages to lift itself up on its own.

zh-cn:这个作品我们将具有审美感的皮毛上嵌入上千个不同大小的能在夜里发光的光纤背景设置有如真正夜空般大小我们把它裹在一个类似流体态物体上它是个泰迪熊的外形挂在天花板上这个作品的概念是要把象宇宙一样广漠抽象的东西和一个泰迪熊一样熟悉的物体对比而泰迪熊的感觉是舒适亲密的这个作品是想让你能够在某一刻忘记它泰迪熊的形态几乎觉得它只是屋子里的一个洞而你能通过它看到星光点点的夜空
en:So this is a work that we were very intrigued with,working with the aesthetic of furembedded with thousands of tiny different sizesof fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.And it&#39;s at the scale of the night sky.So we wrapped this around a blob-like form,which is in the shape of a teddy bear,which was hanging from the ceiling.And the idea was to sort of contrastsomething very cold and distant and abstract like the universeinto the familiar form of a teddy bear,which is very comforting and intimate.And the idea was that at some pointyou would stop looking at the form of a teddy bearand you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space,and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.

zh-cn:这个是最后一个作品，目前还在制作中它叫做空间填充器试想一下屋子中间有一个立方体当你靠近它 它就会变成两倍高度四倍体积大小来和你互动这个作品就会在有人在周围移动的时候通过扩大和缩小来产生动态效果就好像它试着在结构里藏着什么秘密似的
en:So this is the last work, and a work in progress,and it&#39;s called &quot;Space Filler.&quot;Well imagine a small cube that&#39;s about this bigstanding in front of you in the middle of the room,and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate youby growing into a cubethat&#39;s twice its height and [eight] times its volume.And so this object is constantly expanding and contractingto create a dynamic with people moving around it —almost like it were tryingto conceal a secret within its seams or something.

zh-cn:我们得用上很多科技但是我们并不很热衷科技因为这让我们的工作长久以来费神费力但是我们应用科技因为它能帮我们通过这些作品表达感情和行为特征一旦一个作品的想法出现这个创造的过程就是发现这个物体是要和何种方式存在拥有什么形态和什么方式移动
en:So we work with a lot of technology,but we don&#39;t really love technology,because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.But we use it because we&#39;re interestedin the way that it can help usto express the emotions and behavioral patternsin these creatures that we create.And once a creature pops into our minds,it&#39;s almost like the process of creationis to discover the way this creature really wants to existand what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.
