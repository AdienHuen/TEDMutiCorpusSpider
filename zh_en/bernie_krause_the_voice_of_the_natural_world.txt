zh-cn:(自然之声)45 年前，当我开始记录野外音景的时候完全没意识到蚂蚁、昆虫幼虫、海葵甚至病毒会有自己独特的声音但它们确实有地球上的每个野生栖息地都这样比如你们正听到我身后亚马逊雨林的声音。事实上，温带雨林和热带雨林各自像富有生气的动物管弦乐队，昆虫、爬行动物、两栖动物、鸟类和哺乳动物会发出瞬时和有条理的声调。而且每一种源自野生栖息地的音景也会形成自己独有的特征，其中包含了惊人的信息量今天我想与你们分享其中一些信息音景由三个基本源头组成。第一为自然声或在特定栖息地出现的非生物声音，比如树林中的风声，河溪流水声，波浪拍打岸边的声音，地球的转动声。第二为生物声在特定的栖息地里某个时间段和某个地方生物体产生的声音第三样为所有由人类产生的声音称为人工声其中一些是受控制的，如音乐或戏剧但大多数是混乱和支离破碎的我们将其称为嘈杂声。有某段时间，我认为野外音景就是毫无价值的人工制品，它们只是存在着，但谈不上重要。哦，我错了。我从这些接触认识到仔细聆听是极具价值的工具我们可以评估栖息地整个范围内所有生命的健康状况。60年代后期当我开始录音时，典型的录音方法受到限制，只可捕捉个别物种片断的声音，开始时主要是鸟声，但后来包括了哺乳动物和两栖动物对我来说，有点像从整个交响乐演奏中提取出一把小提琴的声音，而且只听那一部分，从而去理解华丽的贝多芬第五交响曲幸运地，越来越多机构采用我和一些同行共同引进到音景生态学中的模型，而这些模型更具整体性。40 多年前当我开始录音时，每录制 10 小时音景就能截取到 1 小时可用的材料，并可用于唱片或电影原声或博物馆陈列安置中现在由于全球变暖、资源榨取、人为噪音，还包括其他许多因素现在需要超过 1000 小时的录音才能截取同样的音景在我的音景档案中，整整 50 %来自已彻底改变的栖息地中。他们要么一片寂静，要么再不如从前。评估栖息地的通常方法，是在某一特定的区域内，清点看得见物种及其从属物种的数量现在，通过对比密度与多样性结合的数据我可以得出更准确的结论我想给你们看些例子通过深入这宇宙，可将其作为解开一切可能性的典型这是林肯草甸，位于西拉内华达山脉中，距旧金山以东三个半小时车程，海拔约 2000 米，很多年前我就在那儿录音1988 年，一家伐木公司说服当地居民采用一种叫做「选伐」的新伐木方法即零星分散地砍伐而不是把整个区域的树木全部砍伐绝不会对环境有影响我得到了准许，可在那儿伐木前和伐木前后录音。我架好设备，录下大量清晨的鸟叫声录音都有精确的标准，且标有刻度因为我想得到真正高质量的基线这是一个声谱图的范例声谱图是以图像形式表现声音从左到右是时间这个页面有 15 秒从底部到顶部是频率由最低到最高你们可以看到溪流的识别标志大概在图底的 1/3 至 1/2 的地方，草甸中的鸟叫声在图的顶部很多鸟的叫声接下来是伐木以前的林肯草甸声音（自然之声）然而，一年之后我再回到那里，在相同条件下用同样的标准录音且录下了几个同样的晨噪实例，这就是我们现在听到的声音这是在伐木以后的溪流的声音还在底部 1/3 的地方，但请注意上方 2/3 的地方有什么声音不见了（自然之声）接下来是啄木鸟的声音。过去 25 年里我回过林肯草甸 15 次。我能明确告诉你们，那个生物声的密度与多样性，并没有回到伐木之前的样子这是林肯草甸伐木后的照片，你们可从照相机或人眼的视角看到葱茏的树木都还在，这证实了伐木公司的说辞选伐不会对环境表面造成影响可是，我们耳朵听到截然不同的故事年轻的学生们总问我，这些动物到底在说什么，但我真的没有主意但我可以告诉你们，动物确实能表达，我们能否理解则是另外一回事。我曾在阿拉斯加的海滨漫步，碰巧遇到一个潮池，里面到处都是海葵聚居地这种奇妙的吃货是珊瑚和水母的近亲。我好奇它们会否制造声音于是我把水听器一种用橡胶包裹的水下传声器丢到它嘴边，它立刻就把扩音器吞到肚子里，而且触手四处寻找其他有营养价值的东西。这种静态的声音非常低，你们马上就会听到（静态声）呵呵，注意，当它没找到可吃的——（鸣叫声）（笑声）我想这种声音任何人都能听懂。（笑声）在美国西部，大盆地犁足蟾蜍完成繁殖周期后，会把自己埋在距地面约一米的坚硬沙漠土壤下待上几个季节直到条件适合才会再出来。春天时，当土壤中有了足够的水分，青蛙会回到地表，大规模的聚集在巨大且充满春意的水池边。它们齐声高歌，而且彼此同步一致这样做有两个原因第一个是竞争，因为它们在求偶第二个是合作，如果它们一齐同步发声的话土狼、狐狸和猫头鹰等捕食者就很难捕食到某单只青蛙。这个声谱图就是蛙叫的表现形式，而且是很健康的模式（青蛙呱呱地叫）莫诺湖在加利福利亚州约塞米蒂国家公园的东边，这里是一片蟾蜍喜欢的栖息地，然而美国海军喷气机驾驶员也很喜欢，他们在这里训练战士驾驶战斗机时速超过 1100 千米，贴着莫诺盆地上方几百米飞行，极快、极低且声音极大这种人为噪音你们刚才也听到了，尽管距离在蛙塘 6.5 千米但却掩盖了蟾蜍的鸣声在这声谱图中，所有在前一个图中表现出来的能量全部从声谱图顶部消失了，并且齐鸣中有间断，2.5 秒处、4.5 秒处和 6.5 秒处，之后是喷气机的声音，特征是最底部的黄色部分（青蛙呱呱地叫）现在是喷气机飞过的尾声整整45分钟后蛙群才恢复同步齐鸣。在这段时间里，一轮满月高挂夜空，我们发现两只土狼和一只大角猫头鹰抓走了几只青蛙。好消息是，由于栖息地的恢复、飞机噪音减少了影响，在 80 年代和 90 年代初一度递减的青蛙数量现已几乎回到正常我想用一个关于海狸的故事结束演讲，这是一个很悲伤的故事，但真实的展现了动物有时也会表达情感。这论点对一些老生物学家来说颇具争议。有一次，我同事在美国中西部的一个池塘附近录音这个池塘约在 16000 年前的冰川时期末尾形成海狸坝也是池塘的重要组成部分，在一端把整个生态系统连在一起，使其保持微妙的平衡。某天下午，正当他录音时，突然间冒出几个狩猎监督官，无端端地走到海狸坝上，把一串炸药扔到坝底，把坝炸掉了，炸死了许多雌海狸和年幼婴儿同事惊呆了，他躲在后面整理思绪想在下午剩下的时间录下所有他能录下的声音当天傍晚，他发现一件不可思议的事情，幸存的雄海狸组成一个个圈，在水里慢慢游着，为死去的配偶和幼婴悲恸的哭着。或许这是我从所有生物里听到过最悲哀的声音，不管是人还是其他生物（海狸的哭声）好的音景还有其他方面，其中，动物教导我们舞蹈和歌唱我留着下次再讲。但是你们知道了生物声怎样帮助我们理解自然世界你们也听说资源榨取、人为噪音和栖所破坏的影响。环境科学已试着通过我们所看见的去认识这个世界，通过我们所听见的，可有较为充分的认识。生物声和自然声是自然界独特的声音。当我们听到这些声音就会对那地方具有感觉就是我们居住的世界的真实故事。在几秒钟内从许多方面来看，音景揭示了更多的信息由量化数据到创作灵感。在特定的空间范围内，影像撷取隐含地表达局限的正面角度而音景把那个视野范围扩濶到360度，将我们完全包围。如果一张图胜过千言万语，那么一个音景就值一千张图。耳朵告诉我们，每一片树叶和每种生物的窃窃私语诉说着我们生活的自然来源，甚至包含了博爱的真谛，尤其是人性最后一句话就由來自亚马逊森林的美洲豹说吧。（咆哮声）谢谢你的收听（掌声）
en:(Nature sounds)When I first beganrecording wild soundscapes45 years ago,I had no idea that ants,insect larvae, sea anemones and virusescreated a sound signature.But they do.And so does every wildhabitat on the planet,like the Amazon rainforestyou&#39;re hearing behind me.In fact, temperateand tropical rainforestseach produce a vibrant animal orchestra,that instantaneousand organized expressionof insects, reptiles,amphibians, birds and mammals.And every soundscapethat springs from a wild habitatgenerates its own unique signature,one that contains incredibleamounts of information,and it&#39;s some of that informationI want to share with you today.The soundscape is madeup of three basic sources.The first is the geophony,or the nonbiological sounds that occurin any given habitat,like wind in the trees, water in a stream,waves at the ocean shore,movement of the Earth.The second of these is the biophony.The biophony is all of the soundthat&#39;s generated by organismsin a given habitatat one time and in one place.And the third is all of the soundthat we humans generatethat&#39;s called anthrophony.Some of it is controlled,like music or theater,but most of it is chaotic and incoherent,which some of us refer to as noise.There was a time whenI considered wild soundscapesto be a worthless artifact.They were just there,but they had no significance.Well, I was wrong. WhatI learned from these encounterswas that careful listening givesus incredibly valuable toolsby which to evaluatethe health of a habitatacross the entire spectrum of life.When I began recording in the late &#39;60s,the typical methodsof recording were limitedto the fragmented captureof individual specieslike birds mostly, in the beginning,but later animalslike mammals and amphibians.To me, this was a little like tryingto understandthe magnificenceof Beethoven&#39;s Fifth Symphonyby abstracting the soundof a single violin playerout of the context of the orchestraand hearing just that one part.Fortunately, more and more institutionsare implementing the more holistic modelsthat I and a few of my colleagueshave introducedto the field of soundscape ecology.When I began recordingover four decades ago,I could record for 10 hoursand capture one hour of usable material,good enough for an albumor a film soundtrackor a museum installation.Now, because of global warming,resource extraction,and human noise, among many other factors,it can take up to 1,000 hours or moreto capture the same thing.Fully 50 percent of my archivecomes from habitats so radically alteredthat they&#39;re either altogether silentor can no longer be heardin any of their original form.The usual methods of evaluating a habitathave been done by visuallycounting the numbers of speciesand the numbers of individualswithin each species in a given area.However, by comparingdata that ties togetherboth density and diversityfrom what we hear,I&#39;m able to arrive at muchmore precise fitness outcomes.And I want to show you some examplesthat typify the possibilities unlockedby diving into this universe.This is Lincoln Meadow.LincolnMeadow&#39;s a three-and-a-half-hour driveeast of San Franciscoin the Sierra Nevada Mountains,at about 2,000 meters altitude,and I&#39;ve been recordingthere for many years.In 1988, a logging companyconvinced local residentsthat there would be absolutelyno environmental impactfrom a new method they were tryingcalled &quot;selective logging,&quot;taking out a tree here and thererather than clear-cutting a whole area.With permission granted to recordboth before and after the operation,I set up my gear and captureda large number of dawn chorusesto very strict protocoland calibrated recordings,because I wanted a really good baseline.This is an example of a spectrogram.A spectrogram is a graphicillustration of soundwith time from leftto right across the page —15 seconds in this case is represented —and frequency from the bottomof the page to the top,lowest to highest.And you can seethat the signature of a streamis represented here in the bottomthird or half of the page,while birds that were once in that meadoware represented in the signatureacross the top.There were a lot of them.And here&#39;s Lincoln Meadowbefore selective logging.(Nature sounds)Well, a year later I returned,and using the same protocolsand recording under the same conditions,I recorded a number of examplesof the same dawn choruses,and now this is what we&#39;ve got.This is after selective logging.You can see that the streamis still representedin the bottom third of the page,but notice what&#39;s missingin the top two thirds.(Nature sounds)Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker.Well, I&#39;ve returnedto Lincoln Meadow 15 timesin the last 25 years,and I can tell you that the biophony,the density and diversityof that biophony,has not yet returnedto anything like it wasbefore the operation.But here&#39;s a pictureof Lincoln Meadow taken after,and you can seethat from the perspective of the cameraor the human eye,hardly a stick or a treeappears to be out of place,which would confirm the loggingcompany&#39;s contentionthat there&#39;s nothingof environmental impact.However, our ears tell usa very different story.Young students are always asking mewhat these animals are saying,and really I&#39;ve got no idea.But I can tell you that they doexpress themselves.Whether or not we understandit is a different story.I was walking along the shore in Alaska,and I came across this tide poolfilled with a colony of sea anemones,these wonderful eating machines,relatives of coral and jellyfish.And curious to seeif any of them made any noise,I dropped a hydrophone,an underwater microphonecovered in rubber,down the mouth part,and immediately the critter beganto absorb the microphone into its belly,and the tentacles weresearching out of the surfacefor something of nutritional value.The static-like sounds that are very low,that you&#39;re going to hear right now.(Static sounds)Yeah, but watch. When itdidn&#39;t find anything to eat —(Honking sound)(Laughter)I think that&#39;s an expressionthat can be understoodin any language.(Laughter)At the end of its breeding cycle,the Great Basin Spadefoot toaddigs itself down about a meter underthe hard-panned desertsoil of the American West,where it can stay for many seasonsuntil conditions are justright for it to emerge again.And when there&#39;s enough moisturein the soilin the spring, frogs will digthemselves to the surfaceand gather around theselarge, vernal poolsin great numbers.And they vocalize in a chorusthat&#39;s absolutely in syncwith one another.And they do that for two reasons.The first is competitive,because they&#39;re looking for mates,and the second is cooperative,because if they&#39;reall vocalizing in sync together,it makes it really difficultfor predators like coyotes,foxes and owls to singleout any individual for a meal.This is a spectrogramof what the frog chorusing looks likewhen it&#39;s in a very healthy pattern.(Frogs croaking)Mono Lake is just to the eastof Yosemite National Parkin California,and it&#39;s a favoritehabitat of these toads,and it&#39;s also favored by U.S.Navy jet pilots,who train in their fightersflying them at speedsexceeding 1,100 kilometers an hourand altitudes only a couple hundred metersabove ground level of the Mono Basin,very fast, very low, and so loudthat the anthrophony, the human noise,even though it&#39;s six and a half kilometersfrom the frog pond youjust heard a second ago,it masked the soundof the chorusing toads.You can see in this spectrogramthat all of the energythat was once in the firstspectrogram is gonefrom the top end of the spectrogram,and that there&#39;s breaksin the chorusing at two and a half,four and a half,and six and a half seconds,and then the soundof the jet, the signature,is in yellow at the verybottom of the page.(Frogs croaking)Now at the end of that flyby,it took the frogs fully 45 minutesto regain their chorusing synchronicity,during which time, and under a full moon,we watched as two coyotesand a great horned owlcame in to pickoff a few of their numbers.The good news is that, with a little bitof habitat restorationand fewer flights, the frog populations,once diminishingduring the 1980s and early &#39;90s,have pretty much returned to normal.I want to end with a storytold by a beaver.It&#39;s a very sad story,but it really illustrates how animalscan sometimes show emotion,a very controversial subjectamong some older biologists.A colleague of mine was recordingin the American Midwestaround this pond that had been formedmaybe 16,000 years ago at the endof the last ice age.It was also formed in part by a beaver damat one end that heldthat whole ecosystem togetherin a very delicate balance.And one afternoon, while he was recording,there suddenly appearedfrom out of nowherea couple of game wardens,who for no apparent reason,walked over to the beaver dam,dropped a stick of dynamitedown it, blowing it up,killing the female and her young babies.Horrified, my colleagues remained behindto gather his thoughtsand to record whatever he couldthe rest of the afternoon,and that evening, he captureda remarkable event:the lone surviving male beaverswimming in slow circlescrying out inconsolably for itslost mate and offspring.This is probably the saddest soundI&#39;ve ever heard coming from any organism,human or other.(Beaver crying)Yeah. Well.There are many facets to soundscapes,among them the ways in which animalstaught us to dance and sing,which I&#39;ll save for another time.But you have heard how biophonieshelp clarify our understandingof the natural world.You&#39;ve heard the impactof resource extraction,human noise and habitat destruction.And where environmentalsciences have typicallytried to understandthe world from what we see,a much fuller understandingcan be got from what we hear.Biophonies and geophoniesare the signature voicesof the natural world,and as we hear them,we&#39;re endowed with a sense of place,the true story of the world we live in.In a matter of seconds,a soundscape reveals much more informationfrom many perspectives,from quantifiable datato cultural inspiration.Visual capture implicitly framesa limited frontal perspectiveof a given spatial context,while soundscapes widen that scopeto a full 360 degrees,completely enveloping us.And while a picture maybe worth 1,000 words,a soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures.And our ears tell usthat the whisperof every leaf and creaturespeaks to the naturalsources of our lives,which indeed may hold the secretsof love for all things,especially our own humanity,and the last word goesto a jaguar from the Amazon.(Growling)Thank you for listening.(Applause)
