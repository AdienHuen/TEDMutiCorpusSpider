zh-cn:大家有没有想过要年轻再久一点延缓衰老呢？这是很久以来的梦想了不过科学家以前一直认为这大概根本永远不可能他们认为每个人就是慢慢被消耗这个事实没办法改变就像被磨损的旧鞋子不过转而观察大自然的话我们发现不同种的动物寿命差异可以非常之大这些动物彼此不一样是因为它们有不同的基因这就启发我们在这些基因里的某个地方，在DNA里面有控制衰老的基因让动物们有不同的寿命期所以有这样的基因我们就能想像到如果我们通过实验改变一个基因那个衰老基因说不定就可以延缓衰老，延长寿命如果这样做了，就可以找到那些衰老基因如果这些衰老基因真的存在并且能找到那也许有人就能对它做点什么
en:Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longerand put off aging?This is a dream of the ages.But scientists have for a long timethought this just was never going to be possible.They thought you just wear out, there&#39;s nothing you can do about it —kind of like an old shoe.But if you look in nature,you see that different kinds of animalscan have really different lifespans.Now these animals are different from one another,because they have different genes.So that suggeststhat somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,are genes for aging,genes that allow them to have different lifespans.So if there are genes like that,then you can imagine that,if you could change one of the genes in an experiment,an aging gene,maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan.And if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.And if they exist and you can find them,then maybe one could eventually do something about it.

zh-cn:所以我们就开始寻找那些控制衰老的基因不过我们没有研究刚才那些动物而是研究一种小小圆圆的蠕虫，叫做秀丽隐杆线虫大小刚好和句子里面逗号的大小差不多我们很有信心能找到相关的基因因为曾经有种长寿变异的个体记录在案所以我们就随机改变线虫的基因寻找长寿的那些结果我们很幸运地发现损坏单个基因daf-2的这种变异能让这种小虫的寿命翻倍
en:So we&#39;ve set out to look for genes that control aging.And we didn&#39;t study any of these animals.Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.And we were really optimistic that we could find somethingbecause there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.So we started to change genes at random,looking for long-lived animals.And we were very lucky to findthat mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2doubled the lifespan of the little worm.
时间： 1:36
zh-cn:所以能看到这条黑色曲线，一个月以后—这些线虫的寿命很短，这就是为什么我们用它们来做寿命的研究—黑色曲线表示一个月以后，正常线虫都死亡了但是同时大部分变异线虫还活着直到又过了同样长的时间它们才死亡现在我来用视频演示线虫真正是什么样子首先这里看到的是正常的线虫大概在我们大学生的年龄—青年人的年龄很可爱的小家伙下面你将看到年轻的长寿变异体它会活到正常线虫两倍的年龄很可怜吧？其实不是它相当活跃，和正常线虫几乎看不出区别而且它们也有繁殖能力—后代的数目可以和正常线虫的一样多
en:So you can see in black, after a month —they&#39;re very short-lived; that&#39;s why we like to study themfor studies of aging —in black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.But at that time,most of the mutant worms are still alive.And it isn&#39;t until twice as longthat they&#39;re all dead.And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.So the first thing you&#39;re going to seeis the normal wormwhen it&#39;s about college student age — a young adult.It&#39;s quite a cute little fellow.And next you&#39;re going to see the long-lived mutant when it&#39;s young.So this animal is going to live twice as long.Is it miserable? It doesn&#39;t seem to be.It&#39;s active. You can&#39;t tell the difference really.And they can be completely fertile —have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do.
时间： 2:20
zh-cn:现在准备拿出手绢来擦眼泪吧你会看到，就在仅仅两周之后正常的线虫就老了可以看见它的头在屏幕下面，在动但是其它部位就只是躺在那儿不动它显然已经在老人院了再看它的身体组织，能看到已经老化了你看，就算从来没见过秀丽隐杆线虫—多数人应该是没见过—你就知道它们老了—这不是很有意思吗？
en:Now get out your handkerchiefs here.You&#39;re going to see, in just two weeks,the normal worms are old.You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.But everything else is just lying there.The animal&#39;s clearly in the nursing home.And if you look at the tissues of the animal, they&#39;re starting to deteriorate.You know, even if you&#39;ve never seen one of these little C. elegans —which probably most of you haven&#39;t seen one —you can tell they&#39;re old — isn&#39;t that interesting?
时间： 2:43
zh-cn:衰老这件事是有普世性的现在这个是daf-2变异体20000个基因里只改变了一个，看年龄是一样的，但是它不在养老院里它看起来在滑雪这就是最酷的地方：它衰老得更慢达到正常线虫衰老一天的程度它们需要两天时间而我告诉其他人这件事的时候他们认为也许这就像一个八九十岁的人看起来身体仍然硬朗一样但是其实更像这样：如果你是个30岁、30多岁的单身汉你去和别人约会然后你见到了一个中意的女孩，想多了解她在饭桌上，你问她，“你多大了？”她说，“我60岁”就像这样。你根本不知道根本不知道她有多大，要不是她告诉你的话
en:So there&#39;s something about aging that&#39;s kind of universal.And now here is the daf-2 mutant.One gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.It&#39;s the same age, but it&#39;s not in the nursing home;it&#39;s going skiing.This is what&#39;s really cool: it&#39;s aging more slowly.It takes this worm two daysto age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.And when I tell people about this,they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old personwho looks really good for being 90 or 80.But it&#39;s really more like this:let&#39;s say you&#39;re a 30 year-old guy — or in your 30s —and you&#39;re a bachelor and you&#39;re dating people.And you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.And you&#39;re in a restaurant, and you say, &quot;Well how old are you?&quot;She says, &quot;I&#39;m 60.&quot;That&#39;s what it&#39;s like. And you would never know.You would never know, until she told you.

zh-cn:（笑声）

时间： 3:35
zh-cn:好了那么daf-2基因到底是什么？正如大家所知，基因是DNA的一部分它们是经编码的指令，用于制造特定功能的蛋白质而daf-2基因的编码对应了一类激素受体图片上可以看到的是一个细胞以及红色的激素受体插在细胞的边缘受体的一部分就像棒球手套外面的部分伸出去当绿色的激素靠近的时候抓住这个激素另外的部分在细胞内向细胞传递信号
en:Okay.So what is the daf-2 gene?Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,they&#39;re instructions to make a protein that does something.And the daf-2 geneencodes a hormone receptor.So what you see in the picture thereis a cell with a hormone receptor in redpunching through the edge of the cell.So part of it is like a baseball glove.Part of it&#39;s on the outside,and it&#39;s catching the hormone as it comes by in green.And the other part is on the insidewhere it sends signals into the cell.
时间： 4:04
zh-cn:好了，那daf-2受体向细胞里传了什么样的信号？我刚刚说过，如果突变细胞里的daf-2基因就能得到一个功能不太给力的受体并且动物的寿命变长这就意味着这个激素受体的正常功能是加速衰老就是图上箭头的意思总之会让衰老来得更快就好像动物的身体里有个死神一直在加速衰老总之这个结论就非常有趣了结论就是，衰老是受基因控制的具体讲是受激素控制的这些激素又是什么样的激素呢？有很多种激素，比如睾酮和肾上腺素你肯定知道很多这些激素和我们身体里的激素差不多daf-2激素受体与胰岛素和IGF-1的受体非常像
en:Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptortelling the inside of the cell?I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,that you get a receptor that doesn&#39;t work as well;the animal lives longer.So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptoris to speed up aging.That&#39;s what that arrow means.It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.So it&#39;s like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself,speeding up aging.So this is altogether really, really interesting.It says that aging is subject to control by the genes,and specifically by hormones.So what kind of hormones are these?There&#39;s lots of hormones. There&#39;s testosterone, adrenalin.You know about a lot of them.These hormones are similarto hormones that we have in our bodies.The daf-2 hormone receptoris very similar to the receptorfor the hormone insulin and IGF-1.
时间： 4:54
zh-cn:至少大家都听说过胰岛素胰岛素是一种激素，在饭后促进身体的组织吸收营养而IGF-1这种激素促进生长这些激素的功能是我们长久以来就知道的但是我们的研究似乎暗示有可能有第三种我们未知的功能—或许也能影响衰老而且看起来似乎的确是这样
en:Now you&#39;ve all heard of at least insulin.Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrientsinto your tissues after you eat a meal.And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time,but our studies suggestedthat maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about —maybe they also affect aging.And it&#39;s looking like that&#39;s the case.
时间： 5:15
zh-cn:所以在我们对秀丽隐杆线虫的小发现之后研究其他动物的研究员提出问题如果在其他动物身上造成同样的daf-2变异也就是激素受体变异它们也会更长寿吗？在苍蝇身上，是的如果改变苍蝇体内这种激素的传递方式，它们就会长寿在老鼠身上也一样—而老鼠是像我们一样的哺乳动物所以其实这是一个古老原始的传递方式一定在很久以前的进化进程中就出现了这样才会让所有动物身上都有这样的效应而且，这些共同的实验前兆也引向到人类的衰老问题上
en:So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans,people who worked on other kinds of animalsstarted asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation,the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals,will they live longer?And that is the case in flies.If you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.And also in mice — and mice are mammals like us.So it&#39;s an ancient pathway,because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolutionsuch that it still works in all these animals.And also, the common precursor also gave rise to people.
时间： 5:46
zh-cn:所以或许在人类中也同样适用确实有迹象表明这点比如，曾有人针对纽约市阿什肯纳兹犹太人做了研究和其他人群一样大多数人活到70或80岁但是有的人活到了90或100岁研究人员发现活到90或100岁的人更有可能有daf-2变异—也就是说，编码了IGF-1受体的那段基因产生了变异这些变异让基因行为与正常基因相比效果更弱一些相当于基因受损了所以这些迹象表明人类对于控制衰老的激素所带来的效果是很敏感的
en:So maybe it&#39;s working in people the same way.And there are hints of this.So for example, there was one study that was donein a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.And just like any population,most of the people live to be about 70 or 80,but some live to be 90 or 100.And what they foundwas that people who lived to 90 or 100were more likely to have daf-2 mutations —that is, changes in the genethat encodes the receptor for IGF-1.And these changes made the gene not act as wellas the normal gene would have acted.It damaged the gene.So those are hintssuggesting that humans are susceptibleto the effects of the hormones for aging.
时间： 6:29
zh-cn:所以接下来的问题当然就是这对与年龄相关的老龄病有影响吗？因为当年龄变老的时候，我们就更可能患上癌症，老年痴呆症心脏病，等等一系列的疾病结果这些长寿的变异体对于这些疾病更有抵抗能力他们几乎不得癌症就算得了，也并不如本来应该的那样严重所以这很有趣，而且这样想来确实有道理他们的身体还年轻所以为什么只有到老年，他们会得衰老的一些疾病这就启发我们如果有疗法或者药片来对人体复制这些减缓衰老的效应也许我们就有办法一下子抵抗所有种类的老龄病那么，激素到底是怎样影响衰老的速度呢？原理是什么呢？
en:So the next question, of course, is:Is there any effect on age-related disease?As you age, you&#39;re much more likelyto get cancer, Alzheimer&#39;s disease,heart disease, all sorts of diseases.It turns out that these long-lived mutantsare more resistant to all these diseases.They hardly get cancer,and when they do it&#39;s not as severe.So it&#39;s really interesting, and it makes sense in a way,that they&#39;re still young,so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?So it suggeststhat, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to taketo replicate some of these effects in humans,maybe we would have a wayof combating lots of different age-related diseasesall at once.So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?How could that work?
时间： 7:13
zh-cn:原来在daf-2变异体中有大量的基因被转变到DNA里面蛋白质编码保护细胞和组织和修复损坏基因的功能同时基因被转变的途径是被一个基因调节器的蛋白质叫FOXO所以在daf 2 的变异体中你可以看到这个X 型绘制图的受体这个受体也运转得不怎么好在这些条件下，蓝颜色的FOXO蛋白质已经转移到核心里面了这个小小的隔室在细胞的最中间同时也坐落在基因的粘合物上你看到一个基因。这里有大量的基因实际上捆绑在FOXO上并且坐落在它们其中的一个上面
en:Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants,a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNAthat encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues,and repair damage.And the way that they&#39;re switched onis by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.So in a daf-2 mutant —you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.The receptor isn&#39;t working as well.Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in bluehas gone into the nucleus —that little compartment there in the middle of the cell —and it&#39;s sitting down on a gene binding to it.You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.And it&#39;s just sitting on one of them.
时间： 7:49
zh-cn:所以FOXO开启着大量的基因同时这些基因也开启着抗氧化的基因这些基因我称呼它为胡萝卜者基因这些蛋白质产物实际上帮助其他的蛋白质的机能运转顺畅同时也帮助蛋白质融合和运转准确同时也给它们护航到细胞中的垃圾场并且回收被损坏的蛋白质DNA修复基因在这些动物身上更活跃免疫系统也更活跃我们展示的许多这些不同基因实际上都作用于daf 2变异体的延长寿命所以这是很有趣的带有这些基因的动物比起普通的有活得更久的潜力它们有能力保护自身免于很多的伤害我们认为这使得它们活得更长
en:So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes,genes I call carrot-giver genes,whose protein productsactually help other proteins to function well —to fold correctly and function correctly.And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the celland recycle them if they&#39;re damaged.DNA repair genesare more active in these animals.And the immune system is more active.And many of these different genes, we&#39;ve shown,actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.So it&#39;s really interesting.These animals have within themthe latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.They have the abilityto protect themselves from many kinds of damage,which we think makes them live longer.
时间： 8:33
zh-cn:那关于正常线虫呢当daf-2受体是活跃的它引发了一系列来阻止FOXO进入到DNA所处的中心所以基因不能激活这就是运作的方式。也就是我们看不到延长寿命的原因除非有daf 2变异体但对线虫来说有什么好处吗胰岛素和IGF-1激素是特别活跃在有利条件下—好的时机下—当食物是充足的，没有很多压力的环境下然后它们促使营养品的产生可以储存食物，用它来补能量成长等
en:So what about the normal worm?Well when the daf-2 receptor is active,then it triggers a series of eventsthat prevent FOXOfrom getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.So it can&#39;t turn the genes on.That&#39;s how it works. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t see the long lifespan,until we have the daf-2 mutant.But what good is this for the worm?Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormonesare hormones that are particularly activeunder favorable conditions — in the good times —when food is plentiful and there&#39;s not a lot of stress in the environment.Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.You can store the food, use it for energy,grow, etc.
时间： 9:10
zh-cn:但我们认为在压力条件下这些激素水平会下降例如在有限的食物供给时我们认为那对于动物而言是个危险信号预示什么不对头它们的保护功能就开启了所以它激活了FOXO，FOXO进入DNA引发这些基因显现来带动细胞能力从而保护和修复自身这是我们认为动物活长久的原因
en:But what we think is that, under conditions of stress,the levels of these hormones drop —for example, having limited food supply.And that, we think,is registered by the animal as a danger signal,a signal that things are not okayand that it should roll out its protective capacity.So it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA,and that triggers the expression of these genesthat improves the ability of the cellto protect itself and repair itself.And that&#39;s why we think the animals live longer.
时间： 9:38
zh-cn:你可以想象FOXO为一个大楼的看门人或许他有点懒但他在那儿掌管着大楼但这是不好的突然，他了解到将有一场飓风所以他自己实际不做任何事但他打起电话—就像FOXO进入到DNA—他打电话给修屋顶的人，修窗户的人油漆工，修地板的人他们都来了，加固了房屋。然后飓风穿过房屋比起它原本的要更加稳固不但如此，它也可以很久矗立不倒甚至不是飓风来临所以这的概念就类似我们认为生命延长力的发生情形
en:So you can think of FOXOas being like a building superintendent.So maybe he&#39;s a little bit lazy,but he&#39;s there, he&#39;s taking care of the building.But it&#39;s deteriorating.And then suddenly, he learns that there&#39;s going to be a hurricane.So he doesn&#39;t actually do anything himself.He gets on the telephone —just like FOXO gets on the DNA —and he calls upthe roofer, the window person,the painter, the floor person.And they all come and they fortify the house.And then the hurricane comes through,and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.And not only that, it can also just last longer,even if there isn&#39;t a hurricane.So that&#39;s the concept herefor how we think this life extension ability exists.
时间：10:22
zh-cn:关于FOXO真正有趣的是有不同种的FOXO我们大家都有FOXO基因但我们不是完全拥有同一种FOXO基因如同我们都有眼睛但有些人是蓝色的眼睛，有些是棕色的我们发现活到90或者100岁人里最常有的某种FOXO基因这是遍布全球的例子正如大家看到的这些星星每一个星星代表一个人群科学家曾问过“好吧，在这些活得非常久人群里FOXO基因有什么不同吗？” 是的我们不知道这起作用的细节但我们知道这FOXO基因能影响人们的寿命这意味着或许如果我们调试一下基因我们可以增加人们的寿命和保健功能
en:Now the really cool thing about FOXOis that there are different forms of it.We all have FOXO genes,but we don&#39;t all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.Just like we all have eyes,but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.And there are certain forms of the FOXO genethat have found to be more frequently presentin people who live to be 90 or 100.And that&#39;s the case all over the world,as you can see from these stars.And each one of these stars represents a populationwhere scientists have asked,&quot;Okay, are there differences in the type of FOXO genesamong people who live a really long time?&quot; and there are.We don&#39;t know the details of how this works,but we do know thenthat FOXO genes can impactthe lifespan of people.And that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit,we can increase the health and longevity of people.
时间：11:12
zh-cn:所以这对我而言很兴奋我们在这些小圆形线虫发现的FOXO是种蛋白质它影响寿命它也影响人们的寿命所以现在我们一直在我们实验室研发药物它会激活这种FOXO细胞现使用人类细胞为了试药用药来延缓衰老和老龄引发的疾病这会行得通，我对此非常乐观
en:So this is really exciting to me.A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round wormsto affect lifespan,and here it affects lifespan in people.So we&#39;ve been trying in our lab nowto develop drugsthat will activate this FOXO cellusing human cells nowin order to try and come up with drugsthat will delay aging and age-related diseases.And I&#39;m really optimistic that this is going to work.
时间：11:36
zh-cn:延缓衰老所熟知的有许多不同蛋白质至少它们中的之一就是药物有种叫TOR，它是另一种营养传感器如同胰岛素传递毁坏TOR基因的变异体如同daf 2变异体—延长线虫苍蝇和老鼠的寿命但在这情况下，已经有种药叫纳巴霉素和TOR蛋白质联系在一起抑制它的活性你可以拿纳巴霉素，给老鼠试试—甚至当它非常老，如同60岁的老人那么老的一只老鼠—如果给老鼠纳巴霉素它会活得久点
en:There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.And for at least one of them, there is a drug.There&#39;s one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor,like the insulin pathway.And mutations that damage the TOR gene —just like the daf-2 mutations —extend lifespan in wormsand flies and mice.But in this case, there&#39;s already a drug called rapamycinthat binds to the TOR proteinand inhibits its activity.And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse —even when it&#39;s pretty old, like age 60 for a human,that old for a mouse —if you give the mouse rapamycin,it will live longer.
时间：12:12
zh-cn:现我不想让大家都去吃纳巴霉素它是适应于人类的药但原因是它会抵制免疫系统所以人们吃了它会因排斥而不能器官移植所以这或许不是种完美的药物来永葆青春但这还是2011年就是这种药，你能把它给非常老的老鼠它会延长它们的寿命这科学试验已经试用于所有这些不同动物身上
en:Now I don&#39;t want you all to go out taking rapamycin.It is a drug for people,but the reason is it suppresses the immune system.So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.So this may not be the perfect drugfor staying young longer.But still, here in the year 2011,there&#39;s a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old agethat will extend their lifespan,which comes out of this sciencethat&#39;s been done in all these different animals.
时间：12:38
zh-cn:所以我非常乐观我认为我希望，它会不久这个延缓衰老梦想早日实现
en:So I&#39;m really optimistic,and I think it won&#39;t be too long, I hope,before this age-old dream begins to come true.

时间：13:19
zh-cn:辛西娅·肯尼娅：我刚在讲这些药不是改变基因它们只会联系到蛋白质本身改变它的活性所以如果你停止服药，蛋白质会返回到平常原则上你可以改变基因还没有科技这样做但我也认为这不是个好主意理由是这些激素就像胰岛素和IGF-1激素和TOR传递它们是最基本的假若你完全没有它们，随后你就病得很重所以可能只会非常小心地调试它们在没有什么意外情况下使它们起作用我想这会更好这种调试就像用药一样会更好当然，也有其他方法激活FOXO甚至不需要胰岛素和IGF-1激素这甚至会更加安全
en:CK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking aboutwould not change the genes,they would just bind to the protein itselfand change its activity.So if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.You could change the genes in principle.There isn&#39;t the technology to do that.But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea.And the reason isthat these hormones,like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway,they&#39;re essential.If you knock them out completely, then you&#39;re very sick.So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefullyto get the benefits without getting any problems.And I think that&#39;s much better,that kind of control would be much better as a drug.And also, there are other ways of activating FOXOthat don&#39;t even involve insulin or IGF-1that might even be safer.

en:MR: I wasn&#39;t suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...(Laughter)There&#39;s a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about,which is a negligible senescence.There are some creatures on this planet alreadythat don&#39;t really do aging.Just move to one side for us, if you would.

zh-cn:辛西娅·肯尼娅：是的，有些动物好像不会衰老例如，有种叫布兰丁的龟它们生长到约这种尺寸它们被标记，我们发现它们是70岁当看着这些70岁龟你不能只从相貌看出区别在这些70岁龟和20岁龟之间70岁龟事实上能更好地探出安巢的好地方它们每年也有更多的后代还有其它这种动物像是某种鸟类就好比这个没人知道它们真的能永世活着或者是什么使得它们不衰老这都不清楚
en:CK: There are. There are some animals that don&#39;t seem to age.For example, there are some tortoises called Blanding&#39;s turtles.And they grow to be about this size.And they&#39;ve been tagged, and they&#39;ve been found to be 70 years old.And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles,you can&#39;t tell the difference, just by looking,between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles.And the 70 year-old ones,actually they&#39;re better at scouting out the good nesting places,and they also have more progeny every year.And there are other examples of these kinds of animals,like turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.And nobody knows if they really can live forever,or what keeps them from aging.It&#39;s not clear.
时间：15:09
zh-cn:如果你看看鸟类，那些活很长的这些鸟的细胞趋于更能抵制许多不同种的环境压力比如高温或过氧化氢，像这类似的我们长寿变异体也是如此它们更能抵制这些压力所以这可能是我所说的传递它在线虫身上设定和运转得非常快有一个不同标准设定点如同鸟身上的那种，以至于鸟类能活很久或许它们甚至在动物中设定得非常不同一点都没有衰老—但我们不得而知
en:If you look at birds, which live a long time,cells from the birds tend to be more resistantto a lot of different environmental stresseslike high temperatureor hydrogen peroxide, things like that.And our long-lived mutants are too.They&#39;re more resistant to these kinds of stresses.So it could be that the pathways that I&#39;ve been talking about,which are set to run really quickly in the worm,have a different normal set pointin something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.And maybe they&#39;re even set really differentlyin animals with no senescence at all — but we don&#39;t know.

en:CK: Yes, that&#39;s right.It&#39;s more like, say, if you were a dog.You notice that you&#39;re getting old, and you look at your humanand you think, &quot;Why isn&#39;t this human getting old?&quot;They&#39;re not getting old in the dog&#39;s lifespan.It&#39;s more like that.But now we&#39;re the human looking out and imagining a different human.
