en:I&#39;m a public school teacher,and I just want to share a story of my superintendent.Her name is Pam Moranin Albemarle County, Virginia,the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.And she&#39;s a very high-tech superintendent.She uses smart boards, she blogs,she Tweets, she does Facebook,she does all this sort of high-tech stuff.She&#39;s a technology leader and instructional leader.But in her office,there&#39;s this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table —peeling green paint, it&#39;s kind of rickety.And I said, &quot;Pam, you&#39;re such a modern, cutting-edge person.Why is this old table in your office?&quot;

en:And she told me, she said,&quot;You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia,in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia,and this table was in my grandfather&#39;s kitchen.And we&#39;d come in from playing, he&#39;d come in from plowing and working,and we&#39;d sit around that table every night.And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledgeand so many insights and so much wisdomcome out around this table,I began to call it the wisdom table.And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office,and it reminds me of him.It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes.&quot;The project I&#39;m going to tell you aboutis called the World Peace Game,and essentially it is also an empty space.And I&#39;d like to think of itas a 21st century wisdom table, really.

en:It all started back in 1977.I was a young man,and I had been dropping in and out of college.And my parents were very patient,but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to Indiaon a mystical quest.And I remember the last time I came back from India —in my long white flowing robesand my big beard and my John Lennon glasses —and I said to my father,&quot;Dad, I think I&#39;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment.&quot;He said, &quot;Well there&#39;s one more thing you need to find.&quot;I said, &quot;What is that, dad?&quot; &quot;A job.&quot;(Laughter)And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.So I got a degreeand it turned out to be education.It was an experimental education program.It could have been dentistry, but the word &quot;experimental&quot; was in it,and so that&#39;s what I had to go for.

en:And I went in for a job interviewin the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city,bought a three-piece suit — my concession to convention —kept my long beard and my afroand my platform shoes — at the time it was the &#39;70s —and I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.And I guess they were hard up for teachersbecause the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro,said I had the job teaching gifted children.And I was so shocked, so stunned,I got up and said, &quot;Well, thank you, but what do I do?&quot;(Laughter)Gifted education hadn&#39;t really taken hold too much.There weren&#39;t really many materials or things to use.And I said, &quot;What do I do?&quot;And her answer shocked me. It stunned me.Her answer set the templatefor the entire career I was to have after that.She said, &quot;What do you want to do?&quot;And that question cleared the space.There was no program directive, no manual to follow,no standards in gifted educationin that way.And she cleared such a spacethat I endeavored from then onto clear a space for my students, an empty space,whereby they could create and make meaningout of their own understanding.

en:So this happened in 1978,and I was teaching many years later,and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.His name is Chris Farina.Chris Farina is here today at his own cost.Chris, could you stand up and let them see you —a young, visionary filmmaker who&#39;s made a film.(Applause)This film is called &quot;World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements.&quot;He proposed the film to me — it&#39;s a great title.He proposed the film to me,and I said, &quot;Yeah, maybe it&#39;ll be on local TV,and we can say hi to our friends.&quot;But the film has really gone places.Now it&#39;s still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice,to get this film out.So we made a filmand it turns out to be more than a story about me,more than a story about one teacher.It&#39;s a story that&#39;s a testament to teaching and teachers.And it&#39;s a beautiful thing.

en:And the strange thing is, when I watch the film —I have the eerie sensation of seeing it —I saw myself literally disappear.What I sawwas my teachers coming through me.I saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell&#39;swry smile under his handlebar mustache.That&#39;s the smile I use — that&#39;s his smile.I saw Jan Polo&#39;s flashing eyes.And they weren&#39;t flashing in anger,they were flashing in love, intense love for her students.And I have that kind of flash sometimes.And I saw Miss Ethel J. Bankswho wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare.You know the one.(Laughter)&quot;And I&#39;m not even talking about you behind me,because I&#39;ve got eyes in the back of my head.&quot;(Laughter)You know that teacher?I didn&#39;t use that stare very often,but I do have it in my repertoire.And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me.

en:And so this World Peace Game I&#39;d like to tell you about.It started out like this:it&#39;s just a four-foot by five-foot plywood boardin an inner-city urban school, 1978.I was creating a lesson for students on Africa.We put all the problems of the world there,and I thought, let&#39;s let them solve it.I didn&#39;t want to lecture or have just book reading.I wanted to have them be immersedand learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.So I thought, well they like to play games.I&#39;ll make something — I didn&#39;t say interactive;we didn&#39;t have that term in 1978 —but something interactive.And so we made the game,and it has since evolvedto a four-foot by four-foot by four-footPlexiglass structure.And it has four Plexiglass layers.

There are billions.The World Bank president was a third-grader one time.He says, &quot;How many zeros in a trillion?

He says, &quot;We have&quot; —and there&#39;s 12 seconds left on the clock —&quot;we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together.And we&#39;ve got 600 billion dollars.We&#39;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country.And if they accept it, it&#39;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game.Will you accept it?&quot;And there are three seconds left on the clock.Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country,and he says, &quot;Yes.&quot;And the game is won.Spontaneous compassionthat could not be planned for,that was unexpected and unpredictable.

zh-cn:每次的游戏都不同某些游戏有关社会议题某些有关经济议题有些有关战争但我从不剥夺他们身为人的真实状态我让他们去探索以一种不流血的方式，自己去经历如何不去做那些自己认为错误的事让他们找到什么是对的用他们自己的方法，自己找在这个游戏里我学了很多我必须说倘若他们可以从游戏里找到批判性思考和创意思考的方式把那变成真正可以解决世界问题的方法来拯救我们所有人如果。
en:Every game we play is different.Some games are more about social issues,some are more about economic issues.Some games are more about warfare.But I don&#39;t try to deny them that reality of being human.I allow them to go thereand, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way,how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing.And they find out what is righttheir own way, their own selves.And so in this game,I&#39;ve learned so much from it,but I would saythat if onlythey could pick up a critical thinking toolor creative thinking toolfrom this gameand leverage something good for the world,they may save us all.If only.
