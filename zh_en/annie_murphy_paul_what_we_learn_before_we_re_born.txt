zh-cn:我今天要谈的是学习对此我想给各位做个小测验准备好了吗？我们从什么时候开始学习？当你考虑这个问题的时候大概会想学前班或者幼儿园的头一天那是孩子在教室见到老师的第一天也许你会想到小孩初习走路和说话时的样子和学习用叉子的时候也许你会想到0－3岁运动那段被认为是最重要的学习阶段这是最早开始学习的时候那么你的答案可能是：从出生就开始学习
en:My subject today is learning.And in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.Ready?When does learning begin?Now as you ponder that question,maybe you&#39;re thinking about the first day of preschoolor kindergarten,the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.Or maybe you&#39;ve called to mind the toddler phasewhen children are learning how to walk and talkand use a fork.Maybe you&#39;ve encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,which asserts that the most important years for learningare the earliest ones.And so your answer to my question would be:Learning begins at birth.

zh-cn:今天我要讲的观点就是也许这很出人意料并且似乎不太有说服力但是根据最新的心理学和生物学研究我们最重要的学习有一部分在我们出生前就开始了那时我们还在子宫里我是一名科学记者写书和给杂志供稿我也是一名母亲这两个角色在我写的一本叫《源头》的书上合为一体《源头》是一本关于一个令人振奋的新领域－胚胎起源论的纪实报道胚胎起源论是一个科学分支出现于大约二十年前其理论基础是我们的终身健康和幸福极大地取决于在子宫中的九个月我对这个理论不仅是知识上的兴趣当我研究这本书的时候我怀孕了我从研究中了解到的最新奇的观点是我们对世界的认知在没有来到这个世界之前就开始了
en:Well today I want to present to youan idea that may be surprisingand may even seem implausible,but which is supported by the latest evidencefrom psychology and biology.And that is that some of the most important learning we ever dohappens before we&#39;re born,while we&#39;re still in the womb.Now I&#39;m a science reporter.I write books and magazine articles.And I&#39;m also a mother.And those two roles came together for mein a book that I wrote called &quot;Origins.&quot;&quot;Origins&quot; is a report from the front linesof an exciting new fieldcalled fetal origins.Fetal origins is a scientific disciplinethat emerged just about two decades ago,and it&#39;s based on the theorythat our health and well-being throughout our livesis crucially affectedby the nine months we spend in the womb.Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.I was myself pregnantwhile I was doing the research for the book.And one of the most fascinating insightsI took from this workis that we&#39;re all learning about the worldeven before we enter it.

zh-cn:当我们怀孕的时候也许以为他们只是白纸一张没有标记的生命但事实上他们已经开始接受来自我们和我们生活的世界的影响今天我想与各位分享一些有趣的事实是关于科学家发现的胎儿在母亲子宫里的学习到的东西
en:When we hold our babies for the first time,we might imagine that they&#39;re clean slates,unmarked by life,when in fact, they&#39;ve already been shaped by usand by the particular world we live in.Today I want to share with you some of the amazing thingsthat scientists are discoveringabout what fetuses learnwhile they&#39;re still in their mothers&#39; bellies.

zh-cn:首先他们会认知母亲的声音因为外界的声音会穿过母亲的身体和包裹着胎儿的羊水胎儿从妊娠四个月开始就能够听见的声音是微弱低沉的一个研究者说那声音听起来就象那部老卡通片《花生米》里查里･布朗的老师的声音但是母亲的声音经过自己身体的反射可以很容易地到达胎儿并且因为一直相处胎儿能一直听到母亲声音一旦出生，宝宝就能识别出母亲的声音并且比起别人的声音宝宝更喜欢母亲的
en:First of all,they learn the sound of their mothers&#39; voices.Because sounds from the outside worldhave to travel through the mother&#39;s abdominal tissueand through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus,the voices fetuses hear,starting around the fourth month of gestation,are muted and muffled.One researcher saysthat they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown&#39;s teacherin the old &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoon.But the pregnant woman&#39;s own voicereverberates through her body,reaching the fetus much more readily.And because the fetus is with her all the time,it hears her voice a lot.Once the baby&#39;s born, it recognizes her voiceand it prefers listening to her voiceover anyone else&#39;s.

zh-cn:我们是怎么知道这一切的呢？新生儿不能做太多事情但是他们很擅长吮吸研究者利用这一点把两个橡胶乳头固定在一起如果婴儿吮吸其中一个就用耳机播放他母亲的录音如果吮吸另一个就播放一个陌生女性的声音婴儿很快表现出他们的偏好他们选择第一个乳头科学家也发现当婴儿被其他事物吸引的时候吮吸的速度就会慢下来或者当他们无聊了也会放慢吮吸研究者通过这一点发现如果母亲在孕期高声地念一章苏斯博士的《帽子里的猫》他们的新生儿在出生后仍然能识别这一段我最喜欢的一个实验是如果母亲在孕期每天看同一个肥皂剧婴儿就能够在出生后识别出这个电视剧的主题曲婴儿甚至能够学习出生环境中使用的语言
en:How can we know this?Newborn babies can&#39;t do much,but one thing they&#39;re really good at is sucking.Researchers take advantage of this factby rigging up two rubber nipples,so that if a baby sucks on one,it hears a recording of its mother&#39;s voiceon a pair of headphones,and if it sucks on the other nipple,it hears a recording of a female stranger&#39;s voice.Babies quickly show their preferenceby choosing the first one.Scientists also take advantage of the factthat babies will slow down their suckingwhen something interests themand resume their fast suckingwhen they get bored.This is how researchers discoveredthat, after women repeatedly read alouda section of Dr. Seuss&#39; &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; while they were pregnant,their newborn babies recognized that passagewhen they hear it outside the womb.My favorite experiment of this kindis the one that showed that the babiesof women who watched a certain soap operaevery day during pregnancyrecognized the theme song of that showonce they were born.So fetuses are even learningabout the particular language that&#39;s spokenin the world that they&#39;ll be born into.

zh-cn:去年发表的一个研究说道从出生那一刻开始婴儿就会用母亲母语的口音啼哭法国婴儿哭起来升调而德国婴儿哭起来降调就象模拟他们各自语言的音律轮廓那么这些发现都有什么用呢？这些是进化中帮助婴儿生存的技能从出生那一刻起婴儿就对最关怀他的人也就是母亲的声音反应最强甚至按照母亲语言的腔调啼哭这会让母婴关系更亲密也帮助婴儿开始重要的母语理解和学习
en:A study published last yearfound that from birth, from the moment of birth,babies cry in the accentof their mother&#39;s native language.French babies cry on a rising notewhile German babies end on a falling note,imitating the melodic contoursof those languages.Now why would this kind of fetal learningbe useful?It may have evolved to aid the baby&#39;s survival.From the moment of birth,the baby responds most to the voiceof the person who is most likely to care for it —its mother.It even makes its criessound like the mother&#39;s language,which may further endear the baby to the mother,and which may give the baby a head startin the critical taskof learning how to understand and speakits native language.

zh-cn:婴儿在子宫里学习不仅是声音也学习味道和气味妊娠七个月的时候胎儿的味蕾已经完全发育嗅觉器官的神经末梢也能工作了孕妇摄取食物的味道通过羊水被胎儿吞食婴儿似乎能够在出生后仍然记住这些味道并对其产生偏好在一个实验中，一组孕妇被要求在晚期妊娠中喝下许多胡萝卜汁而另一组孕妇则只饮水六个月后他们喂食新生儿含胡萝卜汁的麦片粥并观察他们的面部表情喝过胡萝卜汁母亲的孩子会吃更多的胡萝卜汁味的麦片粥他们看起来更喜欢这个味道
en:But it&#39;s not just soundsthat fetuses are learning about in utero.It&#39;s also tastes and smells.By seven months of gestation,the fetus&#39; taste buds are fully developed,and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell,are functioning.The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eatsfind their way into the amniotic fluid,which is continuously swallowedby the fetus.Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastesonce they&#39;re out in the world.In one experiment, a group of pregnant womenwas asked to drink a lot of carrot juiceduring their third trimester of pregnancy,while another group of pregnant womendrank only water.Six months later, the women&#39;s infantswere offered cereal mixed with carrot juice,and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.The offspring of the carrot juice drinking womenate more carrot-flavored cereal,and from the looks of it,they seemed to enjoy it more.

zh-cn:法国也有一个类似的试验是在法国第戎进行的研究者发现母亲在孕期摄取的食物和饮料是甘草茴香味的话婴儿从出生起就偏好茴香味其后第四天的测试中也是这样但是母亲没有在妊娠期食用茴香的婴儿则表现出“恶心”的表情也就是说婴儿强烈地受到母亲影响哪些食物是安全好吃的婴儿也被教授他们出生地的文化文化的一个重要内容就是食物他们甚至在出生之前就尝试到这个文化的食物具有的特定的味道和香料
en:A sort of French version of this experimentwas carried out in Dijon, Francewhere researchers foundthat mothers who consumed food and drinkflavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancyshowed a preference for aniseon their first day of life,and again, when they were tested later,on their fourth day of life.Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancyshowed a reaction that translated roughly as &quot;yuck.&quot;What this meansis that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothersabout what is safe and good to eat.Fetuses are also being taughtabout the particular culture that they&#39;ll be joiningthrough one of culture&#39;s most powerful expressions,which is food.They&#39;re being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spicesof their culture&#39;s cuisineeven before birth.

zh-cn:不过胎儿学习的东西还有更多的首先我想解释下你可能疑惑的地方胎儿学习这个概念可能会让你有胎教的想法－就像把耳机放在大肚子上放莫扎特但是九个月的妊娠过程子宫里的变化和发展是更接近器官性的间接发生的一种关系一个孕妇每天的生活中－她呼吸的空气摄取的食物和饮料接触到的化学物质甚至是她的情绪－都会影响到胎儿这些影响混合在一起既是各自对婴儿的外界影响也是母亲自己对婴儿的影响婴儿接受到这些影响成为他们自身的一部分并产生更多的影响母亲传递这些内容对他们是信息我将其称为来自外界的生物名信片
en:Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.But before I get to that,I want to address something that you may be wondering about.The notion of fetal learningmay conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus —like playing Mozart through headphonesplaced on a pregnant belly.But actually, the nine-month-long processof molding and shaping that goes on in the wombis a lot more visceral and consequential than that.Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life —the air she breathes,the food and drink she consumes,the chemicals she&#39;s exposed to,even the emotions she feels —are shared in some fashion with her fetus.They make up a mix of influencesas individual and idiosyncraticas the woman herself.The fetus incorporates these offeringsinto its own body,makes them part of its flesh and blood.And often it does something more.It treats these maternal contributionsas information,as what I like to call biological postcardsfrom the world outside.
时间： 8:42
zh-cn:所以婴儿在子宫里学到的不是莫扎特的魔笛而是对他们更重要的生存问题的解答他出生的世界会资源充足还是贫乏？他能受到保护吗还是得面对危险和威胁？他能生活得长久富足吗还是短暂折磨的生活？孕妇的食物和压力水平就象标杆一样给出了她所处环境的线索对婴儿大脑和其他器官影响的结果是人类所处环境多样性的部分结果我们在各种各样环境中生存的能力从乡村到城市从苔原到沙漠
en:So what a fetus is learning about in uterois not Mozart&#39;s &quot;Magic Flute&quot;but answers to questions much more critical to its survival.Will it be born into a world of abundanceor scarcity?Will it be safe and protected,or will it face constant dangers and threats?Will it live a long, fruitful lifeor a short, harried one?The pregnant woman&#39;s diet and stress level in particularprovide important clues to prevailing conditionslike a finger lifted to the wind.The resulting tuning and tweakingof a fetus&#39; brain and other organsare part of what give us humansour enormous flexibility,our ability to thrivein a huge variety of environments,from the country to the city,from the tundra to the desert.

zh-cn:总而言之我想说两个母亲是怎样在孩子尚未出生之前教他们认识世界的1944年秋天二战进行最惨烈的期间德国军队封锁了荷兰西部截下所有运送食物的车辆纳粹围攻开始后是十年间最难熬的一个冬天运河全都冻住了食物紧缺很多荷兰人每天只摄取500卡路里－只有战前的四分之一这样挣扎了几个月一些人开始吃郁金香的球茎五月初国家苦心经营的粮食配给终于告罄大片的饥荒开始蔓延后来1945年五月五号包围突然结束荷兰被盟军解放
en:To conclude, I want to tell you two storiesabout how mothers teach their children about the worldeven before they&#39;re born.In the autumn of 1944,the darkest days of World War II,German troops blockaded Western Holland,turning away all shipments of food.The opening of the Nazi&#39;s siegewas followed by one of the harshest winters in decades —so cold the water in the canals froze solid.Soon food became scarce,with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day —a quarter of what they consumed before the war.As weeks of deprivation stretched into months,some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.By the beginning of May,the nation&#39;s carefully rationed food reservewas completely exhausted.The specter of mass starvation loomed.And then on May 5th, 1945,the siege came to a sudden endwhen Holland was liberatedby the Allies.

zh-cn:这个“饥荒的冬天”里大概有10,000丧生上千人虚弱不堪同时还有个群体也受到了影响－40,000名在围攻期间还在母腹中的胎儿妊娠期间的营养不良导致后来出现的极高的死胎出生缺陷 新生儿体重不足和新生儿死亡但还有一些影响很多年后才显现出来“饥荒的冬天”数十年后研究者纪录了在包围期间怀孕的母亲产下的孩子在其后的生活中比起其他在正常怀孕状况产下的孩子有更高的肥胖症，糖尿病和心脏病症状这些人在胎儿期经历了饥荒从而在诸多方面身体受到了影响他们的血压更高高胆固醇低葡萄糖耐量－糖尿病的前兆
en:The &quot;Hunger Winter,&quot; as it came to be known,killed some 10,000 peopleand weakened thousands more.But there was another population that was affected —the 40,000 fetusesin utero during the siege.Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancywere immediately apparentin higher rates of stillbirths,birth defects, low birth weightsand infant mortality.But others wouldn&#39;t be discovered for many years.Decades after the &quot;Hunger Winter,&quot;researchers documentedthat people whose mothers were pregnant during the siegehave more obesity, more diabetesand more heart disease in later lifethan individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.These individuals&#39; prenatal experience of starvationseems to have changed their bodiesin myriad ways.They have higher blood pressure,poorer cholesterol profilesand reduced glucose tolerance —a precursor of diabetes.
时间：11:36
zh-cn:为什么母体中经历的营养不良会引发这些疾病？一个解释是婴儿会在恶劣环境下最大化生存可能当食物紧缺他们把营养留给最重要的器官－大脑而减少其他器官诸如心脏和肝脏的供给这能让胎儿在短期内生存但是影响在后来的生活中显现当这些早期无法获得足够营养的器官就变的更容易受到疾病影响
en:Why would undernutrition in the wombresult in disease later?One explanationis that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.When food is scarce,they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain,and away from other organslike the heart and liver.This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term,but the bill comes due later on in lifewhen those other organs, deprived early on,become more susceptible to disease.
时间：12:05
zh-cn:但是这还不能说明全部状况似乎婴儿在从他们的子宫环境中获取信息从而去适应他们准备好自身来面对母体外的世界胎儿调整自身的新成代谢和其他生理机能来应对将到来的世界而胎儿对此判断的依据就是母亲的食物一个孕妇的食物形成了一个故事一个富饶的童话或者一个严酷挣扎的编年史婴儿从故事中获取信息并据此组织自身系统－这是对外部环境的适应来保证自己的生存面对有限的资源个头小的孩子能减少能源需求从而增加长到成年的几率
en:But that may not be all that&#39;s going on.It seems that fetuses are taking cuesfrom the intrauterine environmentand tailoring their physiology accordingly.They&#39;re preparing themselvesfor the kind of world they will encounteron the other side of the womb.The fetus adjusts its metabolismand other physiological processesin anticipation of the environment that awaits it.And the basis of the fetus&#39; predictionis what its mother eats.The meals a pregnant woman consumesconstitute a kind of story,a fairy tale of abundanceor a grim chronicle of deprivation.This story imparts informationthat the fetus usesto organize its body and its systems —an adaptation to prevailing circumstancesthat facilitates its future survival.Faced with severely limited resources,a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirementswill, in fact, have a better chanceof living to adulthood.

zh-cn:真正的问题是当怀孕的母亲是个不可靠的引导者婴儿就会被引导了去预期一个匮乏的环境但是出生到一个丰足的环境里这就是荷兰“饥荒的冬天”环境出生的孩子他们的高肥胖率糖尿病和心脏病就是这样的结果他们的身体准备寻找每一个卡路里但是发现战后的西方饮食中是卡路里的海洋他们在子宫里对外界的认知跟他们实际出生的世界是不一样的
en:The real trouble comeswhen pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators,when fetuses are ledto expect a world of scarcityand are born instead into a world of plenty.This is what happened to the children of the Dutch &quot;Hunger Winter.&quot;And their higher rates of obesity,diabetes and heart diseaseare the result.Bodies that were built to hang onto every caloriefound themselves swimming in the superfluous caloriesof the post-war Western diet.The world they had learned about while in uterowas not the sameas the world into which they were born.

zh-cn:还有一个故事2001年9月11日早上八点四十六分纽约的世贸中心周边地区有上万人－乘地铁上班的人因为早晨高峰期忙碌的服务生在华尔街开始工作的股票经纪人这些人里有1,700人是孕妇当飞机撞向双子塔很多女性经历了恐惧感很多其他灾难幸存者也经历过的－这种无比巨大的混乱不堪滚滚升起的浓烟裹着可能有毒的烟尘和残骸还有死亡的恐惧
en:Here&#39;s another story.At 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001,there were tens of thousands of peoplein the vicinity of the World Trade Centerin New York —commuters spilling off trains,waitresses setting tables for the morning rush,brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.1,700 of these people were pregnant women.When the planes struck and the towers collapsed,many of these women experienced the same horrorsinflicted on other survivors of the disaster —the overwhelming chaos and confusion,the rolling cloudsof potentially toxic dust and debris,the heart-pounding fear for their lives.

zh-cn:911事件一年后研究者调查了一组是在经历世贸中心袭击事件怀孕的女性这些女性在精神创伤后表现出了创伤后应激障碍PTSD研究者发现了她们孩子身上有对PTSD敏感的生物学标志母亲在晚期妊娠期间经历的孩子表现出最显著的这种特征也就是说有创伤后应激障碍的母亲把对环境的脆弱性也传递给了还在子宫中的孩子
en:About a year after 9/11,researchers examined a group of womenwho were pregnantwhen they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.In the babies of those womenwho developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD,following their ordeal,researchers discovered a biological markerof susceptibility to PTSD —an effect that was most pronouncedin infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophein their third trimester.In other words,the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndromehad passed on a vulnerability to the conditionto their children while they were still in utero.
时间：15:06
zh-cn:那么创伤后应激障碍是一种对压力的过度反应导致受害者遭受不必要的痛苦但是也可以从另一个角度看PTSD从病理学角度的一个解释也许在某种情况下这是一种有用的适应在一个危险的环境中PTSD的特征表现－对环境极度敏感对危险快速反应能救一个人的命产前PTSD母婴遗传的概念仍然在研究中但我发现重要的是这意味着在出生之前母亲就在警告孩子世界很危险告诉他们“要小心”
en:Now consider this:post-traumatic stress syndromeappears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong,causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.But there&#39;s another way of thinking about PTSD.What looks like pathology to usmay actually be a useful adaptationin some circumstances.In a particularly dangerous environment,the characteristic manifestations of PTSD —a hyper-awareness of one&#39;s surroundings,a quick-trigger response to danger —could save someone&#39;s life.The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptiveis still speculative,but I find it rather poignant.It would mean that, even before birth,mothers are warning their childrenthat it&#39;s a wild world out there,telling them, &quot;Be careful.&quot;

zh-cn:整理一下胚胎起源论不是责备母亲发生在孕期的事情而在于发现怎样才能提高下一代的身心健康这个努力与胎儿在子宫的九个月是分不开的学习是生命最重要的活动之一并且比我们想像的早就开始了
en:Let me be clear.Fetal origins research is not about blaming womenfor what happens during pregnancy.It&#39;s about discovering how best to promotethe health and well-being of the next generation.That important effort must include a focuson what fetuses learnduring the nine months they spend in the womb.Learning is one of life&#39;s most essential activities,and it begins much earlierthan we ever imagined.
