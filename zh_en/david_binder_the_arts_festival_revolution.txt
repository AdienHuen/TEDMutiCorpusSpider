zh-cn:悉尼，我等来到悉尼的这一天等了太久了我到达机场后，来到酒店，登记入住然后坐在大厅里看到一本悉尼艺术节的小册子我一页页地翻看直到我的目光停在了一个名叫“Minto现场秀”的演出上这场秀被描述为&quot;Minto郊区的街道是一个为各国艺术家以及Minto居民合作表演的舞台&quot;
en:Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney.I got to the airport, to the hotel, checked in,and, sitting there in the lobby, was a brochurefor the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it,and I came across a show called &quot;Minto: Live.&quot;The description read: &quot;The suburban streets of Mintobecome the stage for performancescreated by international artistsin collaboration with the people of Minto.&quot;

zh-cn:这个Minto到底是一个怎样的地方呢？悉尼，据我所知，是一个由郊区组成的城市Minto坐落于城市西南方向一小时车程的地方我不得不说，当我第一次踏足Minto时它与我想象中的不大一样我想到的是类似港湾大桥或是邦迪海滩那种地方然而Minto？尽管如此，作为一名制片人独具地方特色的剧场表演于我而言是无法抗拒的诱惑（笑声）
en:What was this place called Minto?Sydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs,and Minto lies southwest, about an hour away.I have to say, it wasn&#39;t exactly what I had in mindfor my first day down under.I mean, I&#39;d thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach,but Minto? But still, I&#39;m a producer,and the lure of a site-specific theater projectwas more than I could resist. (Laughter)

zh-cn:于是，周五下午我穿越重重车流到达Minto的时候我永远不会忘记我看到的景象在演出时，观众们围绕着这片社区沿着一户户人家步行本地居民，同时也是表演者从他们的家中走出来在自家的草坪上，车道上跳起了自传性的舞蹈（笑声）Minto现场秀是联合了一家名叫Lone Twin的英国剧团共同打造的。Lone Twin 来到 Minto 与本地的居民合作他们一起编排了富有创意的舞蹈
en:So, off I went into Friday afternoon traffic,and I&#39;ll never forget what I saw when I got there.For the performance, the audience walkedaround the neighborhood from house to house,and the residents, who were the performers,they came out of their houses, and they performedthese autobiographical dances on their lawns,on their driveways. (Laughter)The show is a collaboration with a U.K.-basedperformance company called Lone Twin.Lone Twin had come to Minto and workedwith the residents, and they had created these dances.

zh-cn:这名澳印混血女孩走到了她的草坪上开始在上面舞蹈同时她的父亲透过窗户瞟看外面的声音和骚动是为何事然后他走出来和女儿一起跳舞接下来女孩的小妹妹也加入他们不一会儿他们一家人聚在他们的草坪上跳的不亦乐乎
en:This Australian-Indian girl, she came out and startedto dance on her front lawn,and her father peered out the window to seewhat all the noise and commotion was about,and he soon joined her.And he was followed by her little sister.And soon they were all dancing this joyous,exuberant dance right there on their lawn. (Laughter)

zh-cn:当我在这片社区上闲逛时我被这个社区居民的积极参与以及他们对这个节日的热忱震惊了并深深感动了&quot;Minto现场秀&quot;为悉尼人与国际艺术家提供了一次合作交流并彰显了悉尼的文化多样性
en:And as I walked through the neighborhood,I was amazed and I was moved by the incrediblesense of ownership this community clearly feltabout this event.&quot;Minto: Live&quot; brought Sydneysiders into dialoguewith international artists, and really celebratedthe diversity of Sydney on its own terms.

zh-cn:悉尼艺术节承办的&quot;Minto现场秀&quot;代表了一类新的21世纪艺术节形式这一类艺术节开放性很强它们可以改造并提升城市与社区
en:The Sydney Festival which produced &quot;Minto: Live&quot; I thinkrepresents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival.These festivals are radically open.They can transform cities and communities.

zh-cn:为了更好的理解这一点我想我们应该回到艺术节的起源现代艺术节诞生于后二战时期的废土之上民间人士率先创立了一年一度的活动庆祝代表人类崇高精神的文化1947年爱丁堡艺术节诞生了紧接其后的是阿维尼昂艺术节以及千千万万个新生的艺术节这些艺术节致力于呈现高水平的艺术同时明星艺术家例如Laurie AndersonMerce Cunningham 和 Robert Lepage年复一年地为艺术节奉上表演于是我们有了影响深远的演出&quot;The Mahabharata&quot;和里程碑式的&quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;
en:To understand this, I think it kind of makes senseto look where we&#39;ve come from.Modern arts festivals were bornin the rubble of World War II.Civic leaders created these annual eventsto celebrate culture as the highestexpression of the human spirit.In 1947, the Edinburgh Festival was bornand Avignon was born and hundreds of otherswould follow in their wake.The work they did was very, very high art,and stars came along like Laurie Andersonand Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepagewho made work for this circuit,and you had these seminal shows like &quot;The Mahabharata&quot;and the monumental &quot;Einstein on the Beach.&quot;

zh-cn:然而几十年过去了这类艺术节变成了一种文化根基尤其在这个文化与经济加速发展互联网使人们变得更加紧密的时代这类艺术节形式在各地不再常见全新的艺术节形式产生了
en:But as the decades passed,these festivals, they really became the establishment,and as the culture and capital accelerated,the Internet brought us all together,high and low kind of disappeared,a new kind of festival emerged.
时间： 3:30
zh-cn:传统的艺术节仍在发挥影响力但是从布灵顿到里约到珀斯艺术节不断在变化与创新它们是开放式的艺术节就像Minto一样体现了地方文化与世界文化交流的重要性它们之所以开放是因为它们邀请观众当演员，主角，合作伙伴，而不是做一个被动的围观者它们之所以开放是因为它们认识到想象不能被约束于高宇之内因此它们的表演大多安排在特殊的场地或户外
en:The old festivals, they continued to thrive, butfrom Brighton to Rio to Perth, something new was emerging,and these festivals were really different.They&#39;re open, these festivals, because, like in Minto,they understand that the dialoguebetween the local and the global is essential.They&#39;re open because they ask the audience to be a player,a protagonist, a partner, rather than a passive spectator,and they&#39;re open because they know that imaginationcannot be contained in buildings,and so much of the work they dois site-specific or outdoor work.

zh-cn:观众在这些新艺术节的邀请下在演出过程中扮演了非常重要的角色演出公司例如 De La Guarda, 我是它的制作人，以及Punchdrunk公司创造了这些令人大开眼界的表演形式他们把观众带入到舞台中间加入表演但是德国的 Rimini Protokoll 剧团则将这种表演形式发挥到了极致在一个系列秀中，包括“百分百温哥华””百分百柏林“Rimini Protokoll 制作的演出真实地反映了社会Rimini Protokoll 挑选了100个普通人代表同一时间里不同种族、性别、阶级的人他们从三个月前开始精心筹备演出他们挑中的100个人分享了他们自己的故事和人生经历这整个演出成为了一个城市的瞬间写照LIFT是善于利用场地策划演出的先锋他们认为戏剧与表演可以在任何地方出现你可以在教室里演出可以在机场里也可以在商店的橱窗里
en:So, the new festival, it asks the audience to playan essential role in shaping the performance.Companies like De La Guarda, which I produce, and Punchdrunkcreate these completely immersive experiencesthat put the audience at the center of the action,but the German performance company Rimini Protokolltakes this all to a whole new level.In a series of shows that includes &quot;100 Percent Vancouver,&quot;&quot;100 Percent Berlin,&quot; Rimini Protokoll makes showsthat actually reflect society.Rimini Protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that cityat that moment in terms of race and gender and class,through a careful process that begins three months before,and then those 100 people share stories aboutthemselves and their lives, and the whole thingbecomes a snapshot of that city at that moment.LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues.They understand that theater and performancecan happen anywhere.You can do a show in a schoolroom,in an airport, — (Laughter) —in a department store window.

zh-cn:艺术家是探索者，谁能比艺术家更能赋予城市新生？艺术家能带我们到一个城市遥远的一角那里我们从未探索过他们也能把我们带进一幢天天路过却从未进入的大楼
en:Artists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew?Artists can take us to a far-flung part of the citythat we haven&#39;t explored, or they can take us intothat building that we pass every day but we never went into.

zh-cn:我认为，艺术家能真正向我们展示生活中不曾注意的人Back to Back是一家澳大利亚剧团演员都是智障人士。我在纽约史泰登岛渡轮码头观看了他们精彩的演出高峰时段我们这些观众每人拿到一副耳机坐在码头的一边演员就在我们正前方在乘客中间我们可以听见他们但也许无法看出他们Back to Back采用特别外景剧场利用环境来提醒我们如何从日常生活中选择编辑人生的素材
en:An artist, I think, can really show us peoplethat we might overlook in our lives.Back to Back is an Australian company of peoplewith intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing showin New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminalat rush hour.We, the audience, were given headsets and seatedon one side of the terminal.The actors were right there in front of us,right there among the commuters,and we could hear them,but we might not have otherwise seen them.So Back to Back takes site-specific theater and uses itto gently remind us about who and what we chooseto edit out of our daily lives.

zh-cn:地方与全球的对话观众是参与者，是演员，是主人公场景的创造性运用，所有的一切构成了极为动人的作品这家奇迹般的法国剧团名为Royal de LuxeRoyal de Luxe让巨型人偶进驻城市住上几天
en:So, the dialogue with the local and the global,the audience as participant and player and protagonist,the innovative use of site, all of these thingscome to play in the amazing workof the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe.Royal de Luxe&#39;s giant puppets come into a cityand they live there for a few days.

zh-cn:为了“苏丹的大象”，Royal de Luxe剧团来到伦敦市中心驻扎他们演出一个巨型的小女孩和她的朋友一头穿越时空的大象几天后，他们把一个大都市转变成一个充满了无限可能的社区卫报写道：“如果艺术旨在转变，那就不会再有什么转变的体验。”“苏丹的大象”代表了对城市的艺术占领以及人类对街道主权的收回
en:For &quot;The Sultan&#39;s Elephant,&quot; Royal de Luxecame to central London and brought it to a standstillwith their story of a giant little girl and her friend,a time-traveling elephant.For a few days, they transformed a massive cityinto a community where endless possibility reigned.The Guardian wrote, &quot;If art is about transformation,then there can be no more transformative experience.What &#39;The Sultan&#39;s Elephant&#39; represents is no lessthan an artistic occupation of the cityand a reclamation of the streets for the people.&quot;

zh-cn:我们可以来探讨一下这些艺术节对各自城市的经济影响到我更加感兴趣的是其他的很多事艺术节如何帮助一个城市去表达自己找到自己的个性艺术节促进多样化的发展让邻居们开始对话提升了创造力激发了市民的自豪提升了我们整体上的心理幸福总而言之，艺术节能让城市生活更美好
en:We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivalson their cities, but I&#39;m much [more] interested in many more things,like how a festival helps a city to express itself,how it lets it come into its own.Festivals promote diversity,they bring neighbors into dialogue,they increase creativity,they offer opportunities for civic pride,they improve our general psychological well-being.In short, they make cities better places to live.

zh-cn:例证：当“苏丹的大象”来到伦敦7/7事件之后的九个月，一个伦敦人写道：“伦敦爆炸案后第一次，我从女儿的声音里再次听到了雀跃她打电话来说她跟朋友们一起去看了&#39;苏丹的大象&#39;，你们知道演出改变了一切卫报的林.加得纳写道一个伟大的艺术节向我们展示出一幅世界地图一幅城市地图，一幅我们自己的画像然而并不存在一个固定的艺术节模式我认为新颖艺术节的妙处在于它们真正完全抓住了我们现今生活方式的复杂和刺激非常感谢（掌声）
en:Case in point:When &quot;The Sultan&#39;s Elephant&quot; came to Londonjust nine months after 7/7, a Londoner wrote,&quot;For the first time since the London bombings,my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice.She had gathered with othersto watch &#39;The Sultan&#39;s Elephant,&#39; and, you know,it just made all the difference.&quot;Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has writtenthat a great festival can show us a map of the world,a map of the city and a map of ourselves,but there is no one fixed festival model.I think what&#39;s so brilliant about the festivals,the new festivals, is that they are really fully capturingthe complexity and the excitementof the way we all live today.Thank you very much. (Applause)
