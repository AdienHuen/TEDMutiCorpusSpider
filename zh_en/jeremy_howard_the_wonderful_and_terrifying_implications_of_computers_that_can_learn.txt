en:It used to be that if you wantedto get a computer to do something new,you would have to program it.Now, programming, for those of you herethat haven&#39;t done it yourself,requires laying out in excruciating detailevery single step that you wantthe computer to doin order to achieve your goal.Now, if you want to do somethingthat you don&#39;t know how to do yourself,then this is goingto be a great challenge.

en:So this was the challenge facedby this man, Arthur Samuel.In 1956, he wanted to get this computerto be able to beat him at checkers.How can you write a program,lay out in excruciating detail,how to be better than you at checkers?So he came up with an idea:he had the computer playagainst itself thousands of timesand learn how to play checkers.And indeed it worked,and in fact, by 1962,this computer had beatenthe Connecticut state champion.

zh-cn:亚瑟 塞缪尔是机器学习之父我非常敬畏他因为我是机器学习的实践者我曾是Kaggle的主席Kaggle是一个拥有200,000机器学习实践者地社区Kaggle会组织竞赛让人们尝试解决过去未解决的问题已成功解决问题几百次在这个有利环境中，我发现了机器学习在过去，现在，和将来可以做些什么第一个机器学习的商业成功案例应该是谷歌谷歌用计算机算法寻找信息而且这个算法以计算机学习为基础从那以后，机器学习得到了很多的商业成功像亚马逊、网飞这类公司通过机器学习向你推荐你可能想买的东西你可能想看的电影有时候你会被吓一跳像领英、脸谱这类的公司有时会告诉你谁会是你的朋友你根本不知道他们是如何做到的其实他们正是运用了机器学习的力量这种运算方法使用数据而非手动编写程序
en:So Arthur Samuel wasthe father of machine learning,and I have a great debt to him,because I am a machinelearning practitioner.I was the president of Kaggle,a community of over 200,000machine learning practictioners.Kaggle puts up competitionsto try and get them to solvepreviously unsolved problems,and it&#39;s been successful hundreds of times.So from this vantage point,I was able to find outa lot about what machine learningcan do in the past, can do today,and what it could do in the future.Perhaps the first big success of machine learning commercially was Google.Google showed that it ispossible to find informationby using a computer algorithm,and this algorithm is basedon machine learning.Since that time, there have been manycommercial successes of machine learning.Companies like Amazon and Netflixuse machine learning to suggestproducts that you might like to buy,movies that you might like to watch.Sometimes, it&#39;s almost creepy.Companies like LinkedIn and Facebooksometimes will tell you aboutwho your friends might beand you have no idea how it did it,and this is because it&#39;s usingthe power of machine learning.These are algorithms that havelearned how to do this from datarather than being programmed by hand.

en:So we now know that computers can learn,and computers can learn to do thingsthat we actually sometimesdon&#39;t know how to do ourselves,or maybe can do them better than us.One of the most amazing examplesI&#39;ve seen of machine learninghappened on a project that I ran at Kagglewhere a team run by a guycalled Geoffrey Hintonfrom the University of Torontowon a competition forautomatic drug discovery.Now, what was extraordinary hereis not just that they beatall of the algorithms developed by Merckor the international academic community,but nobody on the team had any backgroundin chemistry or biology or life sciences,and they did it in two weeks.How did they do this?They used an extraordinary algorithmcalled deep learning.So important was this that in factthe success was coveredin The New York Times in a front pagearticle a few weeks later.This is Geoffrey Hintonhere on the left-hand side.Deep learning is an algorithminspired by how the human brain works,and as a result it&#39;s an algorithmwhich has no theoretical limitationson what it can do.The more data you give it and the morecomputation time you give it,the better it gets.

zh-cn:深入学习就是这样神奇的事情这个单一的算法似乎可以做任何事情而且一年前我发现他甚至有视觉这个名不见经传的德国竞赛叫做德国交通标志识别基准深度学习已学得识别这些交通标识它不仅能够做的比其它算法好排行榜显示它比人更厉害是人的准确率的两倍到2011年，我们有了第一台视力高于人类的电脑从此更多的电脑也可以做到在2012年，谷歌宣布让一个深度学习的算法看YouTube视频收集16，000台电脑上的数据，为期一个月之后电脑便能仅通过看视频独立识别人和猫这近似于人类学习的过程人类不需要被告诉他们看到了什么而是在自己认知事物的过程中学习同样在2012年，杰弗里 辛顿，我们之前看到的人赢了很火的ImageNet比赛分辨出150万张图片的内容到2014年，我们已经将图像识别的误差降低到百分之六低于人类误差率
en:So deep learning isthis extraordinary thing.It&#39;s a single algorithm thatcan seem to do almost anything,and I discovered that a year earlier,it had also learned to see.In this obscure competition from Germanycalled the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark,deep learning had learnedto recognize traffic signs like this one.Not only could itrecognize the traffic signsbetter than any other algorithm,the leaderboard actually showedit was better than people,about twice as good as people.So by 2011, we had the first exampleof computers that can seebetter than people.Since that time, a lot has happened.In 2012, Google announced thatthey had a deep learning algorithmwatch YouTube videosand crunched the dataon 16,000 computers for a month,and the computer independently learnedabout concepts such as people and catsjust by watching the videos.This is much like the waythat humans learn.Humans don&#39;t learnby being told what they see,but by learning for themselveswhat these things are.Also in 2012, Geoffrey Hinton,who we saw earlier,won the very popular ImageNet competition,looking to try to figure out from one and a half million imageswhat they&#39;re pictures of.As of 2014, we&#39;re now downto a six percent error ratein image recognition.This is better than people, again.

en:So machines really are doingan extraordinarily good job of this,and it is now being used in industry.For example, Google announced last yearthat they had mapped every singlelocation in France in two hours,and the way they did it wasthat they fed street view imagesinto a deep learning algorithmto recognize and read street numbers.Imagine how longit would have taken before:dozens of people, many years.This is also happening in China.Baidu is kind of the Chinese Google, I guess,and what you see here in the top leftis an example of a picture that I uploadedto Baidu&#39;s deep learning system,and underneath you can see that the systemhas understood what that picture isand found similar images.The similar images actuallyhave similar backgrounds,similar directions of the faces,even some with their tongue out.This is not clearly lookingat the text of a web page.All I uploaded was an image.So we now have computers whichreally understand what they seeand can therefore search databasesof hundreds of millionsof images in real time.

en:So what does it meannow that computers can see?Well, it&#39;s not just that computers can see.In fact, deep learninghas done more than that.Complex, nuanced sentences like this oneare now understandablewith deep learning algorithms.As you can see here,this Stanford-based systemshowing the red dot at the tophas figured out that this sentenceis expressing negative sentiment.Deep learning now in factis near human performanceat understanding what sentences are aboutand what it is saying about those things.Also, deep learning hasbeen used to read Chinese,again at about nativeChinese speaker level.This algorithm developedout of Switzerlandby people, none of whom speakor understand any Chinese.As I say, using deep learningis about the best systemin the world for this,even compared to nativehuman understanding.

en:This is a system that weput together at my companywhich shows puttingall this stuff together.These are pictures whichhave no text attached,and as I&#39;m typing in here sentences,in real time it&#39;s understandingthese picturesand figuring out what they&#39;re aboutand finding pictures that are similarto the text that I&#39;m writing.So you can see, it&#39;s actuallyunderstanding my sentencesand actually understanding these pictures.I know that you&#39;ve seensomething like this on Google,where you can type in thingsand it will show you pictures,but actually what it&#39;s doing is it&#39;ssearching the webpage for the text.This is very different from actuallyunderstanding the images.This is something that computershave only been able to dofor the first time in the last few months.

en:So we can see now that computerscan not only see but they can also read,and, of course, we&#39;ve shown that theycan understand what they hear.Perhaps not surprising now thatI&#39;m going to tell you they can write.Here is some text that I generatedusing a deep learning algorithm yesterday.And here is some text that an algorithmout of Stanford generated.Each of these sentences was generatedby a deep learning algorithmto describe each of those pictures.This algorithm before has never seena man in a black shirt playing a guitar.It&#39;s seen a man before,it&#39;s seen black before,it&#39;s seen a guitar before,but it has independently generatedthis novel description of this picture.We&#39;re still not quite at humanperformance here, but we&#39;re close.In tests, humans preferthe computer-generated captionone out of four times.Now this system is now only two weeks old,so probably within the next year,the computer algorithm will bewell past human performanceat the rate things are going.So computers can also write.

zh-cn:我们把这些都放在一起，会发现一个令人兴奋的机遇比如说，在医药业一个波士顿团队宣布他们发现了肿瘤的几十种临床表现帮助医生预测癌症同样的，在斯坦福一个团队宣布通过用放大镜观察组织开发了一个基于机器学习的系统可以比病理学家更有效地预测癌症患者的幸存率在这两个例子中，不仅预测更加准确而且他们创造了新的科学视角在放射学中新视角是人类可以明白的新临床表现在病理学中电脑发现癌细胞周围的细胞在诊断中同癌细胞一样重要这和病理学家几十年来的教学是相反的这两个案例中的系统都是由医学专家和机器学习专家共同开发的去年我们就已经超过了这个水平这个是用显微镜识别组织癌变区的例子所显示的这个系统能够与病理学专家同样准确地识别癌变区甚至比病理专家更准确但是建立系统的都是深度学习的专家没有一个医学专家类似的，这是神经细胞分裂我们已经可以和人类一样准确地分裂细胞但这是个深度学习系统没有一个开发者拥有医学背景
en:So we put all this together and it leadsto very exciting opportunities.For example, in medicine,a team in Boston announcedthat they had discovereddozens of new clinically relevant featuresof tumors which help doctorsmake a prognosis of a cancer.Very similarly, in Stanford,a group there announced that,looking at tissues under magnification,they&#39;ve developed a machine learning-based systemwhich in fact is betterthan human pathologistsat predicting survival ratesfor cancer sufferers.In both of these cases, not onlywere the predictions more accurate,but they generated new insightful science.In the radiology case,they were new clinical indicatorsthat humans can understand.In this pathology case,the computer system actually discoveredthat the cells around the cancerare as important asthe cancer cells themselvesin making a diagnosis.This is the opposite of what pathologistshad been taught for decades.In each of those two cases,they were systems developedby a combination of medical expertsand machine learning experts,but as of last year,we&#39;re now beyond that too.This is an example ofidentifying cancerous areasof human tissue under a microscope.The system being shown herecan identify those areas more accurately,or about as accurately,as human pathologists,but was built entirely with deep learningusing no medical expertiseby people who haveno background in the field.Similarly, here, this neuron segmentation.We can now segment neuronsabout as accurately as humans can,but this system was developedwith deep learningusing people with no previous background in medicine.

en:So myself, as somebody withno previous background in medicine,I seem to be entirely well qualifiedto start a new medical company,which I did.I was kind of terrified of doing it,but the theory seemed to suggestthat it ought to be possibleto do very useful medicineusing just these data analytic techniques.And thankfully, the feedbackhas been fantastic,not just from the mediabut from the medical community,who have been very supportive.The theory is that we can takethe middle part of the medical processand turn that into data analysisas much as possible,leaving doctors to dowhat they&#39;re best at.I want to give you an example.It now takes us about 15 minutesto generate a new medical diagnostic testand I&#39;ll show you that in real time now,but I&#39;ve compressed it down to three minutes by cutting some pieces out.Rather than showing youcreating a medical diagnostic test,I&#39;m going to show you a diagnostic test of car images,because that&#39;s somethingwe can all understand.

zh-cn:现在我们有150万张汽车图片我想要根据拍照的角度对他们进行分类这些图片完全没有标签，所以我要先对他们进行简单描述有深度学习算法它可以自动识别图片的结构要素令人高兴的是人和电脑可以合作你可以看到，这个人正在告诉电脑什么是感兴趣的要素为之后电脑用来完善算法现在，这些深度学习算法处在16，000维空间中所以你看到电脑让他们在这个空间中旋转尝试找到新的结构要素当他成功时开车的人就可以指出感兴趣的要素现在电脑成功找出这些要素比如，角度我们在这个过程中逐渐的告诉电脑更多我们想寻找的结构你可以想象一个诊断测试这就像是病理学家识别病态区域或者放射学专家找出潜在的问题囊肿有时候这对算法来说有些难度我们的例子就比较麻烦车的正面和背面全部混淆了所以我们要仔细一些人工地选出正面和背面人后告诉电脑这是我们所感兴趣的一类
en:So here we&#39;re starting with about 1.5 million car images,and I want to create somethingthat can split them into the angleof the photo that&#39;s being taken.So these images are entirely unlabeled,so I have to start from scratch.With our deep learning algorithm,it can automatically identifyareas of structure in these images.So the nice thing is that the humanand the computer can now work together.So the human, as you can see here,is telling the computerabout areas of interestwhich it wants the computer thento try and use to improve its algorithm.Now, these deep learning systems actuallyare in 16,000-dimensional space,so you can see here the computerrotating this through that space,trying to find new areas of structure.And when it does so successfully,the human who is driving it can thenpoint out the areas that are interesting.So here, the computer hassuccessfully found areas,for example, angles.So as we go through this process,we&#39;re gradually tellingthe computer more and moreabout the kinds of structureswe&#39;re looking for.You can imagine in a diagnostic testthis would be a pathologist identifyingareas of pathosis, for example,or a radiologist indicatingpotentially troublesome nodules.And sometimes it can bedifficult for the algorithm.In this case, it got kind of confused.The fronts and the backsof the cars are all mixed up.So here we have to be a bit more careful,manually selecting these frontsas opposed to the backs,then telling the computerthat this is a type of groupthat we&#39;re interested in.

en:So we do that for a while,we skip over a little bit,and then we train themachine learning algorithmbased on these couple of hundred things,and we hope that it&#39;s gotten a lot better.You can see, it&#39;s now started to fadesome of these pictures out,showing us that it already is recognizinghow to understand some of these itself.We can then use this conceptof similar images,and using similar images, you can now see,the computer at this point is able toentirely find just the fronts of cars.So at this point, the humancan tell the computer,okay, yes, you&#39;ve donea good job of that.

zh-cn:当然，有时，即使在这个阶段分组仍然是很困难的像我们这里，让电脑在这里旋转了一段时间了我们还是看到左面的和右面的图片有混淆所以我们可以再一次给电脑一些提示我们让它通过深度学习算法尽可能分离出左面和右面的图片有了这个指示——好的，它已经完成了它要想办法分开这一部分
en:Sometimes, of course, even at this pointit&#39;s still difficultto separate out groups.In this case, even after we let thecomputer try to rotate this for a while,we still find that the left sidesand the right sides picturesare all mixed up together.So we can again givethe computer some hints,and we say, okay, try and finda projection that separates outthe left sides and the right sidesas much as possibleusing this deep learning algorithm.And giving it that hint —ah, okay, it&#39;s been successful.It&#39;s managed to find a wayof thinking about these objectsthat&#39;s separated out these together.

en:So this process takes aboutfour or five iterations.You can see we now have 62 percentof our 1.5 million images classified correctly.And at this point, wecan start to quite quicklygrab whole big sections,check through them to make surethat there&#39;s no mistakes.Where there are mistakes, we canlet the computer know about them.And using this kind of processfor each of the different groups,we are now up toan 80 percent success ratein classifying the 1.5 million images.And at this point, it&#39;s just a caseof finding the small numberthat aren&#39;t classified correctly,and trying to understand why.And using that approach,by 15 minutes we getto 97 percent classification rates.
