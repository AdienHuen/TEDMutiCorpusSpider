zh-cn:我这辈子与汽车的不解之缘既是与生俱来又是个人的选择过去30年里我一直在福特汽车公司工作过去我关心的总是如何把更多的汽车卖出去而今天我所担心的是如果我们所做的仅仅只是卖出更多的汽车如果路上的车辆数量翻了一倍，两倍，甚至三倍会有什么后果？
en:By birth and by choice,I&#39;ve been involved with the auto industry my entire life,and for the past 30 years,I&#39;ve worked at Ford Motor Company.And for most of those years,I worried about,how am I going to sell more cars and trucks?But today I worry about,what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?What happenswhen the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples,or even quadruples?

zh-cn:我一生所钟爱的有两样事物第一样就是汽车我其实就是在福特汽车公司里长大的儿时当父亲把最新版的福特或林肯车开回家，停在路边我觉得这真是太酷了十岁的时候我下定决心要是我能当上测试驾驶员，那该多好啊我的父母去吃晚餐的时候等他们一坐下来，我就偷偷溜出去跳上驾驶座，开着新车到路上遛弯真是太过瘾了就这么过了两年直到—我大概12岁—我父亲把一辆林肯MarkIII开回家那一天正好下雪他和妈妈去吃晚餐我就溜了出去我想在雪里转几个圈再走几个8字，应该会很酷我父亲当晚提早吃好了晚餐他走到前厅走到前门与此同时，我的车撞上了一块冰冲到了前门，被他撞个正着还差点冲进前厅这次经历让我的试车生涯暂告一段落但从那以后我真正地爱上了汽车我的第一辆车就是1975年产的电光绿野马尽管颜色相当难看但我非常喜爱这辆车它实实在在地奠定了我对车的迷恋这种感情延续至今
en:My life is guided by two great passions,and the first is automobiles.I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.I thought it was so cool as a little boywhen my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincolnand leave it in the driveway.And I decided about that time, about age 10,that it would be really cool if I was a test driver.So my parents would go to dinner.They&#39;d sit down; I&#39;d sneak out of the house.I&#39;d jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway,and it was a blast.And that went on for about two years,until — I think I was about 12 —my dad brought homea Lincoln Mark III.And it was snowing that day.So he and mom went to dinner,and I snuck outand thought it&#39;d be really cool to do donutsor even some figure-eights in the snow.My dad finished dinner early that evening.And he was walking to the front halland out the front doorjust about the same time I hit some iceand met him at the front door with the car —and almost ended up in the front hall.So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.But I really began to love cars then.And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.And even though the color was pretty hideous,I did love the car,and it really cemented my love affair with carsthat&#39;s continued on to this day.

zh-cn:汽车不仅仅是我所喜爱的事物我跟它们的缘分是与生俱来的我的曾祖父就是亨利.福特而在我母亲那边我的曾外公就是哈卫.凡士通我一出生就肩负众望而我的曾祖父亨利.福特坚定地相信福特汽车公司的使命就是让人们的生活更美好让所有人都买得起车他相信，有了动力就有了自由和进步我也是这么相信的
en:But cars are really more than a passion of mine;they&#39;re quite literally in my blood.My great grandfather was Henry Ford,and on my mother&#39;s side,my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.So when I was born,I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.But my great grandfather, Henry Ford,really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Companywas to make people&#39;s lives betterand make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.Because he believed that with mobilitycomes freedom and progress.And that&#39;s a belief that I share.

zh-cn:而我热爱的第二样事物就是环境我曾去过密歇根州北部在海明威钓过鱼的地方钓鱼他后来在书上写到过这里多年之后这里的变化让我感到震惊我曾去到我喜爱的小溪步行穿越那片飞满了萤火虫的田地而现在那里变成了商场或公寓区因此即使当时我还年少这还是给了我很大的震动保护环境的基本意识就在我内心扎根了
en:My other great passion is the environment.And as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michiganand fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished inand then later wrote about.And it really struck meas the years went by,in a very negative way,when I would go to some stream that I&#39;d loved,and was used to walking through this fieldthat was once filled with fireflies,and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.And so even at a young age,that really resonated with me,and the whole notion of environmental preservation,at a very basic level, sunk in with me.

zh-cn:上高中后，我开始阅读梭罗，阿尔多.李奥帕德和爱德华.艾比等作家的书我对于自然世界萌生了更深层次的感情我从来没有想过我对汽车和卡车的挚爱竟然会与自然相冲突我的确是这样认为的直到我上了大学初到大学，你们可以想象得到我的惊讶上课时教授们会说美国之所以出现问题全都是福特汽车公司以及我们家族的责任他们认为我们注重的是整个行业是否赚钱而不是进步是我们让天空乌烟瘴气我们是国家的大敌
en:As a high-schooler, I started to readauthors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopoldand Edward Abbey,and I really began to developa deeper appreciation of the natural world.But it never really occurred to methat my love of cars and truckswould ever be in conflict with nature.And that was trueuntil I got to college.And when I got to college, you can imagine my surprisewhen I would go to classand a number of my professors would saythat Ford Motor Company and my familywas everything that was wrong with our country.They thought that we were more interested, as an industry,in profits, rather than progress,and that we filled the skies with smog —and frankly, we were the enemy.

zh-cn:大学毕业后我进入了福特公司在此之前我对此举是否明智做了一些思想斗争而我最终决定进入公司看看是否能够做出改变回想三十年前曾认为自己有这个能力这实在有些天真，但我的确有这个志愿我也发现教授们所说的并不全是错的实际上，我回到底特律后发现我的公司以及行业中的其它公司对我的环保倾向并不欢迎你可以想象到我碰到了一些非常有趣的对话福特公司里的一些人认为这些保护环境的废话应被禁止我也应当停止与“环保狂人”来往我被认为是一名激进分子我永远忘不了那一天我被某管理高层叫到办公室被要求停止与任何已知或疑似环保人士为伍（众人笑）当然，我并没有理会我还是坚持倡导保护环境这就是我们今天所谈论的可持续性现在，我的观点从饱受非议变成多少为众人所接受我是说，我认为行业中大多数人都明白我们必须采取行动了
en:I joined Ford after college,after some soul searchingwhether or not this is really the right thing to do.But I decided that I wanted to goand see if I could affect change there.And as I look back over 30 years ago,it was a little naive to think at that agethat I could. But I wanted to.And I really discoveredthat my professors weren&#39;t completely wrong.In fact, when I got back to Detroit,my environmental leanings weren&#39;t exactly embracedby those in my own company,and certainly by those in the industry.I had some very interesting conversations,as you can imagine.There were some within Fordwho believed that all this ecological nonsenseshould just disappearand that I needed to stop hanging outwith &quot;environmental wackos.&quot;I was considered a radical.And I&#39;ll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top managementand told to stop associatingwith any known or suspected environmentalists.(Laughter)Of course, I had no intention of doing that,and I kept speaking out about the environment,and it really was the topicthat we now today call sustainability.And in time, my views went from controversialto more or less consensus today.I mean, I think most people in the industryunderstand that we&#39;ve got to get on with it.

zh-cn:好消息是，我们现正在设法解决关于汽车与环境的大问题－－不仅是福特，全行业都是如此我们将燃料效能推向新的高度通过使用新技术我们正在减少－－我相信，总有一天，能够消灭－－二氧化碳尾气我们开始销售电动汽车，这非常好同时开发新动力传送器让所有车变得经济实惠无论从经济上，社会上还是环境上来说事实上，尽管我们的工作任重道远我依然能够预见到我热衷的两项事业－－汽车和环境－－和谐发展的一天
en:And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues,of cars and the environment —not only at Ford, but really as an industry.We&#39;re pushing fuel efficiency to new heights.And with new technology,we&#39;re reducing — and I believe, someday we&#39;ll eliminate —CO2 emissions.We&#39;re starting to sell electric cars, which is great.We&#39;re developing alternative powertrainsthat are going to make cars affordablein every sense of the word —economically, sociallyand environmentally.And actually, although we&#39;ve got a long way to goand a lot of work to do,I can see the day where my two great passions —cars and the environment —actually come into harmony.

zh-cn:可惜的是尽管我们正在解决这一个重大的问题－－正如我所说的，我们还有很长的路要走但我能预见到我们会达到－－即使我们正在为此努力另一个重大的问题开始威胁我们而人们还没有注意到我曾祖父为世人带来的出行自由正如环境一样受到威胁这个问题，用最简单的方式表述就是一个数学问题今天全球人口大约68亿在我们有生之年，这个数字将上升至90亿在这样的人口水平下我们的地球将面临发展的限制这样的人口增长将导致一些严重的现实问题其中一个问题就是交通系统无法承受人口负重
en:But unfortunately,as we&#39;re on our way to solving one monstrous problem —and as I said, we&#39;re not there yet; we&#39;ve got a lot of work to do,but I can see where we will —but even as we&#39;re in the process of doing that,another huge problem is looming,and people aren&#39;t noticing.And that is the freedom of mobilitythat my great grandfather brought to peopleis now being threatened, just as the environment is.The problem, put in its simplest terms,is one of mathematics.Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world,and within our lifetime, that number&#39;s going to growto about nine billion.And at that population level,our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.And with that growthcomes some severe practical problems,one of which is our transportation systemsimply won&#39;t be able to deal with it.

zh-cn:如果我们把人口增长和汽车联系起来看情况就更明了了全球目前大约有8亿辆车行驶在路上全球人口越多发展得越兴盛到了本世纪中叶这个数字将增长至20亿至40亿辆车这将造成空前的全球交通大拥堵想象一下这对我们的日常生活会有什么影响现今平均每个美国人每年有将近一周的时间花在了堵车上这浪费了大量的时间和资源这还不算什么那些发展最快的国家情况比这严重得多在北京，每个司机每天花在路上的平均时间是五个小时去年夏天－－你们很多人可以已经看到这消息－－中国有一次花了11天才疏通了长达100英里的交通大拥堵在未来的几十年后全球75%的人口将生活在城市里其中的50多个城市人口将超过一亿人
en:When we look at the population growth in terms of cars,it becomes even clearer.Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.But with more peopleand greater prosperity around the world,that number&#39;s going to growto between two and four billion cars by mid century.And this is going to create the kind of global gridlockthat the world has never seen before.Now think about the impactthat this is going to have on our daily lives.Today the average Americanspends about a week a yearstuck in traffic jams,and that&#39;s a huge waste of time and resources.But that&#39;s nothing comparedto what&#39;s going onin the nations that are growing the fastest.Today the average driver in Beijinghas a five-hour commute.And last summer — many of you probably saw this —there was a hundred-mile traffic jamthat took 11 days to clear in China.In the decades to come,75 percent of the world&#39;s populationwill live in cities,and 50 of those citieswill be of 10 million people or more.

zh-cn:你们可以看到我们面临问题有多大了如果你把人口问题考虑进去就不难看到，我们今天拥有的移动模式在将来是行不通的很显然，四十亿辆环保车行驶在路上仍旧是四十亿辆车啊没有废气的交通拥堵仍旧是交通拥堵啊如果我们今天不做出改变明天怎么办？我想你们可能已经心里有数了交通拥堵只是这个挑战的一个症状堵车是非常不方便的堵车就会带来不便而更大的问题是全球的交通拥堵将严重威胁经济增长扼杀我们运输食物提供医疗服务的能力尤其是向生活在城市中心的人们我们的生活质量将被大打折扣有什么解决方法呢？
en:So you can see the size of the issue that we&#39;re facing.When you factor in population growth,it&#39;s clear that the mobility model that we have todaysimply will not work tomorrow.Frankly, four billion clean cars on the roadare still four billion cars,and a traffic jam with no emissionsis still a traffic jam.So, if we make no changes today,what does tomorrow look like?Well I think you probably already have the picture.Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge,and they&#39;re really very, very inconvenient,but that&#39;s all they are.But the bigger issueis that global gridlockis going to stifle economic growthand our ability to deliverfood and health care,particularly to people that live in city centers.And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.So what&#39;s going to solve this?

zh-cn:答案可能不尽相同在发明T型车之前我曾祖父曾说“如果我问当时的人们它们想要什么他们会回答‘我们想要跑得更快的马’”所以，更多车辆的问题不能通过修更多的路来解决当美国开始西进运动时我们并没有添置更多的大篷车而是建了铁路在二战后，为了连通国家交通网我们并没有建双向高速公路而是建了州际高速公路体系现在我们需要在思想上实现相同的跳跃以创造一个坚实的未来我们要制造智能汽车我们也要制造智能道路，智能停车位智能公共运输系统等等我们不想把时间浪费在堵车，收费站或寻找停车位上我们需要一个综合体系采用实时数据优化大范围的个人移动性保证出行者行动不受影响不打折口显然，这样的体系才能够保证未来个人行动自由的可持续性
en:Well the answer isn&#39;t going to be more of the same.My great grandfather once saidbefore he invented the Model T,&quot;If I had asked people then what they wanted,they would have answered,&#39;We want faster horses.&#39;&quot;So the answer to more carsis simply not to have more roads.When America began moving west,we didn&#39;t add more wagon trains,we built railroads.And to connect our country after World War II,we didn&#39;t build more two-lane highways,we built the interstate highway system.Today we need that same leap in thinkingfor us to create a viable future.We are going to build smart cars,but we also need to buildsmart roads, smart parking,smart public transportation systems and more.We don&#39;t want to waste our timesitting in traffic, sitting at tollboothsor looking for parking spots.We need an integrated systemthat uses real time datato optimize personal mobility on a massive scalewithout hassle or compromises for travelers.And frankly, that&#39;s the kind of systemthat&#39;s going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable.

zh-cn:值得高兴的是，这项工作在世界的不同地方已经开工了阿布扎比市的玛斯达尔采用能够相互沟通的无人驾驶电动车它们在城市街道的地下行动而在地上是一系列人行道纽约市的34号大街将堵车取而代之的是一个四通八达的车辆专用通道系统人行区和专用交通通道将被建起这一切都将把纽约市交通拥堵高峰期平均时间从现在的1个小时缩短到20分钟你们看香港他们有一套有意思的系统，被称为“八达通”这个系统将所有交通资产统一到一个单独的支付系统这样，停车场，公车，火车都在同一个系统下运行现在拼车服务在全世界也遍地开花了我认为，这些行动都非常好它们缓解了交通拥堵当然也帮助节省了一些燃油
en:Now the good news is some of this work has already begunin different parts of the world.The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabiuses driverless electric vehiclesthat can communicate with one another,and they go underneath the city streets.And up above, you&#39;ve got a series of pedestrian walkways.On New York City&#39;s 34th Street,gridlock will soon be replacedwith a connected systemof vehicle-specific corridors.Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created,and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commuteto get across town in New Yorkfrom about an hour today at rush hourto about 20 minutes.Now if you look at Hong Kong,they have a very interesting system called Octopus there.It&#39;s a system that really ties togetherall the transportation assetsinto a single payment system.So parking garages, buses, trains,they all operate within the same system.Now shared car servicesare also springing up around the world,and these efforts, I think, are great.They&#39;re relieving congestion,and they&#39;re frankly starting to save some fuel.

zh-cn:这些都是十分棒的想法能够推动我们的进步而真正给我启发的是当我们的车开始相互交谈会是什么情况很快，我们今天使用的将音乐、娱乐和GPS信息嵌入车辆的这个系统将被用于建设一个智能车辆网络每天早晨我从安娜堡的家开车30英里去到我在密歇根州迪尔伯恩的办公室每天晚上我回家的路途总是被堵得水泄不通我常常不得不离开高速路另找其它出路才能回到家但很快，我们就能看到汽车相互沟通的那一天如果在我前面的一辆车在I-94号路上遇到塞车它就会立即通知我的车让我的车另寻出路这样我就能找到回家的最佳路径这些系统都在接受测试它们很快就会被正式投入运行
en:These are all really good ideasthat will move us forward.But what really inspires meis what&#39;s going to be possiblewhen our cars can begin talking to each other.Very soon, the same systems that we use todayto bring music and entertainmentand GPS information into our vehiclesare going to be used to createa smart vehicle network.Every morning I drive about 30 milesfrom my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.And every night I go home,my commute is a total crapshoot.And I often have to leave the freewayand look for different waysfor me to try and make it home.But very soon we&#39;re going to see the dayswhen cars are essentially talking to each other.So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic,it will immediately alert my carand tell my car to reroute itselfto get me home in the best possible way.And these systems are being tested right now,and frankly they&#39;re going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.

zh-cn:车辆连接网络的潜力几乎是无限的试想一下在不久的将来你们能够在市中心计划行程而你的车就会被接入一个智能停车系统接着，你上了车就在此时你的车在你到达之前为你预定一个停车位－－无需开着车到处找了开车找停车位无疑是城市车辆耗油最多的一方面或者试想一下在纽约市里用智能电话定位一辆智能出租车这样你就无需在冷风中苦苦等候了或试想一下，你参加未来的TED会议时你的车把在座各位的日程表一查挑选你们最佳的回家路径而在离开时你们都能够准时地到达下一个目的地这样的科技能够将几百万辆车统一到一个独立的体系中
en:But the potential of a connected car networkis almost limitless.So just imagine:one day very soon,you&#39;re going to be able to plan a trip downtownand your car will be connected to a smart parking system.So you get in your car,and as you get in your car,your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive —no more driving around looking for one,which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuelin today&#39;s cars in urban areas —is looking for parking spots.Or think about being in New York Cityand tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phoneso you don&#39;t have to wait in the cold to hail one.Or being at a future TED Conferenceand having your cartalk to the calendars of everybody hereand telling you all the best route to take homeand when you should leaveso that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.This is the kind of technologythat will merge millions of individual vehiclesinto a single system.

zh-cn:很显然，我们已经有了解决这个大问题的初步方案但是在我们应对二氧化碳排放问题和燃料问题时发现问题的解决并不是一蹴而就的解决方案并不是使用更多的汽车，建设更多道路或新的铁路系统；解决问题的关键，我认为在这样一个全球网络中解决方案都互相关联我知道我们能够研发出这样的技术使得这一切成为现实我们也愿意去寻找解决方案－－不论是使用拼车或公共交通或其它我们还未想到的方法我们的整体交通组合和基础设施必须为未来的解决方案服务
en:So I think it&#39;s clear we have the beginnings of a solutionto this enormous problem.But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues,and also fossil fuels,there is no one silver bullet.The solution is not going to bemore cars, more roads or a new rail system;it can only be found, I believe,in a global networkof interconnected solutions.Now I know we can develop the technologythat&#39;s going to make this work,but we&#39;ve got to be willing to get out thereand seek out the solutions —whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportationor some other way we haven&#39;t even thought of yet;our overall transportation-mix and infrastructuremust support all the future options.

en:We need our best and our brightestto start entertaining this issue.Companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists,they all need to understandthis is a huge business opportunity,as well as an enormous social problem.And just as these groupsembrace the green energy challenge —and it&#39;s really been amazing to me to watchhow much brain power, how much moneyand how much serious thoughthas, really over the last three years,just poured into the green energy field.We need that same kind of passion and energyto attack global gridlock.But we need people like all of you in this room,leading thinkers.I mean, frankly, I need all of youto think about howyou can help solve this huge issue.And we need people from all walks of life;not just inventors, we need policymakersand government officialsto also think about how they&#39;re going to respond to this challenge.

en:This isn&#39;t going to be solvedby any one person or one group.It&#39;s going to really require a national energy policy,frankly for each country,because the solutions in each country are going to be differentbased upon income levels, traffic jamsand also how integratedthe systems already are.But we need to get going, and we need to get going today.And we must have an infrastructurethat&#39;s designed to supportthis flexible future.

en:You know, we&#39;ve come a long way.Since the Model T,most people never traveledmore than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.And since then,the automobile has allowed us the freedomto choose where we live, where we work,where we playand frankly when we just go out and want to move around.We don&#39;t want to regress and lose that freedom.We&#39;re on our way to solving —and as I said earlier, I know we&#39;ve got a long way to go —the one big issue that we&#39;re all focused on that threatens it,and that&#39;s the environmental issue,but I believe we all must turnall of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determinationto help now solve this notion of global gridlock.Because in doing so,we&#39;re going to preserve what we&#39;ve really come to take for granted,which is the freedom to moveand move very effortlessly around the world.And it frankly will enhance our quality of lifeif we fix this.Because, if you can envision, as I do,a future of zero emissionsand freedom to move around the country and around the worldlike we take for granted today,that&#39;s worth the hard work todayto preserve that for tomorrow.
