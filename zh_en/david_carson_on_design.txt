zh-cn:我坚持要用幻灯机非常坚决，直到差不多几天前还是但在最后关头他们说不行(笑）这无非让我对幻灯片更有感触了（笑）也更亲密幻灯机的好处在于你能调整幻灯片的聚焦不像PowerPoint那些软件我必须得说我们别无选择的－－得做点妥协你知道，要是用幻灯机的话你就没法看到难看的字体从后面或者侧面飞出来，或者从上到下，但也许这个妥协还算划算换来我们没法聚焦（笑）这就是我的一个想法，一个想法而已其实幻灯片卡住也是挺妙的一件事而你最期待的其实是它们时不时能着火不过今晚我们是没这个眼福了
en:I had requested slides,kind of adamantly,up till the — pretty much, last few days,but was denied access to a slide projector.(Laughter)I actually find them a lot more emotional —(Laughter)— and personal,and the neat thing about a slide projectoris you can actually focus the work,unlike PowerPoint and some other programs.Now, I agree thatyou have to — yeah, there are certain concessionsand, you know, if you use a slide projector,you&#39;re not able to have the bad typeswing in from the back or the side, or up or down,but maybe that&#39;s an O.K. trade-off,to trade that off for a focus.(Laughter)It&#39;s a thought. Just a thought.And there&#39;s something nice about slides getting stuck.And the thing you really hope foris occasionally they burn up,which we won&#39;t see tonight. So.

zh-cn:那我们就这么开始第一张图片吧这个东西，有些人已经猜到了是一个不久前在葡萄牙被喝光的啤酒罐（笑）这个－－是我第一次来巴塞罗那我想－－你知道，飞了一晚上，我抬头一看对自己说，哇哦，多么简洁你来到这么个大机场，居然就只有一个B我是说，这多棒啊！设计界里的一切都变得简洁这么大的一个超级机场我的天，我就－－我就拍了一张照片我想，上帝啊，这是我这辈子在机场见过的最酷的事直到几个月前我又回到同一个机场－－同一班飞机，我想－－然后我抬头一看上面写着，C（大笑）到那一刻我才明白它只不过是个通关的门而已（笑）
en:With that, let&#39;s get the first slide up here.This, as many of you have probably guessed,is arecently emptied beer can in Portugal.(Laughter)This — I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time,and I thought —you know, fly all night, I looked up,and I thought, wow, how clean.You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.I mean, how nice is that?Everything&#39;s gotten simpler in design,and here&#39;s this mega airport,and God, I just — I took a picture.I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I&#39;ve ever seen at an airport.Till a couple months later,I went back to the same airport —same plane, I think — and looked up,and it said C.(Laughter)It was only then that I realizedit was simply a gate that I was coming into.(Laughter)

zh-cn:我极其信仰设计中酝酿的情绪和它传达出来的信息在有人开始读之前在他们读完余下的信息时他们在情绪上如何回应这个设计这个故事，这幅画－－不管它是什么这个领域里的设计最能吸引我我觉得这个例子非常清楚非常简明地解释了我在说什么这是一组车库门，被刷上了相同的东西紧挨着。这个呢，是第一扇门。你一眼就明白它是什么意思你知道，它写得很一清二楚再看一下第二扇门看看有什么不同之处好，你们想在哪扇前面停车？（笑）一样的颜色，一样的讯息，一样的措词唯一不同的是门主人在其中赋予的情绪－－再想一下，哪个人是精神分裂杀人狂？（笑）然而它没写出来，它也不需要写出来我想我会停在另外一家门前
en:I&#39;m a big believer in the emotion of design,and the message that&#39;s sentbefore somebody begins to read,before they get the rest of the information;what is the emotional response they get to the product,to the story, to the painting — whatever it is.That area of design interests me the most,and I think this for me is a real clear,very simplified versionof what I&#39;m talking about.These are a couple of garage doors painted identical,situated next to each other.So, here&#39;s the first door. You know, you get the message.You know, it&#39;s pretty clear.Take a look at the second door and seeif there&#39;s any different message.O.K., which one would you park in front of?(Laughter)Same color, same message, same words.The only thing that&#39;s differentis the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece —and, again,which is the psycho-killer here?(Laughter)Yet it doesn&#39;t say that; it doesn&#39;t need to say that.I would probably park in front of the other one.

zh-cn:我相信很多人已经发现这几年平面设计变得越来越简洁在最近五年左右它变得如此简洁，以至于现在有点开始有反弹的趋势，变得开始表达自我但我在米兰的时候，我看到这个街牌我非常高兴地发现这种“极简主义”甚至被一位涂鸦艺术家作了诠释（笑）这位涂鸦艺术家来到这，只是稍稍完善了一下这牌子，就转向了别处（笑）他没像以往那样想要主导它（笑）
en:I&#39;m sure a lot of you are awarethat graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the lastfive years or so.It&#39;s gotten so simple that it&#39;s already starting to kind ofcome back the other way again and get a little more expressive.But I was in Milan and saw this street sign,and was very happy tosee that apparently this idea of minimalismhas even been translated by the graffiti artist.(Laughter)And this graffiti artist has come along,made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.(Laughter)He didn&#39;t overpower it like they have a tendency to do.(Laughter)

zh-cn:这是Metropolis的一本书我照了几张照片，这张是佛罗里达州的一个广告牌要么是他们没交租金要么他们不想再租这块牌子了管这广告牌的人懒到不想把整块牌子拆下来所以他们就拆了其中的一部分我倒是觉得这么做可能比原来的广告更能引起你的注意把你的眼球吸引过去但愿你们不会就此去买那些难吃的核桃东西－－Stuckey&#39;s
en:This is for a book by &quot;Metropolis.&quot;I took some photos, and this isa billboard in Florida,and either they hadn&#39;t paid their rent,or they didn&#39;t want to pay their rent again on the sign,and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down,so they just teared out sections of it.And I would argue that it&#39;s possibly more effectivethan the original billboard in terms of getting your attention,getting you to look over that way.And hopefully you don&#39;t stop and buy those awful pecan things — Stuckey&#39;s.

zh-cn:这是我第二本书中的第一本叫“印刷的终结”和它一起还出了一部电影和William Burroughs合作的“印刷的终结”已经在印第五版了（笑）我刚开始联系William Burrows商讨参与制作的时候他说不行－－他不相信这会是印刷的终结然后我说，那好吧我只是很希望你能给这部电影和书带来影响最后他终于同意了在电影的最后，他用富有磁性的声音说我没法学上来，我尽量试试，但不太可能，他说“我记得去参加一个展览，叫做‘摄影：绘画的终结’ ”然后他说，“当然，这没成为现实。“所以，当摄影技术发展到精湛时就会有人说你看吧，你把绘画给毁了现在人们就直接去用相机了当然了，这也是谬论
en:This is from my second book.The first book is called, &quot;The End of Print,&quot;and it was done along with a film,working with William Burroughs.And &quot;The End of Print&quot; is now in its fifth printing.(Laughter)When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it,he said no; he said he didn&#39;t believe it was the end of print.And I said, well, that&#39;s fine;I just would love to have your input on this film and this book,and he finally agreed to it.And at the end of the film, he says in this great voicethat I can&#39;t mimic but I&#39;ll kind of try, but not really, he says,&quot;I remember attending an exhibition called,&#39;Photography: The End of Painting.&#39;&quot;And then he says, &quot;And, of course, it wasn&#39;t at all.&quot;So, apparently when photography was perfected,there were people going around saying,that&#39;s it: you&#39;ve just ruined painting.People are just going to take pictures now.And of course, that wasn&#39;t the case.

zh-cn:所以，这是“第二视觉”我的一本关于直觉的书我觉得它并不是设计中唯一的元素但有可能是最重要的每个人都有直觉它是没法传授的事实上，大多数流派把它忽略了它在工作过程中的重要因为他们没办法量化它教人们“直觉的三步入门”是件很难的事但我们能教你“做好看名片的三步入门”或者做业务简报所以它就被渐渐忽略了这里有一句爱因斯坦的名言，他说，“在探索的路上，智慧帮不上什么忙，只有当你灵光一现时－－叫它直觉，或任何名称－－答案自动跑到你身边来，你不知道它从哪里来，也不知道为什么。”这有点像当有个人说，这首歌是谁写的？你越努力地想答案就离你越远一旦当你不再去想时直觉能给你答案，某种意义上
en:So, this is from &quot;2nd Sight,&quot;a book I did on intuition.I think it&#39;s not the only ingredient in design,but possibly the most important.It&#39;s something everybody has.It&#39;s not a matter of teaching it;in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuitionas an ingredient of your working processbecause they can&#39;t quantify it:it&#39;s very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design,but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business cardor a newsletter.So it tends to get discounted.This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says,&quot;The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.There comes a leap in consciousness —call it intuition or what you will —and the solution just comes to you, and you don&#39;t know from where or why.&quot;So, it&#39;s kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?And the more you try to think about it,the further the answer gets from you,and the minute you stop thinking about it,your intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.

zh-cn:我喜欢这个有几个原因如果你上过任何设计课的话，他们会告诉你这个没法读我认为到最后你肯定读得出来，更重要的是，我觉得它说得没错“别认为清晰就是沟通。”一个东西很清楚，并不代表它能交流更重要地是，这也不代表它表述了正确的讯息所以，在人们仔细读下去之前，他们接收到的讯息是什么？我觉得这个方面常常被忽略了
en:I like this for a couple of reasons.If you&#39;ve had any design courses, they would teach you you can&#39;t read this.I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it&#39;s true.&quot;Don&#39;t mistake legibility for communication.&quot;Just because something&#39;s legible doesn&#39;t means it communicates.More importantly, it doesn&#39;t mean it communicates the right thing.So, what is the message sent beforesomebody actually gets into the material?And I think that&#39;s sometimes an overlooked area.

zh-cn:这是和Marshall McLuhan的合作我和他的妻子和儿子一起收集了差不多600句Marshall的妙语它们不可思议地超越时代预言了极多之后发生的事在广告，电视，传媒等领域里以至这本书被人称作“箴言”，它是“妙语”的另外一种说法它－－其中很多一直没有被出版基本上，我诠释过很多“妙语”这个呢，是最初内容页的设计我完稿时有540页而出版社Gingko Press最后把它作了大幅删减现在它只剩下不到400页但我决定我喜欢这个内容页我喜欢它看上去的感觉－－所以我它留下了（笑）它和书的内容一点关系也没有但我想，它当插页挺好看（笑）
en:This is working with Marshall McLuhan.I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric,and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshallthat are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times,predicting so much of what has happenedin the advertising, television, media world.And so this book is called &quot;Probes.&quot; It&#39;s another word for quotes.And it&#39;s — a lot of them are never — have never been published before,and basically, I&#39;ve interpreted the different quotes.So, this was the contents page originally.When I got done it was 540 pages,and then the publisher, Gingko Press,ended up cutting it down considerably:it&#39;s just under 400 pages now.But I decided I liked this contents page —I liked the way it looks — so I kept it.(Laughter)It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever,but it&#39;s a nice spread, I think, in there.(Laughter)

zh-cn:这是书中另外一些插页在这里McLuhan说到“新的传媒不是连接人和大自然的桥梁；它们就是自然。”“印刷的发明和匿名是分开的滋养了“文学名声”的概念还有把智慧当成私人财产的习惯这在印刷术之前是没听过的“当新技术把自己强加在一个早就习惯旧有技术的社会时，各式的焦躁开始了。”“当人们埋头于创造一个全新的世界时，他们眼前总会清晰浮现之前的世界。”我讨厌这些东西，一点都看不清楚。（笑）（掌声）“在电子时代的人们除了全球化以外没有其他环境，除了信息收集以外也没有任何工作机会。”就这样了，他觉得可选择的就这些。这与现实差不多吧。
en:So, a couple spreads from the book:here McLuhan says,&quot;The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature.&quot;&quot;The invention of printing did away with anonymity,fostering ideas of literary fameand the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property,&quot;which had never been done before printing.&quot;When new technologies impose themselveson societies long habituated to older technologies,anxieties of all kinds result.&quot;&quot;While people are engaged in creating a totally different world,they always form vivid images of the preceding world.&quot;I hate this stuff. It&#39;s hard to read.(Laughter)(Applause)&quot;People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe,and no possible occupation except information gathering.&quot;That was it. That&#39;s all he saw as the options. And not too far off.

en:So, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden,and it was done right after 9/11.And I had recently discovered a bomb shelterin the backyard of a house I had bought in LAthat the real estate person hadn&#39;t pointed out.(Laughter)There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the &#39;60s Cuban missile crisis.And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by,and he goes, &quot;It&#39;s something to do with the sewage system.&quot;I was, O.K.; that&#39;s fine.I finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing,and two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal,and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?You&#39;d think maybe cement, possibly, or something.But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD,and I&#39;ve also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape,and it&#39;s ready.

en:I did some work for Microsoft a few years back.It was a worldwide branding campaign.And it was interesting to me —my background is in sociology; I had no design training,and sometimes people say, well, that explains it —but it was a very interesting experimentbecause there&#39;s no product that I had to sell;it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.They thought some people didn&#39;t like them.(Laughter)I found out that&#39;s very true,working on this campaign worldwide.

en:This I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.I&#39;m not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea,because, like, if you don&#39;t spend quite enough time in front of your computer,you can now get a plate in the keyboard,so there&#39;s no more faking it —that you don&#39;t really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.Now there&#39;s a plate, and it would be really, really convenientto get a piece of pizza, then type a little bit, then ...I&#39;m just not sure this is improvement.

zh-cn:如果你怀疑平面设计的力量这个普通的告示只写着：“投希特勒一票。” 其他什么也没说这对我来说是个极端案例关于情感的的力量，平面设计的力量尽管在当时这是个普普通通的海报
en:If you ever doubt the power of graphic design,this is a very generic sign that literally says, &quot;Vote for Hitler.&quot; It says nothing else.And this to me is an extreme caseof the power of emotion, of graphic design,even though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.

zh-cn:接下来呢？接下来要说的是人们当我们越来越被科技驱使人的重要性越发明显你得在你的个性上做文章没有别人能这么做：没人能用上你的人生背景你的父母、成长过程、人生阅历如果你这样做，这真的是创造出独特作品的唯一办法你也会喜欢你的工作多得多
en:What&#39;s next? What&#39;s next is going to be people.As we get more technically driven,the importance of people becomes more than it&#39;s ever been before.You have to utilize who you are in your work.Nobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background,from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.If you allow that to happen, it&#39;s really the only way you can do some unique work,and you&#39;re going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.

zh-cn:这个－－我喜欢“拿来艺术”；而且手写体又要大行其道了这件作品两者兼有一位女士贴广告找她的比特犬它很友善的－－她给“友善”加了下划线－－可能正因如此她叫它“海格力斯”或者“海格儿”。她拼错了（笑）更重要地是，她愿意出20美元找这只比特犬所以我想，是的，好我要为了20美元搜寻比特犬了我想象人们走街串巷喊着海格力斯一个狗形物体向你扑过来，你赶紧说噢，求求你一定要是海格力斯；一定要是那个友善的（笑）我确定她一直没有找到爱犬，因为我把告示揭了（笑）
en:This is — I like found art; hand lettering&#39;s coming back in a big way,and I thought this was a great example of both.This lady&#39;s advertising for her lost pit bull.It&#39;s friendly — she&#39;s underlined friendly —that&#39;s probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can&#39;t spell.(Laughter)But more importantly,she&#39;s willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.And I&#39;m thinking, yeah, right,I&#39;ll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles,and you get charged by this thing and you go,oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.(Laughter)I&#39;m sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.(Laughter)

zh-cn:几年前我被邀请在萨克拉门托的一次会议上发言主题是勇气，那些人叫我谈做一个平面设计师要何等的勇气我回忆起看到我父亲的一张照片我爸是个测试飞行员，他曾经告诉我当你报名成为一个测试飞行员那些人告诉你有百分之四十到五十的几率你会光荣殉职这个比率对大多数职业来说是挺高的（笑）但是，你知道，政府造了一架飞机；他们说，去看看它能飞吗，愿意吗？有人去做了；有人就没有
en:But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talkabout how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father,who was a test pilot, and he told me thatwhen you signed up to become a test pilot,they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chanceof death on the job.That&#39;s pretty high for most occupations.(Laughter)But, you know, the government would make a plane;they&#39;d say, go see if that one flies, would you?Some of them did; some of them didn&#39;t.

zh-cn:我就开始思考我必须得做的一些抉择比如给字体加衬线呢还是不加衬线（笑）大多时候，这些都不会危及生命所以干嘛不去实验呢？干嘛不找点乐子？为什么不把你的个性放进作品里？从前当我教课时，我总是问学生一个好工作的定义是什么？作为老师，你听到了答案之后，你要给出正确答案我听到过最好的－－我相信你们有些人已经听说过了－－好工作的定义是：如果你负担得起－－如果钱不是问题你还会干同样的活吗？如果你会，你的工作很棒如果你不会，你在瞎捣鼓什么呢？离你死还早着呢谢谢大家！
en:And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to makebetween, like, serif versus san-serif.(Laughter)And for the most part, they&#39;re not real life-threatening.Why not experiment? Why not have some fun?Why not put some of yourself into the work?And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students,What&#39;s the definition of a good job?And as teachers, after you get all the answers,you like to give them the correct answer.And the best one I&#39;ve heard — I&#39;m sure some of you have heard this —the definition of a good job is:If you could afford to — if money wasn&#39;t an issue —would you be doing that same work?And if you would, you&#39;ve got a great job.And if you wouldn&#39;t, what the heck are you doing?You&#39;re going to be dead a really long time.Thank you very much.
