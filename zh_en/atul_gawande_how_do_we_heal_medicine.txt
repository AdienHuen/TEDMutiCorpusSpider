zh-cn:我的职业生涯从写作、研究开始当时还是个外科实习医生像很多人一样，需要经历漫漫长路才能成为某个领域的专家因而，在当时那个阶段你自然要问我该如何做好自己所尝试做的这一领域？这个问题会演变成我们怎样才能做好我们正在努力做的这件事？
en:I got my startin writing and researchas a surgical trainee,as someone who was a long ways awayfrom becoming any kind of an expert at anything.So the natural question you ask then at that pointis, how do I get good at what I&#39;m trying to do?And it became a question of,how do we all get goodat what we&#39;re trying to do?

zh-cn:要掌握技术着实不易需要对所学内容都吸收消化无论做什么就拿我来说，我必须学会如何缝合、如何开刀还得知道如何选择对的人进入手术室在以上思考过程中还隐藏这一个问题那就是：究竟什么才是造福于人？
en:It&#39;s hard enough to learn to get the skills,try to learn all the material you have to absorbat any task you&#39;re taking on.I had to think about how I sew and how I cut,but then also how I pick the right personto come to an operating room.And then in the midst of all thiscame this new contextfor thinking about what it meant to be good.

zh-cn:在过去几年中我们意识到自己深陷医学危机原因在于有些事情作为医生很难考虑到关于如何造福于人例如，医疗卫生的成本问题世界上没有一个国家不在问自己是否能支付医疗行为的代价这也引发了政治上的争论争论焦点围绕着究竟是政府还是保险公司才是罪魁祸首答案既“是”，也“否”还有更深层次的回答
en:In the last few yearswe realized we were in the deepest crisisof medicine&#39;s existencedue to something you don&#39;t normally think aboutwhen you&#39;re a doctorconcerned with how you do good for people,which is the costof health care.There&#39;s not a country in the worldthat now is not askingwhether we can afford what doctors do.The political fight that we&#39;ve developedhas become one aroundwhether it&#39;s the government that&#39;s the problemor is it insurance companies that are the problem.And the answer is yes and no;it&#39;s deeper than all of that.

zh-cn:造成麻烦的根源其实是科学带来的复杂性为了让大家更好地理解这个观点让我带大家回顾几代人之前的情况我想带大家回到刘易斯-托马斯写下《最年轻的科学》的那个时代刘易斯-托马斯是一位医生兼作家也是我最喜爱的作家之一他在书中描述了作一名实习医生的生活在当时的波士顿市立医院在盘尼西林尚未发现的年代那是1937年当时药物很便宜但疗效也不好他写道：如果你去看病医院对你的唯一帮助就是提供了给你提供了温暖、食物、住所，或许还有来自护士的关怀医生和药物的作用无关紧要即使这样当时的医生们还是忙得不可开交对此，他解释道
en:The cause of our troublesis actually the complexity that science has given us.And in order to understand this,I&#39;m going to take you back a couple of generations.I want to take you backto a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book, &quot;The Youngest Science.&quot;Lewis Thomas was a physician-writer,one of my favorite writers.And he wrote this book to explain, among other things,what it was like to be a medical internat the Boston City Hospitalin the pre-penicillin yearof 1937.It was a time when medicine was cheapand very ineffective.If you were in a hospital, he said,it was going to do you goodonly because it offered yousome warmth, some food, shelter,and maybe the caring attentionof a nurse.Doctors and medicinemade no difference at all.That didn&#39;t seem to prevent the doctorsfrom being frantically busy in their days,as he explained.

zh-cn:他们努力想做的就是弄清楚患者是否适用于某种诊断是他们可以治疗的这样的病症不多比如说，你患有大叶性肺炎医生可以对你进行抗血清治疗为你注射狂犬病抗体以此对抗链球菌前提是实习医生分类正确如果你不幸突发急性充血性心脏衰竭医生可以给你放一品脱的血从割开的手臂静脉里他们会为你准备一剂粗糙的洋地黄叶制剂然后让你在氧幕里吸氧如果你出现瘫痪的前期症状如果你很善于问个人问题你或许会发现这个病人的瘫痪很有可能是梅毒引发的因此你可以开出汞和砷的混合药剂只要不过量使用，不会置他们于死地除此之外医师能做的事并不多
en:What they were trying to dowas figure out whether you might have one of the diagnosesfor which they could do something.And there were a few.You might have a lobar pneumonia, for example,and they could give you an antiserum,an injection of rabid antibodiesto the bacterium streptococcus,if the intern sub-typed it correctly.If you had an acute congestive heart failure,they could bleed a pint of blood from youby opening up an arm vein,giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalisand then giving you oxygen by tent.If you had early signs of paralysisand you were really good at asking personal questions,you might figure outthat this paralysis someone has is from syphilis,in which case you could give this nice concoctionof mercury and arsenic —as long as you didn&#39;t overdose them and kill them.Beyond these sorts of things,a medical doctor didn&#39;t have a lot that they could do.
时间： 4:04
zh-cn:也就在那个时代，医疗的核心形成了那就是如何做好我们所做的事以及如何建立医疗体系当时医生能知道当时所有的医疗技术一个人就可以记住所有的医疗知识，也能实施所有的医疗行为如果你有处方权如果你有一名护士如果你有一所医院或许可以给你一个栖身之所，得到一些基本的工具你凭一己之力可以完成所有的事你可以处理骨折，可以抽血可以验血可以用显微镜观察你可以组织切片，可以注射抗血清这是工匠一般的生活
en:This was when the core structure of medicinewas created —what it meant to be good at what we didand how we wanted to build medicine to be.It was at a timewhen what was known you could know,you could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.If you had a prescription pad,if you had a nurse,if you had a hospitalthat would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools,you really could do it all.You set the fracture, you drew the blood,you spun the blood,looked at it under the microscope,you plated the culture, you injected the antiserum.This was a life as a craftsman.
时间： 4:46
zh-cn:最终，我们成功建立起了医疗文化和价值体系医生最应擅长的事就是行事大胆充满勇气并且要独立工作，自给自足自主是至高无上的价值观往后推几代人来看今天世界好像完全变了个样我们现在的治疗手段几乎能处理上万种人类可能患上的疑难杂症尽管不能治愈所有疾病我们不能保证每个人都长命百岁、无病无患但是我们可以让多数人过上健康长寿的生活
en:As a result, we built it arounda culture and set of valuesthat said what you were good atwas being daring,at being courageous,at being independent and self-sufficient.Autonomy was our highest value.Go a couple generations forwardto where we are, though,and it looks like a completely different world.We have now found treatmentsfor nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditionsthat a human being can have.We can&#39;t cure it all.We can&#39;t guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.But we can make it possiblefor most.

zh-cn:但是，实现这一结果的代价是什么呢？如今我们已经发现了4000种药物介入和外科手术我们研制了6000种药物这还仅仅是我现在处方权允许的范围我们正在尝试把这些治疗手段和药物，推广到更多地方挨家挨户地深入大众覆盖我们国家的每一寸土地乃至全球各个角落我们已经到了这样的地步作为医生我们认识到自己不能知晓一切也不能一一做到仅凭一己之力是不行的
en:But what does it take?Well, we&#39;ve now discovered4,000 medical and surgical procedures.We&#39;ve discovered 6,000 drugsthat I&#39;m now licensed to prescribe.And we&#39;re trying to deploy this capability,town by town,to every person alive —in our own country,let alone around the world.And we&#39;ve reached the point where we&#39;ve realized,as doctors,we can&#39;t know it all.We can&#39;t do it allby ourselves.

zh-cn:曾经有一项研究调查了不同时代下，照顾一名患者在医院里需要多少医务人员在1970年一般需要两名全职临床医务人员也就是说基本上是护士照料时间加上医生的一点点时间医生的时间只用来做查房一般一天一次到了20世纪末年这一数字上升到15名临床医务人员照顾同样一名典型的住院患者包括专科医生、普科医生以及护士
en:There was a study where they lookedat how many clinicians it took to take care of youif you came into a hospital,as it changed over time.And in the year 1970,it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians.That is to say,it took basically the nursing timeand then just a little bit of time for a doctorwho more or less checked in on youonce a day.By the end of the 20th century,it had become more than 15 cliniciansfor the same typical hospital patient —specialists, physical therapists,the nurses.
时间： 6:50
zh-cn:如今我们都是专科医生即便是基本卫生医疗单位的医生每个人也只提供自己专业范围内的一点点关怀但是为了坚持我们建立的医疗价值体系针对“勇敢”、“独立”“自给自足”对所有这些人而言就会变成一场灾难我们培训、雇佣、奖励医生把他们变成牛仔那样但是我们真正需要的是赛车维修队针对病人的维修队
en:We&#39;re all specialists now,even the primary care physicians.Everyone just hasa piece of the care.But holding onto that structure we builtaround the daring, independence,self-sufficiencyof each of those peoplehas become a disaster.We have trained, hired and rewarded peopleto be cowboys.But it&#39;s pit crews that we need,pit crews for patients.
时间： 7:22
zh-cn:我们身边就有这样的实例证明我们社区中40%的冠状动脉患者接受的治疗是不全面或不妥当的60%哮喘、中风病人接受的治疗是不全面或不妥当的200万人在医院的时候受到感染这些感染是他们原本所没有的因为有人忽略了最基本的卫生问题我们的经验表明当人们生病时需要得到别人的帮助应该是医生们的帮助可以让我们找到那些令人放心的医生勤奋努力、受过良好培训、并且聪明过人还可以得益于尖端技术这些都会给我们莫大的希望但极少能见到所有这些持续地共同作用于你贯穿整个医疗过程并且确保成功
en:There&#39;s evidence all around us:40 percent of our coronary artery disease patientsin our communitiesreceive incomplete or inappropriate care.60 percentof our asthma, stroke patientsreceive incomplete or inappropriate care.Two million people come into hospitalsand pick up an infectionthey didn&#39;t havebecause someone failed to followthe basic practices of hygiene.Our experienceas people who get sick,need help from other people,is that we have amazing cliniciansthat we can turn to —hardworking, incredibly well-trained and very smart —that we have access to incredible technologiesthat give us great hope,but little sensethat it consistently all comes together for youfrom start to finishin a successful way.
时间： 8:26
zh-cn:另外一个征兆我们需要维修队的原因是现有医疗体系高昂到无法控制的成本问题我想，在我们的医疗行业百思不得其解的就是这个成本问题我们想说：“这就是现实……这就是医药行业必需的“当你从用阿司匹林治疗关节炎的地方那往往是没有效果的到现在，对于严重病患我们可以做手术更换人工髋关节或膝盖那将帮助病人恢复原本可能丧失的功能安好地度过几十年这是一个多戏剧化的改变啊因此，如果说花4万美元进行个髋关节移植手术而不是花10美分买阿司匹林来缓解哪个更昂贵呢？这就是现实
en:There&#39;s another signthat we need pit crews,and that&#39;s the unmanageable costof our care.Now we in medicine, I think,are baffled by this question of cost.We want to say, &quot;This is just the way it is.This is just what medicine requires.&quot;When you go from a worldwhere you treated arthritis with aspirin,that mostly didn&#39;t do the job,to one where, if it gets bad enough,we can do a hip replacement, a knee replacementthat gives you years, maybe decades,without disability,a dramatic change,well is it any surprisethat that $40,000 hip replacementreplacing the 10-cent aspirinis more expensive?It&#39;s just the way it is.
时间： 9:17
zh-cn:但我认为，我们忽略了一些事实这些事实告诉我们，我们能做的其实有很多我们看到一些数据关于医疗行为的结果尽管环境日益复杂我们发现最昂贵的医疗不见得是最好的反之亦然最好的医疗通常花不了几个钱而且更简单人们在那种情况下效率更高这一发现的含义在于我们还有希望因为，假如我们想要获得最好的结果要用到最贵的医疗在一国范围内、或者在世界范围内最贵那么我们真的要去讨论的就是配额制度决定哪些人不能享受医疗保险那将会成为唯一的选择
en:But I think we&#39;re ignoring certain factsthat tell us something about what we can do.As we&#39;ve looked at the dataabout the results that have comeas the complexity has increased,we foundthat the most expensive careis not necessarily the best care.And vice versa,the best careoften turns out to be the least expensive —has fewer complications,the people get more efficient at what they do.And what that meansis there&#39;s hope.Because [if] to have the best results,you really needed the most expensive carein the country, or in the world,well then we really would be talking about rationingwho we&#39;re going to cut off from Medicare.That would be really our only choice.
时间：10:15
zh-cn:但如果我们看看积极的反面事例确实存在以最低的成本获得最佳效果的例子我们发现最像“系统”的是最成功的也就是说，我们发现了平衡所有不同部分不同因素的方法让各个部分变成一个整体仅有好的组成部分是远远不够的然而我们正是对医药的组成部分太过痴迷了我们想要最好的药物、最好的技术最好的专科医生但我们却不曾想过这些如何组合在一起这其实是个很糟糕的战略设计
en:But when we look at the positive deviants —the ones who are getting the best resultsat the lowest costs —we find the ones that look the most like systemsare the most successful.That is to say, they found waysto get all of the different pieces,all of the different components,to come together into a whole.Having great components is not enough,and yet we&#39;ve been obsessed in medicine with components.We want the best drugs, the best technologies,the best specialists,but we don&#39;t think too muchabout how it all comes together.It&#39;s a terrible design strategy actually.
时间：10:59
zh-cn:有一个很著名的思考实验验证了这个想法实验是这样的，假如你用最好的汽车零件能造出怎样一辆车？你可以用保时捷的刹车法拉利的引擎沃尔沃的车身，宝马的底盘你把这些都组装在一起会得到一辆怎样的车呢？答案是：一堆很贵的垃圾，一辆完全不能开的车有时候医药行业也是这样它并非一个系统
en:There&#39;s a famous thought experimentthat touches exactly on thisthat said, what if you built a carfrom the very best car parts?Well it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes,a Ferrari engine,a Volvo body, a BMW chassis.And you put it all together and what do you get?A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere.And that is what medicine can feel like sometimes.It&#39;s not a system.
时间：11:32
zh-cn:然而，为了组建一个体系当所有部分都组合到一起你需要有特定的技巧来让它运作起来，让它看起来像回事儿首当其冲的是辨识成功的能力以及辨识失败的能力假如你是一名专科医生如果你无法很好地设想最终结果你必须认真分析数据这听上去非常无趣
en:Now a system, however,when things start to come together,you realize it has certain skillsfor acting and looking that way.Skill number oneis the ability to recognize successand the ability to recognize failure.When you are a specialist,you can&#39;t see the end result very well.You have to become really interested in data,unsexy as that sounds.
时间：12:00
zh-cn:我的一个外科医生同事，在爱荷华州锡达拉皮兹工作他对一个问题产生了兴趣那就是：他们在锡达拉皮兹做了多少个CT扫描？他对此很感兴趣因为政府报告新闻报道、期刊论文都在说现在做的CT扫描过量了但他没在自己的病人中看到这个问题因此他提出这一疑问：”我们究竟做了多少CT扫描呢？“他想得到这一数据于是他花了3个月时间此前，在他的社区，没人有过这个疑问后来，他发现在社区的300,000人中过去一年间他们曾做了52,000次CT扫描于是他们发现了一个问题
en:One of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,and he got interested in the question of,well how many CT scans did they dofor their community in Cedar Rapids?He got interested in thisbecause there had been government reports,newspaper reports, journal articlessaying that there had been too many CT scans done.He didn&#39;t see it in his own patients.And so he asked the question, &quot;How many did we do?&quot;and he wanted to get the data.It took him three months.No one had asked this question in his community before.And what he found was that,for the 300,000 people in their community,in the previous yearthey had done 52,000 CT scans.They had found a problem.
时间：12:47
zh-cn:也就引出了我要说的运作系统的第二项技巧技巧1是：发现我们错在哪里技巧2是：设计解决方案我对此也颇感兴趣世界卫生组织曾来找我的团队问我们是否能帮他们做一个项目来降低外科手术的死亡率如今外科手术在世界范围内数量日益增长但是手术的安全性却令人担忧现在我们普遍的做法是开展更多培训让医生更加专业或者提高技术
en:Which brings us to skill number two a system has.Skill one, find where your failures are.Skill two is devise solutions.I got interested in thiswhen the World Health Organization came to my teamasking if we could help with a projectto reduce deaths in surgery.The volume of surgery had spreadaround the world,but the safety of surgeryhad not.Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like theseare to do more training,give people more specializationor bring in more technology.
时间：13:26
zh-cn:所以，在手术中，我们的医生都是非常专业的受过非常好的教育和培训然而我们还是看到高得不正常的死亡率和致残率这些原本都是可以避免的因此我们参考了其他高风险行业的做法我们观察了摩天大楼的建设我们研究了飞机制造业然后发现他们有技术、他们有培训而且他们还有一样东西那就是检查表我没有想到自己作为一名哈佛外科医生会把大部分时间用来烦恼检查表这个东西然而，我们发现正是这个工具帮助专家达到最佳效果我们得到了波音公司首席安全工程师的帮助
en:Well in surgery, you couldn&#39;t have people who are more specializedand you couldn&#39;t have people who are better trained.And yet we see unconscionable levelsof death, disabilitythat could be avoided.And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.We looked at skyscraper construction,we looked at the aviation world,and we foundthat they have technology, they have training,and then they have one other thing:They have checklists.I did not expectto be spending a significant partof my time as a Harvard surgeonworrying about checklists.And yet, what we foundwere that these were toolsto help make experts better.We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.
时间：14:19
zh-cn:我们请教他如何设计一张用于外科手术的清单？并非为了社会底层人士而是针对在这条产业链的每个环节上的人包括外科医生在内的整个团队他们教我们的是要设计好检查表来帮助人们处理复杂问题其实比想象的要难你必须考虑很多问题比如“暂停时点”你需要认识到整个流程中的一些时刻能够在危险来临前及时发现问题作出处理以免酿成大祸你必须把它当做是一张飞机起飞前的检查表你一定要关注一些至关重要的项目在一份飞机制造检查表上就像这张针对单引擎飞机的检查清单它可不是驾驶飞机的窍门而是对关键问题的提醒如果他们不去检查很可能会遗漏这些问题
en:Could we design a checklist for surgery?Not for the lowest people on the totem pole,but for the folkswho were all the way around the chain,the entire team including the surgeons.And what they taught uswas that designing a checklistto help people handle complexityactually involves more difficulty than I had understood.You have to think about thingslike pause points.You need to identify the moments in a processwhen you can actually catch a problem before it&#39;s a dangerand do something about it.You have to identifythat this is a before-takeoff checklist.And then you need to focus on the killer items.An aviation checklist,like this one for a single-engine plane,isn&#39;t a recipe for how to fly a plane,it&#39;s a reminder of the key thingsthat get forgotten or missedif they&#39;re not checked.
时间：15:11
zh-cn:因此我们也效仿了他们的做法我们设计了一张检查表，19个项目，用时2分钟针对手术团队其中包含“暂停时点”例如，实施麻醉前手术刀接触病人皮肤之前病人离开手术室之前检查表上不乏很多看上去很简单的事情例如，确保在正确的时间使用抗生素光这一点就让感染率下降了一半还有些有意思的事你无法为手术这样复杂的事情事先开出处方然而，你却可以开处方给这个团队，使他们能更好地去面对突发状况我们列出的项目中就包括：确保每个在房间的人都在手术开始前互相做了自我介绍因为很多时候，起码有六个人在这个新组建的团队中都是初次见面
en:So we did this.We created a 19-item two-minute checklistfor surgical teams.We had the pause pointsimmediately before anesthesia is given,immediately before the knife hits the skin,immediately before the patient leaves the room.And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there —making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time framebecause that cuts the infection rate by half —and then interesting stuff,because you can&#39;t make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.Instead, you can make a recipefor how to have a team that&#39;s prepared for the unexpected.And we had items like making sure everyone in the roomhad introduced themselves by name at the start of the day,because you get half a dozen people or morewho are sometimes coming together as a teamfor the very first time that day that you&#39;re coming in.
时间：16:01
zh-cn:后来，我们在世界上8所医院执行、推广了这份检查表其中包括坦桑尼亚的乡村也包括在西雅图的华盛顿大学我们发现，当他们使用了这份检查表之后复杂程度大大降低降低了35%每所医院都是如此死亡率也降低了降低了47%这比任何一种药物都管用
en:We implemented this checklistin eight hospitals around the world,deliberately in places from rural Tanzaniato the University of Washington in Seattle.We found that after they adopted itthe complication rates fell35 percent.It fell in every hospital it went into.The death rates fell47 percent.This was bigger than a drug.

时间：16:34
zh-cn:这将引出第三项技巧执行能力让所有产业链上的同事都能切实地这样做事推广这些很花时间这还不是我们做手术的规范更别说应用于例如分娩等其他紧迫的领域在执行中往往会遇到强大的阻力因为使用这些工具会迫使我们去面对我们还未成为“系统”这一事实会迫使我们不得不用另一套价值观去操作使用一份检查表需要你用与以往不同的价值操守例如谦虚纪律团队合作这与我们所建立的价值观刚好背道而驰：独立、自给自足自治
en:And that brings usto skill number three,the ability to implement this,to get colleagues across the entire chainto actually do these things.And it&#39;s been slow to spread.This is not yet our norm in surgery —let alone making checkliststo go onto childbirth and other areas.There&#39;s a deep resistancebecause using these toolsforces us to confrontthat we&#39;re not a system,forces us to behave with a different set of values.Just using a checklistrequires you to embrace different values from the ones we&#39;ve had,like humility,discipline,teamwork.This is the opposite of what we were built on:independence, self-sufficiency,autonomy.
时间：17:31
zh-cn:说到这儿，我想起来曾经遇到过一个真正的牛仔我问他：牛仔到底是如何将上千头牛放牧几百英里你们是怎么做的？他回答说：“我们有牛仔驻扎在牧区的几个地点”他们通过电子设备不断交流他们有规章制度和各种检查表去处理发生的各种情况（笑声）比如，恶劣天气比如，突发事件，或者为牛群接种如今，就连牛仔们也组成了维修队似乎是时候我们也变成那样了
en:I met an actual cowboy, by the way.I asked him, what was it liketo actually herd a thousand cattleacross hundreds of miles?How did you do that?And he said, &quot;We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around.&quot;They communicate electronically constantly,and they have protocols and checklistsfor how they handle everything —(Laughter)— from bad weatherto emergencies or inoculations for the cattle.Even the cowboys are pit crews now.And it seemed like timethat we become that way ourselves.
时间：18:08
zh-cn:靠“系统”来工作这正是我们这代人作为医生和科学家的的首要任务进一步说要让“系统”运转起来无论是医疗、教育还是气候变化还是消除贫困都是我们这代人，作为一个整体需要完成的重要任务在各个领域都有知识爆炸情况更加复杂专业性更强我们别无选择只能去认识到尽管我们都崇尚个人主义但复杂性要求我们取得集体成功我们全都需要成为维修队
en:Making systems workis the great task of my generationof physicians and scientists.But I would go further and saythat making systems work,whether in health care, education,climate change,making a pathway out of poverty,is the great task of our generation as a whole.In every field, knowledge has exploded,but it has brought complexity,it has brought specialization.And we&#39;ve come to a place where we have no choicebut to recognize,as individualistic as we want to be,complexity requiresgroup success.We all need to be pit crews now.
