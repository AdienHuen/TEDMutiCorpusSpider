zh-cn:如何喂养一个城市？这是我们这个时代的一个重大问题之一。然而很少人会问这个问题。我们习以为常了， 我们走进商店的时候走进餐厅的时候，或是一个小时后我们进入这个剧院的门厅总会有食物等着我们它们很神奇地从某个地方冒出来
en:How do you feed a city?It&#39;s one of the great questions of our time.Yet it&#39;s one that&#39;s rarely asked.We take it for granted that if we go into a shopor restaurant, or indeed into this theater&#39;s foyer in about an hour&#39;s time,there is going to be food there waiting for us,having magically come from somewhere.

zh-cn:然而，当你想像每一天，在一个伦敦那么大的城市，要生产足够的食物运输、交易这些食物，烹饪，食用，最后扔弃它们而且类似的事情每天都发生着在地球上的每一个城市都如此每个城市都有食物供应，这件事很不可思议
en:But when you think that every day for a city the size of London,enough food has to be produced,transported, bought and sold,cooked, eaten, disposed of,and that something similar has to happen every dayfor every city on earth,it&#39;s remarkable that cities get fed at all.

zh-cn:我们住在每天有食物供应的城市，仿佛这是世界上最自然的事情，我们忘记了我们也是动物，所以我们需要进食，事实上我们要依赖自然界就如同我们的祖先要依赖自然界一样。随着我们越来越多人到城市生活，越来越多的自然界正在变成我身后的这些特别的景象这是巴西Mata Grosso的大豆田用来种食物养活我们这些特别的景象我们很少人亲眼目睹过
en:We live in places like this as ifthey&#39;re the most natural things in the world,forgetting that because we&#39;re animalsand that we need to eat,we&#39;re actually as dependent on the natural worldas our ancient ancestors were.And as more of us move into cities,more of that natural world is beingtransformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me —it&#39;s soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil —in order to feed us.These are extraordinary landscapes,but few of us ever get to see them.

zh-cn:越来越多的这些地貌不只是生产食物养活我们随着我们越来越多人移居城市越来越多人吃肉所以每年全球有三分之一的粮食现在是用来喂动物而不是喂养我们人类虽然说需要3倍的粮食事实上却是10倍的食物来喂养一个人，如果从喂养动物的粮食也计算在内这并不是一个很有效率的喂养方式
en:And increasingly these landscapesare not just feeding us either.As more of us move into cities,more of us are eating meat,so that a third of the annual grain crop globallynow gets fed to animalsrather than to us human animals.And given that it takes three times as much grain —actually ten times as much grain —to feed a human if it&#39;s passed through an animal first,that&#39;s not a very efficient way of feeding us.

zh-cn:这是一个越来越重要的问题到2050年,预测有两倍的人口将在城市居住预测到也将需要两倍的肉和奶类制品的消耗所以肉的消耗和城市化是共同发展的这就将引发一个很重大的问题要喂养60亿的饥饿人口在2050年这是个大问题.如果我们还像我们现在这么发展,我们很可能没法在2050年解决这个问题
en:And it&#39;s an escalating problem too.By 2050, it&#39;s estimated that twice the numberof us are going to be living in cities.And it&#39;s also estimated that there is going to be twice as muchmeat and dairy consumed.So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.And that&#39;s going to pose an enormous problem.Six billion hungry carnivores to feed,by 2050.That&#39;s a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are,it&#39;s a problem we&#39;re very unlikely to be able to solve.

zh-cn:每年有1900万公顷的雨林消失它们用作开垦新的耕地尽管与此同时我们也失去等量的现有耕地,因为盐碱化或水土流失我们也急需化石燃料在欧洲，我们需要10卡路里的能量来生产1卡路里为我们消耗的食物尽管这些食物我们都是花了很多功夫才生产出来事实上我们却不珍惜它们在美国有一半食物被扔弃最终,在这漫长过程的最后我们将没法养活我们这个地球我们中10亿人肥胖,还有多于10亿的人处于饥饿中这些都没有道理
en:Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every yearto create new arable land.Although at the same time we&#39;re losing an equivalent amountof existing arables to salinization and erosion.We&#39;re very hungry for fossil fuels too.It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorieof food that we consume in the West.And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,we don&#39;t actually value it.Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.And to end all of this, at the end of this long process,we&#39;re not even managing to feed the planet properly.A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.None of it makes very much sense.

zh-cn:当你发现现在80%的全球食物贸易仅由五家跨国公司控制,这是挺可怕的随着我们搬进城市,世界正在接受西方的饮食如果我们展望未来这不是个可持续的饮食方式
en:And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food nowis controlled by just five multinational corporations,it&#39;s a grim picture.As we&#39;re moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.And if we look to the future,it&#39;s an unsustainable diet.

zh-cn:我们怎么会走到这一步?更重要的是,我们应该怎么做?先回答那个较简单的问题,首先我想说,在大概1万年前是这个过程的开始在古代的中东地区也就是广大的新月状的地区因为你可以看到它是新月形的同时它也是广大的就在这里,大概1万年前2大伟大的发明农业和城市化在此发生几乎在同时,同一地点
en:So how did we get here?And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?Well, to answer the slightly easier question first,about 10,000 years ago, I would say,is the beginning of this processin the ancient Near East,known as the Fertile Crescent.Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.And it was also fertile.And it was here, about 10,000 years ago,that two extraordinary inventions,agriculture and urbanism, happenedroughly in the same place and at the same time.
时间： 4:01
zh-cn:这并不是偶然因为农业和城市是紧密联系的.它们需要彼此因为粮食的发现我们的远古祖先,第一次第一次生产出足够的粮食并且产量稳地，这帮助他们长期居住下来如果我们看一下当时那些居住地我们可以看到他们是紧密的他们被农田围绕并由一些大的庙宇统领着例如这一个在乌尔的神殿事实上,他们是很有效的精神统领,食物分发中心，两者结合
en:This is no accident,because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.Because it was discovery of grainby our ancient ancestors for the first timethat produced a food source that was large enoughand stable enough to support permanent settlements.And if we look at what those settlements were like,we see they were compact.They were surrounded by productive farm landand dominated by large temple complexeslike this one at Ur,that were, in fact, effectively,spiritualized, central food distribution centers.
时间： 4:35
zh-cn:因为这些神殿组织耕作收集这些粮食,供奉给诸神然后把诸神没吃的食物发还给人们所以这些城市的精神和物质生活都用粮食和收成掌控并维持城市的生活事实上，过去的每个城市都是如此当然，并不是每个都是那么小的城市比如很著名的罗马城有大约100万居民在公元一世纪的之前那么，这样的城市是如何维持供给的呢？在我眼里，我把答案称作“古老的城市之路”
en:Because it was the temples that organized the harvest,gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,and then offered the grain that the gods didn&#39;t eat back to the people.So, if you like,the whole spiritual and physical life of these citieswas dominated by the grain and the harvestthat sustained them.And in fact, that&#39;s true of every ancient city.But of course not all of them were that small.Famously, Rome had about a million citizensby the first century A.D.So how did a city like this feed itself?The answer is what I call &quot;ancient food miles.&quot;

zh-cn:基本上，罗马有通往海洋的道路这样使从很远的地方进口食物成为可能这样是在古代能实现的唯一的方法因为陆上运输相当困难鉴于路况不好而且食物的消耗是很快的所以罗马常常发动战争攻打像迦太基和埃及那样的国家仅仅是为了得到他们的粮食储备其实，事实上，你可以把帝国的扩张理解为一种长期的军事化的购物狂欢（笑）事实上，我喜欢这个事实。我不得不指出的是罗马（从英国进口牡蛎）在一个时期。我认为这非常特别
en:Basically, Rome had access to the sea,which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,because it was very difficult to transport food over roads,which were rough.And the food obviously went off very quickly.So Rome effectively waged waron places like Carthage and Egyptjust to get its paws on their grain reserves.And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empirewas really sort of one long, drawn outmilitarized shopping spree, really.(Laughter)In fact — I love the fact, I just have to mention this:Rome in fact used to import oysters from London,at one stage. I think that&#39;s extraordinary.
时间： 5:51
zh-cn:所以罗马形成自己的海岸线根据他的口味但是还有一件有趣的事情发生在前工业化的世界如果我们看看十七世纪伦敦的地图我们可以看见作物从泰晤士河畔出产的位于地图的底部因为市场在城市的南部道路从那里通向主要消费市场戚普塞街(位于伦敦)这里也是粮食的主要消费市场
en:So Rome shaped its hinterlandthrough its appetite.But the interesting thing is that the other thing alsohappened in the pre-industrial world.If we look at a map of London in the 17th century,we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,along the bottom of this map.So the grain markets were to the south of the city.And the roads leading up from themto Cheapside, which was the main market,were also grain markets.

zh-cn:如果我们随便看看这里的一条街道的名字BREAD（面包）街，你可以明白三百年前这里都发生了什么这个道理同样使用于鱼类鱼当然是从河里面打捞出来的Billlingsgate是伦敦有名的卖鱼市场在1980年之前这是很特别的，真的，当你仔细想想每个人都在这里游荡拿着像转头一样的大哥大还有，在港口还有发臭的鱼
en:And if you look at the name of one of those streets,Bread Street, you can tellwhat was going on there 300 years ago.And the same of course was true for fish.Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London&#39;s fish market,operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.Everybody else was wandering aroundwith mobile phones that looked like bricksand sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.

zh-cn:这是在城市中关于食物的另一件事情一旦一种食物在某个城市站稳脚跟它的地位很难被动摇肉是一个非常不同的故事了因为，动物自己走向城市因此，伦敦消费的大量肉类是从西北方过来的从苏格兰和威尔士当他们过来，抵达城市的西北方这就说明了为什么 Smithfield伦敦一个非常有名的肉类市场，在这里产生家禽从Anglia的东部来，去往东北部我感觉这有点像一个天气播报员然后鸟儿都飞过来了它们的脚被小帆布鞋包裹着然后当它们在东部降落的时候具体说来是在戚普塞街，也就是它们被卖掉的地方这也就是戚普塞街被称为“家禽”街的原因
en:This is another thing about food in cities:Once its roots into the city are established,they very rarely move.Meat is a very different storybecause, of course, animals could walk into the city.So much of London&#39;s meatwas coming from the northwest,from Scotland and Wales.So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,which is why Smithfield,London&#39;s very famous meat market, was located up there.Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,and so the birds were coming inwith their feet protected with little canvas shoes.And then when they hit the eastern endof Cheapside, that&#39;s where they were sold,which is why it&#39;s called Poultry.

zh-cn:事实上，如果你看看任何一个城市的地图在工业化时代之前你能够发现食物是如何进入城市的事实上，你可以看出食物是如何塑造一个城市的通过阅读街道的名称，你就会发现很多线索星期五街，在过去的日子中是一个在星期五买鱼的地方但是，你同时也必须想象那里到处都是食物因为街道和公共区域是食物买卖的唯一地点
en:And, in fact, if you look at the map of any citybuilt before the industrial age,you can trace food coming in to it.You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.Friday Street, in a previous life,is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.But also you have to imagine it full of food.Because the streets and the public spaceswere the only places where food was bought and sold.
时间： 7:57
zh-cn:如果你想象一下1830年的Smithfield你会发现很难在这样一个城市里面生活下去并且不留意食物的来源事实上，当你在星期日吃午饭的时候你将很有可能听到窗外的牛羊的叫声在三年以前因此，显然他是一个有机城市属于有机循环中的一个部分但是，10年后，一切都改变了
en:And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like thisand be unaware of where your food came from.In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your windowabout three days earlier.So this was obviously an organic city,part of an organic cycle.And then 10 years later everything changed.

zh-cn:这是大西铁路在1840的照片你可以看见，一些早期的铁路乘客们是猪和羊群一夕之间，这些动物不再走进市场他们被屠宰了在乡村的某个地方然后他们通过铁路来到了城市这些改变了一切首先，他第一次使城市成长变成了可能不论地点、成为什么规模和形状的城市城市发展过去受到地理的限制城市需要通过很艰难的方式获得食物突然，他们从地理限制中解放了出来
en:This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengerswere pigs and sheep.So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.They&#39;re being slaughtered out of sight and mind,somewhere in the countryside.And they&#39;re coming into the city by rail.And this changes everything.To start off with, it makes it possiblefor the first time to grow cities,really any size and shape, in any place.Cities used to be constrained by geography;they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
时间： 8:56
zh-cn:你可以看看伦敦的地图在铁路建成后的90年它从容易喂饱的一小点通过动物步行到市场等方式成长成为大型的奢侈的大都市步行运输再也不能喂饱每个人不论是对人还是对动物当然，这仅仅是开始。当汽车代替了火车这真正标志这个过程的结束这是城市的最终解放从自然的束缚中完全的解放了
en:And as you can see from these maps of London,in the 90 years after the trains came,it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feedby animals coming in on foot, and so on,to a large splurge,that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,either animals or people.And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,and really this marks the end of this process.It&#39;s the final emancipation of the cityfrom any apparent relationship with nature at all.
时间： 9:27
zh-cn:这样类型的城市没有了原来城市的味道乱糟糟的市容，当然也缺少了人因为没有人想要在这么大的一块地方步行事实上，他们都开小汽车去购买食物了开车去郊外的超级市场买回来一周需要的食物然后考虑到底如何规划这些食品这时刻，食物和城市的关系，完全的改变了
en:And this is the kind of city that&#39;s devoid of smell,devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,came back with a week&#39;s worth of shopping,and wondered what on earth to do with it.And this really is the moment when our relationship,both with food and cities, changes completely.
时间： 9:51
zh-cn:过去买食物是在市中心在城市的最核心地带买卖食物曾经是一种社会性的活动，现在都是匿名了的我们原来还需要烹饪，现在我们只需要加水或者是一些鸡蛋，当我们在做蛋糕或者其他东西的时候我们不会在去闻闻食物来确认它是否可以吃了我们只是阅读包装袋上的使用说明就好我们没有发现食物的价值，我们也不信赖它我们甚至担心它从体会它的价值变成浪费
en:Here we have food — that used to be the center,the social core of the city — at the periphery.It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.Now it&#39;s anonymous.We used to cook; now we just add water,or a little bit of an egg if you&#39;re making a cake or something.We don&#39;t smell food to see if it&#39;s okay to eat.We just read the back of a label on a packet.And we don&#39;t value food. We don&#39;t trust it.So instead of trusting it, we fear it.And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
时间：10:24
zh-cn:当今食品工业最最讽刺的是他们让生活极致地便利却也使得一切更为复杂因为可以自由的建立新城市但是他们却疏远了人可贵的联系也就是人与自然的联系同时，他们也让我们依赖这个系统这个系统，在我们看来，是不可持续的
en:One of the great ironies of modern food systemsis that they&#39;ve made the very thing they promisedto make easier much harder.By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,they&#39;ve actually distanced us from our most important relationship,which is that of us and nature.And also they&#39;ve made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,that, as we&#39;ve seen, are unsustainable.

zh-cn:所以，我们应该做点什么呢？这不是一个新的问题500年前，汤马斯摩尔曾经问过自己这是他的书《乌托邦》的主旨它是一个半独立的城邦如果这么说听上去还比较熟悉的话一天的行走你会看见所有人农场都在疯狂的种植或者在自己的后院种植蔬菜然后一起享用乡镇的共有食物，等等我认为你可能想要说食物是乌托邦维持秩序的基础尽管摩尔从来没有这么构想
en:So what are we going to do about that?It&#39;s not a new question.500 years ago it&#39;s what Thomas More was asking himself.This is the frontispiece of his book &quot;Utopia.&quot;And it was a series of semi-independent city-states,if that sounds remotely familiar,a day&#39;s walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,and grew vegetables in their back gardens,and ate communal meals together, and so on.And I think you could argue thatfood is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,even though More never framed it that way.
时间：11:19
zh-cn:这里有一个很著名的乌托邦蓝图来自埃比尼泽·霍华德的“花园城市”同样的想法。一系列半独立的城邦小型都市被可耕地包围相互之间通过铁路连接当然，食物在一次被称作维持秩序的物体，在他的版本中这些田园都市是有的，但与当初霍华的愿景没有关系这也与乌托邦的构想产生了冲突因为他们是乌托邦（不存在的）
en:And here is another very famous &quot;Utopian&quot; vision,that of Ebenezer Howard, &quot;The Garden City.&quot;Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states,little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,joined to one another by railway.And again, food could be said to bethe ordering principle of his vision.It even got built, but nothing to do withthis vision that Howard had.And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,that they are Utopian.
时间：11:47
zh-cn:乌托邦实际是上一个托马斯摩尔故意使用的一个词这似乎是一个笑话。因为它在希腊中有两个来历他既可以表示一个好的地方，也可以表示一个不存在的地方因为他是一种理想。一个想象中的事物。我们不能拥有它我认为，这是一个观念用来深层次的思考人类居住的问题它不是很有用所以我提出另一个概念“希托邦”，在古希腊文中“希托”代表食物，“邦”是地方
en:Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.It was a kind of joke, because it&#39;s got a double derivation from the Greek.It can either mean a good place, or no place.Because it&#39;s an ideal. It&#39;s an imaginary thing. We can&#39;t have it.And I think, as a conceptual toolfor thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,that makes it not much use.So I&#39;ve come up with an alternative,which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,&quot;sitos&quot; for food, and &quot;topos&quot; for place.
时间：12:15
zh-cn:我相信我们已经住在“希托邦”里面这个世界是受食物影响的只要认清楚这个事实，食物便能成为有力的工具一个概念性的工具，设计工具，用来改变这个世界如果这样做，希托邦会成什么样我是这样想的我用投影这张照片，是因为这狗长相可爱无论如何，在这里（笑）食物是生活的重心是家庭生活的重心，被赞颂被享用，你们花时间在这上面这是食物在我们社会里应有的地位
en:I believe we already live in Sitopia.We live in a world shaped by food,and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool —a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?Well I think it looks a bit like this.I have to use this slide. It&#39;s just the look on the face of the dog.But anyway, this is — (Laughter)it&#39;s food at the center of life,at the center of family life, being celebrated,being enjoyed, people taking time for it.This is where food should be in our society.
时间：12:48
zh-cn:但想做到这样，得先有这些人他也可以是男的这些人是会想到食物的他们会预先思考，做计划看到一堆生菜时知道那是什么我们需要这种人。我们都是整体的一部分因为如果没有这样的人，就不会有这样的地方我故意选了这个因为这张照片显示一个人在买蔬菜但是整体联络，食物是当地生产的他是大面积的，也是新鲜的这是城市社会生活的一部分因为没有它，你就不会拥有这样的地方种植食物的地方也是风景的一部分他不仅仅是一个消费商品来自看不见的黑暗角落成片的牛群冒着水汽的肥沃土壤这才使一切变得完整
en:But you can&#39;t have scenes like this unless you have people like this.By the way, these can be men as well.It&#39;s people who think about food,who think ahead, who plan,who can stare at a pile of raw vegetablesand actually recognize them.We need these people. We&#39;re part of a network.Because without these kinds of people we can&#39;t have places like this.Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.It&#39;s common. It&#39;s fresh.It&#39;s part of the social life of the city.Because without that, you can&#39;t have this kind of place,food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,and is not just a zero-sum commodityoff in some unseen hell-hole.Cows with a view.Steaming piles of humus.This is basically bringing the whole thing together.

zh-cn:这是一个集体的计划我最近去了多伦多在这个温室里，孩子学习关于食物的知识，以及他们种植自己所需的食物这有一颗菜叫做凯文，他也许属于一个叫凯文的小孩子。我不太确定但是不管怎么说，这类计划是及其重要的，因为他们试图重新建立我们和自然的联系
en:And this is a community projectI visited recently in Toronto.It&#39;s a greenhouse, where kids get toldall about food and growing their own food.Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it&#39;s aplant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don&#39;t know.But anyway, these kinds of projectsthat are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.

zh-cn:因此，希托邦，是另一种观点基本上，我们认可在某些小地方希托邦已经存在了下一步就是将他们连接起来从食物的角度看如果我们这样做了，城市将不再是一个不从事生产的大都市，像现在一样我们将把城市作为一个有机生产的一部分在这种架构下，城乡之间以一种共生的方式连接但这也不是什么大理论因为我们不需要这样的食物产出方式了我们需要更多的思考关于社区生态农业所以这张图很合适来做一个结论我们需要重新思考食物如何塑造我们的生活
en:So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.It&#39;s basically recognizing that Sitopiaalready exists in little pockets everywhere.The trick is to join them up,to use food as a way of seeing.And if we do that, we&#39;re going to stop seeing citiesas big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.We&#39;re going to see them more like this,as part of the productive, organic frameworkof which they are inevitably a part,symbiotically connected.But of course, that&#39;s not a great image either,because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.We need to be thinking more about permaculture,which is why I think this image justsums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.It&#39;s a re-conceptualizationof the way food shapes our lives.

en:The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.It&#39;s Ambrogio Lorenzetti&#39;s &quot;Allegory of Good Government.&quot;It&#39;s about the relationship between the city and the countryside.And I think the message of this is very clear.If the city looks after the country,the country will look after the city.And I want us to ask now,what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paintif he painted this image today?What would an allegory of good government look like today?Because I think it&#39;s an urgent question.It&#39;s one we have to ask,and we have to start answering.We know we are what we eat.We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.But if we take that idea, we can use foodas a really powerful tool to shape the world better.Thank you very much.(Applause)
