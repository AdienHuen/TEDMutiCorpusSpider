zh-cn:当时是95年我在上大学我和一个朋友开车去玩从罗得岛的普罗旺斯区出发到奥勒冈州的波特兰市我们年轻，无业于是整个旅程都在乡间小道经过州立公园和国家保护森林我们尽可能绕着最长的路径在南达科塔州之中某处我转向我的朋友问她一个两千英里路途上一直烦恼我的问题&quot;路边那个一直出现的中文字到底是什么?&quot;我的朋友露出疑惑的神情正如现在坐在第一排的这三位男士所露出的神情一样（笑声）我说&quot;你知道的我们一直看到的那个路牌写着中文的那个啊&quot;她瞪着我的脸一阵子突然笑开了因为她总算知道我所指为何我说的是这个（笑声）没错，这就是代表野餐区的那个中文字
en:So it&#39;s 1995,I&#39;m in college,and a friend and I go on a road tripfrom Providence, Rhode Islandto Portland, Oregon.And you know, we&#39;re young and unemployed,so we do the whole thing on back roadsthrough state parksand national forests —basically the longest route we can possibly take.And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,I turn to my friendand I ask her a questionthat&#39;s been bothering mefor 2,000 miles.&quot;What&#39;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?&quot;My friend looks at me totally blankly.There&#39;s actually a gentleman in the front rowwho&#39;s doing a perfect imitation of her look.(Laughter)And I&#39;m like, &quot;You know,all the signs we keep seeingwith the Chinese character on them.&quot;She just stares at me for a few moments,and then she cracks up,because she figures out what I&#39;m talking about.And what I&#39;m talking about is this.(Laughter)Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.

zh-cn:过去的五年我一直在思考刚刚我所描述的状况为什么我们会对身边的征兆产生误解当误解发生时我们作何反应以及这一切所告诉我们的人性换句话说，就像 Chris 刚才说的过去五年的时间我都在思考错误的价值你可能觉得这是个奇异的专业但有一项好处是不容置疑的：没有竞争者。（笑声）事实上，我们大部分的人都尽力不思考错误的价值或至少避免想到我们有可能犯错。我们都知道这个模糊的概念。我们都知道这里的每个人都曾经犯错人类本来就会犯错 － 没问题
en:I&#39;ve spent the last five years of my lifethinking about situationsexactly like this —why we sometimes misunderstandthe signs around us,and how we behave when that happens,and what all of this can tell us about human nature.In other words, as you heard Chris say,I&#39;ve spent the last five yearsthinking about being wrong.This might strike you as a strange career move,but it actually has one great advantage:no job competition.(Laughter)In fact, most of us do everything we canto avoid thinking about being wrong,or at least to avoid thinking about the possibilitythat we ourselves are wrong.We get it in the abstract.We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.The human species, in general, is fallible — okay fine.
时间： 2:37
zh-cn:一旦这个想法临到我们自身我们现在所有的所有的信念对人类可能犯错的抽象概念随即被我们抛弃我无法想到我有哪里出错但是，我们活在现在我们开会，去家庭旅游去投票全都是现在式我们就像现在一个小泡泡里经历人生感觉自己总是对的
en:But when it comes down to me, right now,to all the beliefs I hold,here in the present tense,suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibilitygoes out the window —and I can&#39;t actually think of anything I&#39;m wrong about.And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.We go to meetings in the present tense;we go on family vacations in the present tense;we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,trapped in this little bubbleof feeling very right about everything.

zh-cn:我认为这是个问题我认为这是每个人私人生活和职业生活中的问题我认为我们身为群体，这也造成了文化问题于是，我今天想做的是先谈谈为甚么我们会陷在这种自以为是的心态中第二是为甚么这是个问题最后我想说服大家克服这种感觉是可能的而且一旦你做到了这将成为你道德上智性上和创意上最大的进步
en:I think this is a problem.I think it&#39;s a problem for each of us as individuals,in our personal and professional lives,and I think it&#39;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.So what I want to do todayis, first of all, talk about why we get stuckinside this feeling of being right.And second, why it&#39;s such a problem.And finally, I want to convince youthat it is possibleto step outside of that feelingand that if you can do so,it is the single greatestmoral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.

zh-cn:为甚么我们会陷在这种自以为是的心态中？事实上这和犯错的感觉有关我想问问你们让我问问台上的你们当你意识到自己犯错了你感觉如何？糟透了。很差劲。难堪。很好，是的。很糟糕，很差劲，很难堪。谢谢你们提供这些答案但这些答案没有回答我的问题你们回答的问题是：当你意识到你犯错的时候，你的感觉如何？（笑声）意识到你犯错了就会有刚刚所说的这些感觉，不是吗？令人沮丧，暴露了一些真实有时候甚至有些好笑像我误以为路牌是中文字但犯错本身事实上毫无感觉
en:So why do we get stuckin this feeling of being right?One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.So let me ask you guys something —or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you&#39;re right here:How does it feel — emotionally —how does it feel to be wrong?Dreadful. Thumbs down.Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing —thank you, these are great answers,but they&#39;re answers to a different question.You guys are answering the question:How does it feel to realize you&#39;re wrong?(Laughter)Realizing you&#39;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,it can actually be quite funny,like my stupid Chinese character mistake.But just being wrongdoesn&#39;t feel like anything.

zh-cn:让我给你一个例子你记得卡通里那个总是在追逐却从未抓到猎物的土狼吗？几乎在每一集里牠的猎物 － 一只走鹃鸟都会跳下悬崖反正牠是鸟，牠可以飞但土狼也会跟着牠一起跳崖那很好笑如果你是个六岁儿童土狼也很好牠就这么继续跑直到牠往下看发现自己漫步在空中这时候他才会往下掉在我们犯错时在我们意识到我们犯错时我们就像那只土狼还没意识到自己奔出悬崖我们已经错了已经惹上麻烦了但仍然感觉像走在地上我应该改变我之前的说法犯错的感觉就和正确的感觉一样
en:I&#39;ll give you an analogy.Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoonwhere there&#39;s this pathetic coyotewho&#39;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?In pretty much every episode of this cartoon,there&#39;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunnerand the roadrunner runs off a cliff,which is fine — he&#39;s a bird, he can fly.But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.And what&#39;s funny —at least if you&#39;re six years old —is that the coyote&#39;s totally fine too.He just keeps running —right up until the moment that he looks downand realizes that he&#39;s in mid-air.That&#39;s when he falls.When we&#39;re wrong about something —not when we realize it, but before that —we&#39;re like that coyoteafter he&#39;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down.You know, we&#39;re already wrong,we&#39;re already in trouble,but we feel like we&#39;re on solid ground.So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.It does feel like something to be wrong;it feels like being right.

zh-cn:事实上我们这种自以为对的感受是有构造性的原因的我称之为错误盲点大部份的时间里我们身体里没有任何机制提醒我们错了直到木已成舟但还有第二个理由文化性的理由回想小学时代你坐在课堂里你的老师发回小考考卷像这样的小考考卷虽然这张不是我的（笑声）你从小学时代就知道该对拿这张考卷的同学下甚么评语笨蛋，捣蛋鬼从不做功课的坏学生你不过才九岁你已经懂得，首先那些犯错的人都是懒惰、不负责任的傻瓜第二想要在人生中成功就不要犯错
en:So this is one reason, a structural reason,why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.I call this error blindness.Most of the time,we don&#39;t have any kind of internal cueto let us know that we&#39;re wrong about something,until it&#39;s too late.But there&#39;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well —and this one is cultural.Think back for a moment to elementary school.You&#39;re sitting there in class,and your teacher is handing back quiz papers,and one of them looks like this.This is not mine, by the way.(Laughter)So there you are in grade school,and you know exactly what to thinkabout the kid who got this paper.It&#39;s the dumb kid, the troublemaker,the one who never does his homework.So by the time you are nine years old,you&#39;ve already learned, first of all,that people who get stuff wrongare lazy, irresponsible dimwits —and second of all,that the way to succeed in lifeis to never make any mistakes.

zh-cn:我们很早就得到这些错误讯息而我们尤其是这个大厅里的许多人都因此成为好学生拿全A完美主义、永不满意不是吗？财务长、天体物理学家、超级马拉松先生们？（笑声）结果是你们全成了财务长、天体物理学家、跑超级马拉松那很好但一旦我们发现有可能犯错就开始手足无措因为依照规定犯错代表我们一定也有甚么不对劲于是我们坚持己见因为那让我们感觉聪明、得体安全和可靠
en:We learn these really bad lessons really well.And a lot of us —and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room —deal with them by just becomingperfect little A students,perfectionists, over-achievers.Right,Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?(Laughter)You&#39;re all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.Okay, so fine.Except that then we freak outat the possibility that we&#39;ve gotten something wrong.Because according to this,getting something wrongmeans there&#39;s something wrong with us.So we just insist that we&#39;re right,because it makes us feel smart and responsibleand virtuous and safe.

zh-cn:让我告诉你们一个故事几年前一个女人到 Beth Israel Deaconess 诊所做手术Beth Israel 在波士顿是哈佛大学的教学附属医院全国数一数二的医疗中心这个女人被送进开刀房麻醉，外科医生做完手术缝合，将她送进恢复室一切看上去都很好她醒来，往自己身上一看说“为甚么我的左腿绑着绷带？”她应该接受治疗的是右腿但为他做手术的外科医生却把刀开在左腿当副院长出来为医院的医疗质量和这次意外做出解释时他说了句很有趣的话他说“无论如何这位外科医生感觉他开下的刀是在正确的一侧”（笑声）故事的重点是相信自己的判断力相信自己站在对的一边是非常危险的
en:So let me tell you a story.A couple of years ago,a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.Beth Israel&#39;s in Boston.It&#39;s the teaching hospital for Harvard —one of the best hospitals in the country.So this woman comes in and she&#39;s taken into the operating room.She&#39;s anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing —stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.Everything seems to have gone fine.And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,and she says, &quot;Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?&quot;Well the wrong side of her body is in bandagesbecause the surgeon has performed a major operationon her left leg instead of her right one.When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israelspoke about this incident,he said something very interesting.He said, &quot;For whatever reason,the surgeon simply feltthat he was on the correct side of the patient.&quot;(Laughter)The point of this storyis that trusting too much in the feelingof being on the correct side of anythingcan be very dangerous.

zh-cn:我们心中时常感觉到的理直气壮的感觉在真实世界中并不是个可靠的向导。当我们依此行事不再思考我们是否犯错我们就有可能把两百湾加仑的石油倒进墨西哥湾或是颠覆世界经济这是个很实际的问题这也是个很大的社会问题
en:This internal sense of rightnessthat we all experience so oftenis not a reliable guideto what is actually going on in the external world.And when we act like it is,and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,well that&#39;s when we end up doing thingslike dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,or torpedoing the global economy.So this is a huge practical problem.But it&#39;s also a huge social problem.

zh-cn:“感觉对”究竟是什么意思这代表着你认为你的信念和真实是一致的当你有这种感觉的时候你的问题就大了因为如果你是对的为甚么还有人和你持不同意见？于是我们往往用同一种思考方式去解释这些异议第一是当他人不同意我们的说法我们便觉得他们无知他们不像我们懂得这么多当我们慷慨地和他们分享我们的知识他们便会理解，并加入我们的行列如果不是这样如果这些人和我们获得的信息一样多却仍然不认同我们我们便有了下一个定论那就是他们是白痴（笑声）他们已经有了所有的信息却笨到无法拼凑出正确的图像一旦第二个定论也不成立当这些反对我们的人和我们有一样的信息又聪明我们便有了第三个结论他们知道事实是甚么但却为了自己的好处故意曲解真实。这真是个大灾难
en:Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.It means that you think that your beliefsjust perfectly reflect reality.And when you feel that way,you&#39;ve got a problem to solve,which is, how are you going to explainall of those people who disagree with you?It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with usis we just assume they&#39;re ignorant.They don&#39;t have access to the same information that we do,and when we generously share that information with them,they&#39;re going to see the light and come on over to our team.When that doesn&#39;t work,when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we doand they still disagree with us,then we move on to a second assumption,which is that they&#39;re idiots.(Laughter)They have all the right pieces of the puzzle,and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.And when that doesn&#39;t work,when it turns out that people who disagree with ushave all the same facts we doand are actually pretty smart,then we move on to a third assumption:they know the truth,and they are deliberately distorting itfor their own malevolent purposes.So this is a catastrophe.

zh-cn:我们的自以为是让我们在最需要的时候无法预防犯错更让我们互相仇视对我来说最大的悲剧是它让我们错失了身为人的珍贵意义那就像是想象我们的心灵之窗完全透明我们向外观看描述在我们之前展开的世界我们想要每个人和我们有一样的窗子对世界做出一样的观察那不是真的如果是，人生将会多么无聊心灵的神奇之处不在你懂得这个世界是甚么样子而是去理解那些你不懂的地方我们记得过去思考未来我们想象自己成为他人，在他方我们的想象都有些不同于是当我们抬头看同一个夜空我们看到这个这个和这个这也是我们搞错事情的原因
en:This attachment to our own rightnesskeeps us from preventing mistakeswhen we absolutely need toand causes us to treat each other terribly.But to me, what&#39;s most bafflingand most tragic about thisis that it misses the whole point of being human.It&#39;s like we want to imaginethat our minds are just these perfectly translucent windowsand we just gaze out of themand describe the world as it unfolds.And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same windowand see the exact same thing.That is not true,and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.The miracle of your mindisn&#39;t that you can see the world as it is.It&#39;s that you can see the world as it isn&#39;t.We can remember the past,and we can think about the future,and we can imagine what it&#39;s liketo be some other person in some other place.And we all do this a little differently,which is why we can all look up at the same night skyand see thisand also thisand also this.And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.

en:1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thingabout &quot;I think therefore I am,&quot;this guy, St. Augustine, sat downand wrote &quot;Fallor ergo sum&quot; —&quot;I err therefore I am.&quot;Augustine understoodthat our capacity to screw up,it&#39;s not some kind of embarrassing defectin the human system,something we can eradicate or overcome.It&#39;s totally fundamental to who we are.Because, unlike God,we don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on out there.And unlike all of the other animals,we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.To me, this obsessionis the source and rootof all of our productivity and creativity.

zh-cn:因为一些缘故去年我在广播上听了很多集的&quot;我们的美国人生&quot;我听着听着突然发现这些故事全和犯错有关我的第一个念头是“我完了我写书写疯了四处都看到有关犯错的幻觉”说真的是这样但几个月后我访问了那个广播节目的主持人 Ira Glass我向他提到这件事他回答我“事实上你是对的”他说“我们这些工作人员总是开玩笑说每集节目之中的秘密主题都是一样的这个秘密主题就是&quot;我以为这件事会这样发生结果其它事情发生了&quot;他说&quot;但是，这就是我们需要的我们需要这些意外这些颠倒和错误这些故事才能成立。&quot;而我们身为观众听众、读者我们吸收这些故事我们喜欢故事转折令人惊讶的结局我们喜欢在故事里看到犯错
en:Last year, for various reasons,I found myself listening to a lot of episodesof the Public Radio show This American Life.And so I&#39;m listening and I&#39;m listening,and at some point, I start feelinglike all the stories are about being wrong.And my first thought was,&quot;I&#39;ve lost it.I&#39;ve become the crazy wrongness lady.I just imagined it everywhere,&quot;which has happened.But a couple of months later,I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who&#39;s the host of the show.And I mentioned this to him,and he was like, &quot;No actually, that&#39;s true.In fact,&quot; he says,&quot;as a staff, we jokethat every single episode of our showhas the same crypto-theme.And the crypto-theme is:&#39;I thought this one thing was going to happenand something else happened instead.&#39;And the thing is,&quot; says Ira Glass, &quot;we need this.We need these momentsof surprise and reversal and wrongnessto make these stories work.&quot;And for the rest of us, audience members,as listeners, as readers,we eat this stuff up.We love things like plot twistsand red herrings and surprise endings.When it comes to our stories,we love being wrong.
