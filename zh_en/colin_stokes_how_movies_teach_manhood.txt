zh-cn:身为父亲最让我开心的，就是可以看自己喜欢的电影。我喜欢跟我的孩子分享我的电影，当我的女儿四岁的时候，我们一起看了《绿野仙踪》。接下来几个月她完全被迷住了。她最喜欢的角色，当然是葛琳达（Glinda）。这让她把自己打扮的像仙女一样还拿着魔杖。
en:You know, my favorite part of being a dadis the movies I get to watch.I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,and when my daughter was four,we got to watch &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; together.It totally dominated her imagination for months.Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dressand carry a wand.

zh-cn:但是当你看了几遍之后，你就会发现这部电影是多么的与众不同。现在, 我们生活，抚养小孩,都是沉浸在一种儿童奇幻般复杂的世界里。但是《绿野仙踪》独树一帜。它并不属于那一类。这种趋势是四十年后的今天才流行的.很有意思的是, 另外一部电影里面有一个铁大个儿和一个毛绒绒的家伙伪装成敌人的守卫去解救一个女孩。你猜到这是哪部电影了么？（观众笑声）对的。
en:But you watch that movie enough times,and you start to realize how unusual it is.Now we live today, and are raising our children,in a kind of children&#39;s-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.But &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; stood alone.It did not start that trend.Forty years later was when the trend really caught on,with, interestingly, another moviethat featured a metal guyand a furry guyrescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy&#39;s guards.Do you know what I&#39;m talking about? (Laughter)Yeah.

zh-cn:这两部电影有很多不同，《绿野仙踪》跟我们近年来看到的所有电影在两三方面存在巨大的差异。首先，《绿野仙踪》没有什么暴力成分。猴子算是里面比较暴力的了，类似的还有苹果树。但是我想如果我们今天拍摄《绿野仙踪》，巫师会说：“多萝西（Dorothy），你是预言中拯救奥兹（Oz）的人，用你的魔法拖鞋去打败坏巫婆的（电脑生成的）军队吧。”但是，不是这样子的。
en:Now, there&#39;s a big difference between these two movies,a couple of really big differences between &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;and all the movies we watch today.One is there&#39;s very little violence in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.But I think if &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; were made today,the wizard would say, &quot;Dorothy, you are the savior of Ozthat the prophecy foretold.Use your magic slippers to defeatthe computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch.&quot;But that&#39;s not how it happens.

zh-cn:《绿野仙踪》的独特性还体现在片中绝大多数的英勇角色、智者、甚至坏人都是女性。
en:Another thing that&#39;s really unique about &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;to me is that all of the most heroicand wise and even villainous charactersare female.

zh-cn:我是在几年之后，跟我的女儿一起看《星球大战》的时候意识到这点的，那时候情况有些不同。那时我添了一个儿子。当时三岁。他还太小，所以我们没叫他一起看但是作为家里第二个孩子，对他的照看一下子就松了很多。（笑声）结果他也跑了进来，然后就入迷了就像是小鸭子一出生见到鸭妈妈一样，我不认为他看懂了这部电影的内容但是他显然已经沉迷其中了。
en:Now I started to notice thiswhen I actually showed &quot;Star Wars&quot; to my daughter,which was years later, and the situation was different.At that point I also had a son.He was only three at the time.He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.But he was the second child,and the level of supervision had plummeted. (Laughter)So he wandered in,and it imprinted on himlike a mommy duck does to its duckling,and I don&#39;t think he understands what&#39;s going on,but he is sure soaking in it.
时间： 2:37
zh-cn:我很好奇他喜欢这部电影的原因。是影片主题体现出来的勇气、毅力与忠诚？亦或是卢克（Luke）加入军队推翻政府的事实？还是说他意识到了整部电影中除了贝鲁阿姨（Aunt Beru）之外都是男孩？哦，当然还有公主是女性，很冷艳，但是她基本上只是跑个龙套在故事最后给英雄发放一个奖章，抛个媚眼感谢他拯救了世界，用他与生俱来的魔力。
en:And I wonder what he&#39;s soaking in.Is he picking up on the themes of courageand perseverance and loyalty?Is he picking up on the fact that Lukejoins an army to overthrow the government?Is he picking up on the fact thatthere are only boys in the universeexcept for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess,who&#39;s really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movieso that she can award the hero with a medal and a winkto thank him for saving the universe, which he doesby the magic that he was born with?

zh-cn:对比一下1939年的《绿野仙踪》。多萝西是如何取得胜利的？她通过跟每个人都成为好朋友变成他们的领袖。我更希望自己孩子可以在这样的环境中——奥兹的世界——长大，而不是打来打去的世界，——这种世界倒是很贴近现实。为什么我们给小孩子的电影中有那么多的暴力那么少的黄砖路（绿野仙踪中的道路）？
en:Compare this to 1939 with &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;How does Dorothy win her movie?By making friends with everybodyand being a leader.That&#39;s kind of the world I&#39;d rather raise my kids in —Oz, right? — and not the world of dudes fighting,which is where we kind of have to be.Why is there so much Force — capital F, Force —in the movies we have for our kids,and so little yellow brick road?

zh-cn:关于男性暴力电影对于女性的影响，有很多出色的分析文章，你应该去看看。写的很好。这种氛围对男孩的影响，我读的文章不多。就我自己的经验而言,从莱娅公主所处环境中得到的经验不足以指导我在现实生活中引导孩子进入成人世界成人世界是＂男女混居的＂。（笑声）我认为荧幕上的初吻应该发生在电影的最后，最好是演员表出现的时候,因为这是电影的结局，对么？我完成了使命，赢得芳心。为什么还要呆站在这里？我不知道应该做什么。
en:There is a lot of great writing about the impactthat the boy-violent movie has on girls,and you should do that reading. It&#39;s very good.I haven&#39;t read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.I know from my own experience thatPrincess Leia did not provide the adequate contextthat I could have used in navigating the adult worldthat is co-ed. (Laughter)I think there was a first-kiss momentwhen I really expected the credits to start rollingbecause that&#39;s the end of the movie, right?I finished my quest, I got the girl.Why are you still standing there?I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed to do.

zh-cn:这些电影把重点放在打败坏人获得奖励上，以至于没有多少时间处理其他关系和经历。基本上，如果你是男孩你就是一个呆笨的动物，如果你是女孩，你就应该穿上战袍。当然反例也很多，而且我会在你们面前为迪斯尼的公主们辩护。但是这些电影给男孩子的感觉是他们不是这些电影预期的观众这些电影有很大的一个功劳就是教会女孩子如何反抗父权社会,但是这些电影并没有向男孩子们展示如何反抗父权社会。孩子们没有偶像可寻。我们也有一些了不起的女性开始为我们的孩子写新的故事包括像赫敏和凯特里斯这样生动形象的角色，但是还是属于战争电影。当然，史上最成功的电影工作室（皮克斯）连续不断的创造经典电影每部电影都讲述一段故事一个小男孩的，或一个大男人的，或两个大男人，或父与子，或是两个男人抚养一个小女孩。终于，你们很多人都已经知道，今年他们终于推出了《勇敢传说》。我向你们所有人推荐这部电影。现在正在上映。你还记得《勇敢传说》刚上映时的批评么？“哦，不敢相信皮克斯也开始做公主电影了。”这很好。别止步。
en:The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villainand getting your reward, and there&#39;s not a lot of roomfor other relationships and other journeys.It&#39;s almost as though if you&#39;re a boy,you are a dopey animal,and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.There are plenty of exceptions,and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.But they do send a message to boys,that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girlshow to defend against the patriarchy,but they are not necessarily showing boyshow they&#39;re supposed to defend against the patriarchy.There&#39;s no models for them.And we also have some terrific womenwho are writing new stories for our kids,and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,these are still war movies.And, of course, the most successful studio of all timecontinues to crank out classic after classic,every single one of them aboutthe journey of a boy, or a man,or two men who are friends, or a man and his son,or two men who are raising a little girl.Until, as many of you are thinking, this year,when they finally came out with &quot;Brave.&quot;I recommend it to all of you. It&#39;s on demand now.Do you remember what the critics said when &quot;Brave&quot; came out?&quot;Aw, I can&#39;t believe Pixar made a princess movie.&quot;It&#39;s very good. Don&#39;t let that stop you.

zh-cn:现在，这些电影几乎都没有通过“贝克德尔测试”（Bechdel Test）。我不知道你们是否听说过,这个测试并不为人所知，但是今天或许我们能做些推动。艾莉森·贝克德尔是一个漫画作家，在80年代中期,，她记录下了她和一个朋友在评估她们看过的电影时的讨论内容。非常简单，只有三个问题：
en:Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard of this.It has not yet caught on and caught fire,but maybe today we will start a movement.Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist,and back in the mid-&#39;80s, she recorded this conversationshe&#39;d had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.And it&#39;s very simple. There&#39;s just three questions you should ask:
时间： 6:30
zh-cn:这部电影中是否有一个以上的角色是女性并且有台词？想想看这个标准。
en:Is there more than one character in the moviethat is female who has lines?So try to meet that bar.
时间： 6:39
zh-cn:如果是,这些女性角色在电影中是否交谈过？
en:And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?
时间： 6:44
zh-cn:如果交谈了，有没有跟她们共同的心上人无关的谈话内容？（笑声）
en:And is their conversation about something other thanthe guy that they both like? (Laughter)
时间： 6:51
zh-cn:明白了？谢谢。（掌声）非常感谢。
en:Right? Thank you. (Applause)Thank you very much.
时间： 6:57
zh-cn:两个女人，有台词，有交谈。确实有这样的电影。我看过，但是在我们看过的和喜欢的电影中是很少见的。
en:Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.It does happen. I&#39;ve seen it,and yet I very rarely see it in the moviesthat we know and love.
时间： 7:14
zh-cn:事实上，这个星期我刚看过一部质量不错的电影《阿尔戈》（Argo）。奥斯卡热门电影，票房很好，公认的好莱坞电影高品质电影。但是贝尔德尔测试不及格。我觉得这不应该。因为电影中的大部分情节不知道你们看过没有，电影中的大部分情节都发生在发生人质劫持事件的大使馆内，男人和女人都躲在里面。我们看到好几个场景，男人们在藏身处深刻而充满焦虑的对话。而电影中一个女演员最出彩的情节是隔着一扇门问道，“睡觉么，亲爱的？”这就是好莱坞。
en:In fact, this week I went to seea very high-quality movie, &quot;Argo.&quot;Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.And I don&#39;t think it should, because a lot of the movie,I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen it, but a lot of the movietakes place in this embassy where men and womenare hiding out during the hostage crisis.We&#39;ve got quite a few scenes of the menhaving deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,and the great moment for one of the actresses isto peek through the door and say, &quot;Are you coming to bed, honey?&quot;That&#39;s Hollywood for you.

zh-cn:来看看统计数字。2011年前100部最流行的电影中，有多少部电影有女主角？11部。不算太坏。就刚刚普选出的国会议员中女性议员比例而言，这个比例算好的。接下来这个比例比刚才的要高而这个比例会让在座各位震惊。
en:So let&#39;s look at the numbers.2011, of the 100 most popular movies,how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?Eleven. It&#39;s not bad.It&#39;s not as many percent as the number of womenwe&#39;ve just elected to Congress, so that&#39;s good.But there is a number that is greater than thisthat&#39;s going to bring this room down.

zh-cn:去年，纽约时报发表了一份由政府完成的报告。以下是内容。每五名美国女性中就有一位曾经遇到过性骚扰。
en:Last year, The New York Times published a studythat the government had done.Here&#39;s what it said.One out of five women in Americasay that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.
时间： 8:42
zh-cn:我不认为是流行娱乐圈的过错。我不认为这是由于儿童电影导致的。我甚至觉得色情音乐和电影跟这都没有直接关系，但是肯定哪里出问题了。当我听到这个统计数字，我当时想到的是性骚扰者的数量竟然这么多。他们是谁？他们怎么被教出来的？他们漏学了什么？他们有没有理解电影的情节，一个男性英雄打败了残暴的反派然后获得荣誉和奖励—就是一个没有朋友又不说话(没有思想)的女人?我们有没有从这些故事中吸取到什么？
en:Now, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the fault of popular entertainment.I don&#39;t think kids&#39; movies have anything to do with that.I don&#39;t even think thatmusic videos or pornography are really directly related to that,but something is going wrong,and when I hear that statistic,one of the things I think of isthat&#39;s a lot of sexual assailants.Who are these guys? What are they learning?What are they failing to learn?Are they absorbing the story thata male hero&#39;s job is to defeat the villain with violenceand then collect the reward, which is a womanwho has no friends and doesn&#39;t speak?Are we soaking up that story?

zh-cn:你知道，作为一名有着抚养女儿义务的父亲，我跟你们所有为人父母的人一样，对这个统计数字和这个世界存在危机感,我们要做好防范。我们创造了一些类似“少女超人”的角色，希望能够有所帮助，但是我担心，“女性力量”能否保护她们，同时, 有意无意地,我们培养我们的儿子们要有英勇气概?我的意思是，我觉得 Netflix Queue（一种看电影的服务）可以成为非常重要的一种方式，我主要是针对父亲说的。我认为我们应该为我们的男孩子们展示一种新的男子气概。
en:You know,as a parent with the privilegeof raising a daughterlike all of you who are doing the same thing,we find this world and this statistic very alarmingand we want to prepare them.We have tools at our disposal like &quot;girl power,&quot;and we hope that that will help,but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect themif, at the same time, actively or passively,we are training our sons to maintain their boy power?I mean, I think the Netflix queueis one way that we can do something very important,and I&#39;m talking mainly to the dads here.I think we have got to show our sonsa new definition of manhood.
时间：10:21
zh-cn:现在的男子气概的定义已经本末倒置了。你已经知道新的经济环境正在改变女性在家男性养家胡口的角色。他们正逐渐被替代。我们的儿子需要能够适应这些改变，适应相互之间的新关系，我认为我们需要身先士卒,展示如何成为一个真正的男人，他会信任他的姐妹尊重她们，希望与她们为伍，对抗真正的坏蛋，那些虐待妇女的大坏蛋。而且我认为我们需要在 Netflix Queue 中寻找符合贝尔德尔测试的电影，找到之后，再找出电影中的女英雄们,她们英勇无比，把大家团结起来，并且鼓励我们的儿子认识到这些女主人公的英勇并且说：“我想加入她的队伍。”因为他们将来需要与她们合作。
en:The definition of manhood is already turning upside down.You&#39;ve read about how the new economyis changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.They&#39;re throwing it up in the air.So our sons are going to have to find some wayof adapting to this, some new relationship with each other,and I think we really have to show them, and model for them,how a real manis someone who trusts his sistersand respects them, and wants to be on their team,and stands up against the real bad guys,who are the men who want to abuse the women.And I think our job in the Netflix queueis to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test,if we can find them, and to seek out the heroineswho are there,who show real courage, who bring people together,and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroinesand to say, &quot;I want to be on their team,&quot;because they&#39;re going to be on their team.

zh-cn:当我问我的女儿最喜欢《星球大战》中的哪个角色，你猜她说谁？欧比-旺（Obi-Wan）欧比-旺·克诺比和葛琳达他们有什么共同点？或许跟漂亮的衣服没有关系。我认为他们都是专家。两个人在各自的电影中都拥有比别人更多的知识，并且乐意与他人分享他们的知识帮助他人挖掘潜能。现在，他们是领袖。我希望自己的女儿有这样的追求，也希望自己的儿子有这样的追求。我希望这样的追求越多越好。我希望我的儿子不要被教育成“冲出去一个人战斗”而是主动的融入一个团队，或许由一个女性来指挥，帮助其他人成就自己，变得更好，就像奥兹仙女一样。谢谢。
en:When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in &quot;Star Wars,&quot;do you know what she said?Obi-Wan.Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.What do these two have in common?Maybe it&#39;s not just the sparkly dress.I think these people are experts.I think these are the two people in the moviewho know more than anybody else,and they love sharing their knowledge with other peopleto help them reach their potential.Now, they are leaders.I like that kind of quest for my daughter,and I like that kind of quest for my son.I want more quests like that.I want fewer quests where my son is told,&quot;Go out and fight it alone,&quot;and more quests where he sees that it&#39;s his job to join a team,maybe a team led by women,to help other people become betterand be better people,like the Wizard of Oz.Thank you.
