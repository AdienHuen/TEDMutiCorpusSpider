zh-cn:每四个人中就有一人患有某种精神疾病如果说是一二三四 就是你了先生对 是你（笑声）牙齿有点怪的那位 还有旁边那位(笑声)你自己可清楚了事实上那一整排都不大正常(笑声)这不太好 是的 真的很糟糕 拜托别看着我 (笑声)
en:One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness,so if it was one, two, three, four, it&#39;s you, sir.You. Yeah. (Laughter)With the weird teeth. And you next to him. (Laughter)You know who you are.Actually, that whole row isn&#39;t right. (Laughter)That&#39;s not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don&#39;t even look at me. (Laughter)

zh-cn:我就是四个人中的那一人 谢谢我想我这病是从我妈妈那里遗传过来的她常四肢着地在房子里四处爬动她手里拿着两个海绵 还有两个绑在膝盖那里 我妈妈具有完全的吸水性(笑声)她会跟在我身后爬来爬去喊着“谁会把脚印带到屋子里!”这算是个线索 有点不太对劲在我开始之前 我想感谢拉莫三嗪(Lamotrigine) 舍曲林(Sertraline) 帕罗西汀(Reboxetine)的制药商因为如果没有这几种常用药物 我今天就不会站在这里
en:I am one of the one in four. Thank you.I think I inherit it from my mother, who,used to crawl around the house on all fours.She had two sponges in her hand, and then she had twotied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent. (Laughter)And she would crawl around behind me going,&quot;Who brings footprints into a building?!&quot;So that was kind of a clue that things weren&#39;t right.So before I start, I would like to thankthe makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine,because without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today.

zh-cn:我的病是怎么开始的呢我的精神疾病 我都根本不想谈论它那我谈些什么好呢 好吧我以前常常会想自己最终会在什么时候发病可能因为我有深深的卡夫卡式存在主义的启示或可能是凯特•布兰切特扮演了我的角色并赢了奥斯卡(笑声)但这些都没发生 我发病的时候正是我女儿的运动会日所有家长都坐在停车场在车背上吃着食物 只是英国人吃着他们的香肠 他们可喜欢他们的香肠了(笑声)大家都在讲些闲话和八卦突然枪声响了 所有的女孩都跑了起来所有的妈妈都喊着 “快跑！快跑Chlamydia(人名 谐音衣原体)！快跑！”(笑声)“像风一样跑 Veruca(人名)! 快跑！”所有的女孩都在跑啊跑啊跑啊所有人除了我的女儿 她就站着在起跑线的地方 光顾着挥手因为她不知道她应该跑起来我因此卧床一个月 当我醒来的时候我发现自己住院了 看到其他病人的时候我意识到我找到自己的同类了 我的群落(笑声)因为他们成了我唯一的朋友 他们成了我的朋友因为我本来就认识不多人 而我也没有收到很多问候卡或鲜花 我的意思是 如果我是摔断了腿或者我有了孩子我也许就被大家的关心所掩埋了但我只接到了几通电话叫我振作振作因为我没想过要振作呢(笑声)(笑声)(掌声)
en:So how did it start?My mental illness — well, I&#39;m not even going to talk about my mental illness.What am I going to talk about? Okay.I always dreamt that, when I had my final breakdown,it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesqueexistentialist revelation,or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it. (Laughter)But that&#39;s not what happened. I had my breakdownduring my daughter&#39;s sports day.There were all the parents sitting in a parking loteating food out of the back of their car — only the English —eating their sausages. They loved their sausages. (Laughter)Lord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac,and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running,and all the mummies went, &quot;Run! Run Chlamydia! Run!&quot; (Laughter)&quot;Run like the wind, Veruca! Run!&quot;And all the girlies, girlies running, running, running,everybody except for my daughter, who was just standingat the starting line, just waving,because she didn&#39;t know she was supposed to run.So I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke upI found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates,I realized that I had found my people, my tribe. (Laughter)Because they became my only friends, they became my friends,because very few people that I knew — Well, I wasn&#39;tsent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken legor I was with child I would have been inundated,but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up.Perk up.Because I didn&#39;t think of that. (Laughter)(Laughter) (Applause)

zh-cn:因为有一样东西 得了这种病你会得到它这是整套附送的 就是你会感到很羞耻因为你的朋友们会说 “来 给我看看肿块给我看看X光片” 当然你什么都没有可以拿来展示的你就会变得很厌恶自己因为你觉得“没有很多人来看望我 我不是在城镇里生活”你开始听到很多谩骂声 不是一声两声你能听到近千个万个谩骂声就像恶魔患了抽动症 听起来就像那样但我们在座的都知道 并没有恶魔你的头脑中并没有声音当你听到那些谩骂声时所有那些小神经元会聚在一起 在那个小小的狭缝你就会产生“我真想杀了自己”有毒的化学物质如果这种情况屡次发生你可能会让自己得抑郁症那还不到冰山一角如果你有一个小婴儿 你常口头辱骂它它的小脑袋会发出非常具有破坏性的化学物质以致它脑袋里面分辨美好事物的部分不再生长了你就自己培养了一个精神病者如果一个士兵看到他的朋友被炸了 他的大脑会进入高度警戒状态以致他无法把所经历的东西用语言表达出来他只是一次又一次地感受到恐惧
en:Because, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease,this one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame,because your friends go, &quot;Oh come on, show me the lump,show me the x-rays,&quot; and of course you&#39;ve got nothing to show,so you&#39;re, like, really disgusted with yourself because you&#39;re thinking,&quot;I&#39;m not being carpet-bombed. I don&#39;t live in a township.&quot;So you start to hear these abusive voices, but you don&#39;t hear one abusive voice,you hear about a thousand — 100,000 abusive voices,like if the Devil had Tourette&#39;s, that&#39;s what it would sound like.But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil,there are no voices in your head.You know that when you have those abusive voices,all those little neurons get together and in that little gapyou get a real toxic &quot;I want to kill myself&quot; kind of chemical,and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape,you might have yourself depression.Oh, and that&#39;s not even the tip of the iceberg.If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally,its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructivethat the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn&#39;t grow,so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.If a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes intosuch high alarm that he can&#39;t actually put the experience into words,so he just feels the horror over and over again.

zh-cn:那么我有一个问题 我的问题就是 为什么人们有精神创伤的时候 总被认为是主动想象造成的为什么其它身体器官生病时你会得到同情 而大脑除外呢
en:So here&#39;s my question. My question is, how comewhen people have mental damage, it&#39;s always an active imagination?How come every other organ in your body can get sickand you get sympathy, except the brain?

zh-cn:我想谈多一些关于大脑的东西因为我知道TED在座的各位喜欢听请给我一点时间好吗我就这么说吧 有些好消息有些好消息 首先 我想说我们一路走来经历了很多我们从非常非常小的单细胞变形虫很小的 贴在一块石头上 现在 看啊 到了大脑我们开始吧 (笑声)这小东西有很大马力它是有完整意识的 它有新生的脑叶因为有枕叶所以我们能看到世界因为有颞叶所以我们能听到世界上的声音这里是我们有长期记忆的部分你很想忘记某天晚上真的喝醉了 拜拜 忘记了(笑声)事实上 大脑有1000亿个神经元带电吱吱吱地传导着信息吱吱吱吱 我来给你们看看一些侧观我不知道你们能不能看清楚(笑声)吱吱 那么(笑声)对每个 这是我自己画 谢谢对每一个神经元来说 你事实上可以有1万到10万种不同的连接或神经树突或不管你怎么叫 每一次你学到东西或经历了一些事树突就会成长 就是信息的树突你可以想象么 每个人都有那样的装备 甚至是帕丽斯·希尔顿(笑声)想想看
en:I&#39;d like to talk a little bit more about the brain,because I know you like that here at TED,so if you just give me a minute here, okay.Okay, let me just say, there&#39;s some good news.There is some good news. First of all, let me say,we&#39;ve come a long, long way.We started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba,tiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain.Here we go. (Laughter)This little baby has a lot of horsepower.It comes completely conscious. It&#39;s got state-of-the-art lobes.We&#39;ve got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world.We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world.Here we&#39;ve got a little bit of long-term memory,so, you know that night you want to forget, when you got really drunk? Bye-bye! Gone. (Laughter)So actually, it&#39;s filled with 100 billion neuronsjust zizzing away, electrically transmitting information,zizzing, zizzing. I&#39;m going to give you a little side view here.I don&#39;t know if you can get that here. (Laughter)So, zizzing away, and so — (Laughter) —And for every one — I know, I drew this myself. Thank you.For every one single neuron, you can actually havefrom 10,000 to 100,000 different connectionsor dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every timeyou learn something, or you have an experience,that bush grows, you know, that bush of information.Can you imagine, every human being is carryingthat equipment, even Paris Hilton? (Laughter)Go figure.

zh-cn:我这里也有些坏消息想对你们说 我有些坏消息比例不是四分之一 而是四分之四我们还没准备好过21世纪进化并没有帮我们做好准备 我们没有相关的连接对于那些人说他们过了美好的一天说他们过得非常好 他们比我们其他人还要疯狂因为我会给你们看哪里会有些进化的故障 好 让我解释给你们听当我们是古人的时候(笑声)几百万年以前 我们突然受到捕食者的威胁 好吗 (笑声)我们会 谢谢 我自己画的(笑声)非常感谢 谢谢 谢谢 (掌声)谢谢 不管怎么说 我们会激增自己的肾上腺素和提脂醇 然后我们会展开杀戮或被杀我们会进食或被食 我们会瞬间发泄出这些化学物质然后我们回到正常 好的问题是 现在的现代人(笑声)当我们感到危险时 我们依然激增身体的化学物质但因为我们不能杀掉交通管制员(笑声)或吃掉地产经纪人 这些物质一直在我们的身体里面反反复复地 所以我们一直处在持续警惕的状态一个持续的状态 然后发生了另一件事大概15万年前 语言开始形成我们开始把这种持续警惕的状态用语言表达出来不止是 “我的天啊 有只剑齿虎”它可以突然是 “我的天 我没发邮件 我的天 我的大腿好粗我的天啊 每个人都知道我犯蠢了 我没被邀请去圣诞派对！”你不停地有这唠叨的卷带放着一遍又一遍地把你逼疯了 那么你看到问题所在了吗 曾经让你感到安全的东西现在正把你逼疯我很抱歉做了坏消息的信者 但有人得告诉你你的宠物比你更快乐 (笑声)(掌声)小猫咪 喵 快乐快乐快乐 人类 完蛋了 (笑声)完完全全 彻彻底底地 完蛋了
en:But I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news.This isn&#39;t for the one in four. This is for the four in four.We are not equipped for the 21st century.Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don&#39;t have the bandwidth,and for people who say, oh, they&#39;re having a nice day,they&#39;re perfectly fine, they&#39;re more insane than the rest of us.Because I&#39;ll show you where there might be a few glitchesin evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you.When we were ancient man — (Laughter) —millions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatenedby a predator, okay? — (Laughter) —we would — Thank you. I drew these myself. (Laughter)Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenalineand our own cortisol, and then we&#39;d kill or be killed,we&#39;d eat or we&#39;d be eaten, and then suddenly we&#39;d de-fuel,and we&#39;d go back to normal. Okay.So the problem is, nowadays, with modern man— (Laughter) —when we feel in danger, we still fill up with our own chemicalbut because we can&#39;t kill traffic wardens — (Laughter) —or eat estate agents, the fuel just stays in our bodyover and over, so we&#39;re in a constant state of alarm,a constant state. And here&#39;s another thing that happened.About 150,000 years ago, when language came online,we started to put words to this constant emergency,so it wasn&#39;t just, &quot;Oh my God, there&#39;s a saber-toothed tiger,&quot;which could be, it was suddenly, &quot;Oh my God, I didn&#39;t send the email. Oh my God, my thighs are too fat.Oh my God, everybody can see I&#39;m stupid. I didn&#39;t get invited to the Christmas party!&quot;So you&#39;ve got this nagging loop tape that goesover and over again that drives you insane, so,you see what the problem is? What once made you safenow drives you insane.I&#39;m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somebody has to be.Your pets are happier than you are. (Laughter)(Applause)So kitty cat, meow, happy happy happy, human beings, screwed. (Laughter)Completely and utterly — so, screwed.

zh-cn:我认为 如果我们不谈论这些问题如果我们不学会处理我们的生活 那就不会再是四个中一个有问题 而是四个里面全都有问题他们真的会生病住进高层病房如果真的发生了 我们可不可以不再冠以污名谢谢（掌声）（掌声）谢谢
en:But my point is, if we don&#39;t talk about this stuff,and we don&#39;t learn how to deal with our lives, it&#39;s not goingto be one in four. It&#39;s going to be four in fourwho are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department.And while we&#39;re at it, can we please stop the stigma?Thank you. (Applause)(Applause) Thank you.
