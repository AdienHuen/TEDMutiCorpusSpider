zh-cn:美国的孩子们长大成人的道路上，有两个机构在这段旅程上至关重要。第一个是大家经常听到的：大学。某些人可能还记得当你第一次进入大学时的兴奋的感觉你们中的某些可能现在就在大学并且正在享受那份兴奋
en:On the path that American children travel to adulthood,two institutions oversee the journey.The first is the one we hear a lot about: college.Some of you may rememberthe excitement that you feltwhen you first set off for college.Some of you may be in college right nowand you&#39;re feeling this excitementat this very moment.

zh-cn:大学有很多弊端学费昂贵，所以年轻人负债累累但总而言之，这是一条康庄大道年轻人从校园毕业，带着自豪与友情和许多关于这个世界的知识或许更重要的是上大学使得他们能有更好的就业机会
en:College has some shortcomings.It&#39;s expensive; it leavesyoung people in debt.But all in all, it&#39;s a pretty good path.Young people emerge from collegewith pride and with great friendsand with a lot of knowledge about the world.And perhaps most importantly,a better chance in the labor marketthan they had before they got there.

zh-cn:今天我想讨论的是第二个机构在美国，贯穿了从童年到成年的整个人生经历那个机构便是监狱在这段旅程上,相伴着年轻人的是感化官而不是教师去法庭受审而不是去教室上课他们的大三留学之旅是去州立管教所当他们20多岁时没有商科的或英语的学位有的只是犯罪记录
en:Today I want to talk aboutthe second institutionoverseeing the journey from childhoodto adulthood in the United States.And that institution is prison.Young people on this journeyare meeting with probation officersinstead of with teachers.They&#39;re going to court datesinstead of to class.Their junior year abroad is insteada trip to a state correctional facility.And they&#39;re emerging from their 20snot with degrees in business and English,but with criminal records.

zh-cn:这个机构同样花费甚多在新泽西，送一个年轻人到监狱的花费一年要大约4万美元但是这是纳税人买的单而孩子们得到的只是一个冰冷的牢房单间和一个永久的印记，阻碍着他们回归家庭或者寻找工作
en:This institution is also costing us a lot,about 40,000 dollars a yearto send a young personto prison in New Jersey.But here, taxpayers are footing the billand what kids are gettingis a cold prison celland a permanent mark against themwhen they come homeand apply for work.

zh-cn:越来越多的孩子在这条路上长大成人尤其在美国，这是因为在过去的四十年里我们服刑率已经增长了700%我制作了一张幻灯片看这儿这是我们的服刑率每十万人就有716人服刑这是其他OECD（经合组织）成员国家的情况
en:There are more and more kidson this journey to adulthoodthan ever before in the United Statesand that&#39;s because in the past 40 years,our incarceration rate has grown by 700 percent.I have one slide for this talk.Here it is.Here&#39;s our incarceration rate,about 716 people per 100,000in the population.Here&#39;s the OECD countries.

zh-cn:更为重要的是，被送入监狱的孩子往往家境贫寒他们大多来自非裔美国人和拉丁裔社区以至于监狱成为了想要成功的年轻人实现美国梦的障碍问题是事实更为糟糕因为我们不只是把贫困的孩子送入监狱我们还给他们加上了许多沉重的枷锁，比如诉讼费的负担比如感化和假释的限制比如轻微的犯罪通缉我们让他们待在过渡教习所或者软禁在家我们让他们和警察交涉而当这些警察要进入有色人种的社区不是为了改善公共安全而是为了政绩去保证逮捕数量
en:What&#39;s more, it&#39;s poor kidsthat we&#39;re sending to prison,too many drawn from African-Americanand Latino communitiesso that prison now stands firmly betweenthe young people trying to make itand the fulfillment of the American Dream.The problem&#39;s actually a bit worse than this&#39;cause we&#39;re not just sending poor kids to prison,we&#39;re saddling poor kids with court fees,with probation and parole restrictions,with low-level warrants,we&#39;re asking them to live in halfway houses and on house arrest,and we&#39;re asking them to negotiate a police forcethat is entering poorcommunities of color,not for the purposes of promoting public safety,but to make arrest counts,to line city coffers.

zh-cn:这就是关于我们印象中的惩戒措施的不为人知的一面年轻人总是担心随时会被截停、搜身和逮捕无论是在街上还是在家在学校还是在工作
en:This is the hidden underside to ourhistoric experiment in punishment:young people worried that at any moment,they will be stopped, searched and seized.Not just in the streets, but in their homes,at school and at work.

zh-cn:大约2000年年初的时候当时我自己在宾夕法尼亚大学上学我对这种别样的人生成长轨迹产生了兴趣大学坐落在一个历史悠久的非裔社区旁所以在这里你能同时看到两条平行的人生轨迹一边是在这所精英的私立大学上学的孩子另外一边是在附近社区的孩子他们中有一些也在努力去读大学但是他们中的大多数却身陷囹圄
en:I got interested in this other path to adulthoodwhen I was myself a college studentattending the University of Pennsylvaniain the early 2000s.Penn sits within a historic African-American neighborhood.So you&#39;ve got these two paralleljourneys going on simultaneously:the kids attending this elite, private university,and the kids from the adjacent neighborhood,some of whom are making it to college,and many of whom are being shipped to prison.

zh-cn:在我大二的时候，我开始辅导一位高中的年轻姑娘她住在离大学10分钟路程的地方不久，她的表弟（堂弟）从少年拘留所回到家他当时15岁，上高中一年级我开始了解他以及他的朋友们和家庭我问他能否在我的毕业论文中讲述他的生活这篇论文也成为了我在普林斯顿的博士论文现在则集结成书
en:In my sophomore year, I started tutoringa young woman who was in high schoolwho lived about 10 minutesaway from the university.Soon, her cousin came home from a juvenile detention center.He was 15, a freshman in high school.I began to get to know him and his friends and family,and I asked him what he thought about me writing about his lifefor my senior thesis in college.This senior thesis becamea dissertation at Princetonand now a book.

zh-cn:去尝试理解年轻人在成长中要面对的是什么在这个社区中生活的第一周我看到了两个男孩，一个5岁一个7岁在玩一个追逐游戏大一点的男孩在追另外一个他演“警察”当“警察”抓到了小一点的男孩他把小男孩按到身下假装用手铐把他铐起来然后从小男孩的口袋里掏出一个25分硬币说到：“这个归我了”他问他是否带了毒品是否在被通缉我经常看到孩子们玩儿这个游戏有时候，孩子们只是简单的放弃逃跑平躺在地上双手高举过头顶，或是将双手靠在墙上孩子们彼此大叫“我要把你锁起来，我要把你锁起来让你再也回不了家！“有一次我看到一个6岁小孩把另外一个小孩的裤子扒掉然后去试着去做肛门搜查
en:trying to understand what young peoplewere facing as they came of age.The first week I spentin this neighborhood,I saw two boys, five and seven years old,play this game of chase,where the older boyran after the other boy.He played the cop.When the cop caught upto the younger boy,he pushed him down,handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs,took a quarter out of the other child&#39;s pocket,saying, &quot;I&#39;m seizing that.&quot;He asked the child if he was carrying any drugsor if he had a warrant.Many times, I saw this game repeated,sometimes children would simply give up running,and stick their bodies flat against the groundwith their hands above their heads,or flat up against a wall.Children would yell at each other,&quot;I&#39;m going to lock you up,I&#39;m going to lock you upand you&#39;re never coming home!&quot;Once I saw a six-year-old childpull another child&#39;s pants downand try to do a cavity search.

zh-cn:在住在这个社区的最初的18个月我记下了所有我看到的我的邻居与警察的接触所以在这最初的18个月我看到了警察截停行人或者在车里的人搜查他们，询问他们的姓名在街上追逐他们抓他们去问话每天都要抓一个人，只有5天例外我看到警察破门而入多达52次穿过很多屋子去追捕或者在某人家中将其逮捕我看到警察在逮捕这些年轻人之后又用极端暴力对待他们在这一年半时间中我一共看到14次
en:In the first 18 months that I livedin this neighborhood,I wrote down every time I sawany contact between policeand people that were my neighbors.So in the first 18 months,I watched the police stop pedestrians or people in cars,search people, run people&#39;s names,chase people through the streets,pull people in for questioning,or make an arrest every single day,with five exceptions.Fifty-two times, I watched the policebreak down doors,chase people through housesor make an arrest of someonein their home.Fourteen timesin this first year and a half,I watched the police punch, choke,kick, stomp on or beat young menafter they had caught them.

zh-cn:逐渐的，我和两兄弟熟悉起来查克和提姆我们相识时查克18岁，是一个高四学生他在一个篮球队打球，大部分成绩是C和B他的小弟弟，提姆，当时10岁提姆很喜欢查克，经常跟着他屁股后面转把查克当成他的导师他们和母亲与爷爷（姥爷）住在一起他们住在一个两层楼的联排房屋里，前面有草坪，后面有走廊他们成长过程中，他们的母亲一直都为毒瘾所扰她从来没能有个长期的稳定工作是他们祖父（外祖父）的退休金在支撑这个家其实这不足以支付孩子们的食品和衣服还有学习开销真的是在贫困线上挣扎
en:Bit by bit, I got to know two brothers,Chuck and Tim.Chuck was 18 when we met,a senior in high school.He was playing on the basketball teamand making C&#39;s and B&#39;s.His younger brother, Tim, was 10.And Tim loved Chuck;he followed him around a lot,looked to Chuck to be a mentor.They lived with their mom and grandfatherin a two-story row home with a front lawn and a back porch.Their mom was struggling with addictionall while the boys were growing up.She never really was able to hold down a job for very long.It was their grandfather&#39;s pensionthat supported the family,not really enough to payfor food and clothesand school supplies for growing boys.The family was really struggling.

zh-cn:当我们认识的时候，查克正在上高中最后一年他刚刚满18岁那个冬天，一个操场上的孩子叫查克的妈妈”嗑药的婊子“查克把那孩子的脸按到积雪里然后校警以严重袭击的罪名将他逮捕然而骂人的孩子第二天没什么事我想主要是他的自尊心受到了伤害
en:So when we met, Chuck wasa senior in high school.He had just turned 18.That winter, a kid in the schoolyardcalled Chuck&#39;s mom a crack whore.Chuck pushed the kid&#39;s face into the snowand the school cops charged him with aggravated assault.The other kid was fine the next day,I think it was his pride that was injuredmore than anything.
时间： 7:28
zh-cn:但是无论如何，查克已经年满18岁他因为袭击案被送到成人监狱位于费城东北部的州立公路旁他因为无力支付保释金被关在那—-他根本就付不起当时审判日被一拖再拖几乎占了他高中最后的一整年最后，在接近这个季节末的时候法官驳回了大部分关于这起袭击案的指控查克回家了但是他也欠下了数百美元的诉讼费提姆那天很开心
en:But anyway, since Chuck was 18,this agg. assault case sent him to adult county jailon State Road in northeast Philadelphia,where he sat, unable to pay the bail —he couldn&#39;t afford it —while the trial dates dragged on and on and onthrough almost his entire senior year.Finally, near the end of this season,the judge on this assault casethrew out most of the chargesand Chuck came homewith only a few hundred dollars&#39; worthof court fees hanging over his head.Tim was pretty happy that day.

zh-cn:第二年秋天，查克试着去重新注册高中四年级但是学校秘书告诉他他已经19岁了，已经超龄而没有资格复读了紧接着，负责他袭击案的法官又签署了一份他的通缉因为他没有付225美元的诉讼费在他案子结束后的几个星期后发出所以他从高中辍学在逃去躲避追捕
en:The next fall, Chuck tried to re-enroll as a senior,but the school secretary told him thathe was then 19 and too old to be readmitted.Then the judge on his assault caseissued him a warrant for his arrestbecause he couldn&#39;t pay the 225 dollars in court feesthat came due a few weeks afterthe case ended.Then he was a high school dropoutliving on the run.

zh-cn:提姆第一次被捕是在那一年的晚些时候那时他刚满11岁那时查克的通缉刚被取消然后他要以分期付款的方式支付他的诉讼费当时他用他女友的车载提姆到学校一个警察把他们截停，调查车的来源发现车是在加州被盗的查克根本就不知道这辆车其实是赃物是他女友的叔叔在一个费城东北的二手车拍卖会上买的查克和提姆从来没有离开过附近超过三个州更别提加州了但是尽管如此，当地辖区的警察还是以窝赃的罪名起诉了查克几天后，一个青少年犯罪法官起诉了11岁的提姆作为窝赃的从犯然后他被判三年的缓刑因为背负缓刑的罪名
en:Tim&#39;s first arrest came later that yearafter he turned 11.Chuck had managedto get his warrant liftedand he was on a payment planfor the court feesand he was driving Tim to schoolin his girlfriend&#39;s car.So a cop pulls them over, runs the car,and the car comes up as stolen in California.Chuck had no idea where in the historyof this car it had been stolen.His girlfriend&#39;s uncle bought itfrom a used car auctionin northeast Philly.Chuck and Tim had never beenoutside of the tri-state,let alone to California.But anyway, the cops down at the precinctcharged Chuck with receiving stolen property.And then a juvenile judge, a few days later,charged Tim, age 11,with accessory to receivinga stolen propertyand then he was placed on three years of probation.With this probation sentence hanging over his head,

zh-cn:查克要他弟弟坐下来开始教他怎么摆脱警察他们会肩并肩坐在他们房后的走廊望着公共小巷的深处查克会叫提姆怎样辩认出伪装的警车怎样和深夜巡逻的警察交涉，还有哪里能躲避
en:Chuck sat his little brother downand began teaching himhow to run from the police.They would sit side by side on their back porchlooking out into the shared alleywayand Chuck would coach Timhow to spot undercover cars,how to negotiate a late-night police raid,how and where to hide.

zh-cn:我想让你们想象一下如果查克和提姆住在邻居孩子都能去大学读书，而不是去监狱的社区里就像我长大的社区他们的生活会是怎样？好的，你也许会说但是像查克和提姆这样的孩子，他们确实犯罪了！难道他们不该去蹲监狱吗？难道他们不该生活在被捕的恐惧之中吗？我的答案是不该他们不应该被这样对待他们不应该因为做了和其他年轻人一样的事而被这样对待比他们条件更好的年轻人做同样的事却免受惩罚如果查克去了我的高中那次操场打架也只会作为一次操场打架而止于学校内部根本就不会成为一起严重袭击案件从来就没有任何一位我的大学同学现在有犯罪记录从来没有一个但是你能想象如果警察截停这些上学路上的孩子从他们的口袋中搜查毒品或者在半夜突击检查他们的朋友聚会，他们会留下多少犯罪记录吗？
en:I want you to imagine for a secondwhat Chuck and Tim&#39;s lives would be likeif they were living in a neighborhoodwhere kids were going to college,not prison.A neighborhood like the one I got to grow up in.Okay, you might say.But Chuck and Tim, kids like them,they&#39;re committing crimes!Don&#39;t they deserve to be in prison?Don&#39;t they deserve to be living in fear of arrest?Well, my answer would be no.They don&#39;t.And certainly not for the same things that other young peoplewith more privilege are doingwith impunity.If Chuck had gone to my high school,that schoolyard fight would have ended there,as a schoolyard fight.It never would have becomean aggravated assault case.Not a single kid thatI went to college withhas a criminal record right now.Not a single one.But can you imagine how many might haveif the police had stopped those kidsand searched their pockets for drugsas they walked to class?Or had raided their frat partiesin the middle of the night?

zh-cn:好的，你也许会说但是高服刑率不是一定程度上降低了犯罪率吗？犯罪率下降了，这是好事。没错，犯罪率下降是好事。从90年代到本世纪初，犯罪率大幅下降但是根据一个由国家科学院去年召开的学术会议的测算我们历史上高服刑率和我们的低犯罪率的关系并不十分牢靠犯罪率的高低和我们送多少年轻人进监狱并无关系
en:Okay, you might say.But doesn&#39;t this high incarceration ratepartly account for our really low crime rate?Crime is down. That&#39;s a good thing.Totally, that is a good thing.Crime is down.It dropped precipitously inthe &#39;90s and through the 2000s.But according to a committee of academicsconvened by the National Academyof Sciences last year,the relationship between ourhistorically high incarceration ratesand our low crime rate is pretty shaky.It turns out that the crime rategoes up and downirrespective of how many young peoplewe send to prison.

zh-cn:我们总是在一个狭窄的范围下思考正义好或者坏，无罪或者有罪不正义就是被错误的定罪所以如果你因为自己做过的事被定罪你就应该受到相应的惩罚总是用无辜的和有罪的人总是有被害者和犯罪者如果我们能再思考地更广一点
en:We tend to think about justicein a pretty narrow way:good and bad, innocent and guilty.Injustice is about being wrongfully convicted.So if you&#39;re convicted of something you did do,you should be punished for it.There are innocent and guilty people,there are victims and there are perpetrators.Maybe we could think a little bitmore broadly than that.

zh-cn:现在，我们却要求这些住在最恶劣的社区的小孩他们只有最少的家庭资源他们上着全国最差的学校他们面对着劳动力市场的最艰难的时刻他们住在每天都有暴力问题发生的社区我们却要求他们实现几乎不可能完成的事情不允许一丝错误
en:Right now, we&#39;re asking kids who livein the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,who have the least amountof family resources,who are attending the country&#39;s worst schools,who are facing the toughest timein the labor market,who are living in neighborhoodswhere violence is an everyday problem,we&#39;re asking these kids to walkthe thinnest possible line —to basically never do anything wrong.

zh-cn:为什么我们不提供给这些孩子面对这些挑战的帮助呢？为什么我们提供的只有手铐，监狱和逃亡生活呢？我们就不能想象一点更好的事情吗？难道我们就不能想象一个重视重归社会重视预防犯罪和城市包容性而不是只重视惩罚的司法系统吗？（鼓掌）这个司法系统承认有色人种在美国被隔离和疏远的历史并且不会再促进和保持这种隔离和疏远（鼓掌）最终，这个司法系统更信任这些黑人青年而不是不是把这些黑人青年当作敌人来对待（鼓掌）
en:Why are we not providing supportto young kids facing these challenges?Why are we offering only handcuffs,jail time and this fugitive existence?Can we imagine something better?Can we imagine a criminal justice systemthat prioritizes recovery,prevention, civic inclusion,rather than punishment?(Applause)A criminal justice system that acknowledgesthe legacy of exclusion that poor peopleof color in the U.S. have facedand that does not promoteand perpetuate those exclusions.(Applause)And finally, a criminal justice systemthat believes in black young people,rather than treating black young people as the enemy to be rounded up.(Applause)

zh-cn:好消息是，我们已经在努力之中几年前，米歇尔亚历山大撰写了《The New Jim Crow》这本书这本书让美国人认识到服刑率在历史上也是一个重要的人权问题，而且是前所未见的总统奥巴马和首席检察官埃里克候得对于量刑改革以及在量刑中的种族不平等十分的重视我们看到有些州开始禁止截查和搜身因为这些侵犯了人权我们看到有些州和城市拥有大麻合法化他们是纽约，新泽西和加利福尼亚这些措施减少了他们的服刑人数，关闭了一些监狱但是于此同时犯罪率也大幅地降低了德克萨斯也开始了相同的举措同样关闭监狱，投资教育一个从左派到右派的奇异的联盟正在建立起来成员有前服刑人员和财政保守派还有人权活动家和自由主义者年轻人走上大街去抗议那些暴力对待手无寸铁的黑人青少年的警察而年长的，富有的人——有一些是我们这里的观众——也捐助了巨额资金到这些反监禁的活动中在严重分离的国会司法系统变革的工作也是唯一一个能让左派和右派走到一起的工作
en:The good news is that we already are.A few years ago, Michelle Alexanderwrote &quot;The New Jim Crow,&quot;which got Americans to see incarceration as a civil rights issueof historic proportions in a waythey had not seen it before.President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have come out very stronglyon sentencing reform,on the need to address racial disparity in incarceration.We&#39;re seeing states throw outStop and Friskas the civil rights violation that it is.We&#39;re seeing cities and statesdecriminalize possession of marijuana.New York, New Jerseyand Californiahave been dropping their prison populations, closing prisons,while also seeing a big drop in crime.Texas has gotten into the game now,also closing prisons, investing in education.This curious coalition is building from the right and the left,made up of former prisonersand fiscal conservatives,of civil rights activistsand libertarians,of young people taking to the streetsto protest police violenceagainst unarmed black teenagers,and older, wealthier people —some of you are here in the audience —pumping big money into decarceration initiativesIn a deeply divided Congress,the work of reforming our criminal justice systemis just about the only thingthat the right and the leftare coming together on.

zh-cn:我并不认为在我的有生之年能看到这个政治时刻的到来我想很多正在不止疲倦的书写关于我们历史性的高服刑率的起因和结果的人也不会认为能在有生之年能看到这个时刻的来临现在我们的问题是，我们究竟能达成多少目标？我们究竟能改变到何种程度？
en:I did not think I would seethis political moment in my lifetime.I think many of the peoplewho have been working tirelesslyto write about the causes and consequencesof our historically high incarceration ratesdid not think we would seethis moment in our lifetime.The question for us now is,how much can we make of it?How much can we change?

zh-cn:最后，我想对年轻人呼吁对正在上大学的年轻人对正在监狱外挣扎抗争的年轻人对服刑结束重返家庭的年轻人这也许看上去是几种完全不同的成人之路但是年轻人参加这两种机构最终成人他们有着共同点：他们都可以成为重建我们司法系统的工作的领导者青年们永远都是为了公平权利的斗争为了更多的人赢得尊严的斗争为了自由的机会的斗争的领导者赋予给这一代青年的使命在这个即将到来的时代，历史性的时刻，终结高服刑率，建造一个能充分表达“正义”这个词的全新的司法系统
en:I want to end with a call to young people,the young people attending collegeand the young peoplestruggling to stay out of prisonor to make it through prisonand return home.It may seem like these pathsto adulthood are worlds apart,but the young people participatingin these two institutionsconveying us to adulthood,they have one thing in common:Both can be leaders in the workof reforming our criminal justice system.Young people have always been leadersin the fight for equal rights,the fight for more people to be granted dignityand a fighting chance at freedom.The mission for the generation of young peoplecoming of age in this, a sea-changemoment, potentially,is to end mass incarceration and build a new criminal justice system,emphasis on the word justice.
