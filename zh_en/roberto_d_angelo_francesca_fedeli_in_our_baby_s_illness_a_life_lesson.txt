zh-cn:弗朗西斯卡 费德利：大家好！他是马里奥，我们的儿子他出生两年半了我怀孕期间很艰难因为我必须在呆在床上，有八个月的样子但最后一切看起来都还好他出生时体重达标阿普达评分也正常所以当时我们很放心但后来，他出生后的第十天我们发现他中风了你也许知道中风是一种大脑损伤围产期中风可能在怀孕的九个月期间发生或者是在生产之后突然发生你可以看到，马里奥的情况是他右边的大脑没了所以这次中风对马里奥的身体可能产生的影响是他或许不能够控制他左侧的身体想象一下，假如你有一台电脑和一台打印机你要传送资料，要输入并打印一份文件但是打印机没有合适的驱动马里奥德情况正是如此就像是，他想运动他的左侧身体但他没法传送正确的输入信号来运动他的左胳膊和左腿因此，生活必须改变我们需要改变我们的日程表我们需要改变这次生育对我们生活的影响罗伯特 D安吉洛：也许你们能想象得到不幸的是，我们还没有做好准备没人教我们怎样处理这样的残疾接着很多的问题开始出现涌向心头那段时期真的很难熬一些基本的问题：比如说，为什么这要发生在我们头上还有哪里出了问题？还有一些更艰难的问题，真的像这会对马里奥的生活产生什么影响？我意思是说：他最终能否参加工作？他能正常地生活吗？还有，作为一名家长，尤其是第一次当家长为什么事情不能变得好起来？还有一个真的很难说出口的但数月之后，我们意识到我们真的感觉像是一个失败者就是说我们生活唯一真实的结晶竟然最终是个失败品尽管对我们而言，他本身不是一个失败品但他的全部生活都要受此影响坦诚而言，我们感觉很失落是非常失落，但最终我们开始注视马里奥我们说着：我们必须行动起来所以，就像弗朗西斯卡说的，我们改变了我们的生活我们开始进行物理疗法，我们开始康复治疗其中我们遵循的一种方法就康复治疗而言，是镜像神经元引导我们基本上花了数月时间对马里奥做这个你拿着一个物体，然后我们给他展示如何抓取这个物体今天，镜像神经元理论只是说就是现在，当你看我做这个的时候，你的大脑也会激活相同的神经元就像是你在做这样的动作这看起来似乎是康复治疗的最前沿了但是有一天我们发现马里奥没有在看我们的手他在看着我们我们是他的镜像问题是，或许你能感觉到我们很低迷，很沮丧我们把他当作一个问题来对待而不是一个儿子，不是从一个积极的方面那一天真的改变了我们的观念我们意识到必须成为马里奥更好的镜像我们恢复了自己的力量同时我们也恢复了马里奥的力量我们不再把他当作一个问题来看待我们开始把他看作一个进步的机遇真的，这就是我们说的改变在我们这边，我们问道“我们究竟可以为马里奥带来什么力量？”然后我们从我们热情开始我的意思是，最后，妻子和我有很大的不同但我们也有很多相同之处我们喜爱旅游，我们热爱音乐我们喜欢来到像这样的地方然后我们开始带上马里奥在我们力所能及的情况下，给他看最好的东西这是上周的一个短视频我没说....掌声 —-我没说这是一个奇迹。那不是我们要表达的因为我们只是刚刚开始但是我们想跟大家分享重要的领悟马里奥带给我们的领悟那就是把你所拥有的当作礼物来看待而不只是你所失去的把你所失去的当作一次机遇这就是我们想要跟大家分享的东西这就是我们来到这里的原因马里奥！这就是为什么 ...掌声 —-这就是为什么我们决定把世界上最好的镜像与他分享我们非常感谢大家，所有人谢谢！谢谢！拜！掌声谢谢大家！
en:Francesca Fedeli: Ciao.So he&#39;s Mario. He&#39;s our son.He was born two and a half years ago,and I had a pretty tough pregnancybecause I had to stay stillin a bed for, like, eight months.But in the end everythingseemed to be under control.So he got the right weight at birth.He got the right Apgar index.So we were pretty reassured by this.But at the end, 10 dayslater after he was born,we discovered that he had a stroke.As you might know,a stroke is a brain injury.A perinatal stroke could be somethingthat can happenduring the nine months of pregnancyor just suddenly after the birth,and in his case, as you can see,the right part of his brain has gone.So the effect that this strokecould have on Mario&#39;s bodycould be the fact that he couldn&#39;tbe able to controlthe left side of his body.Just imagine, if you havea computer and a printerand you want to transmit,to input to print out a document,but the printer doesn&#39;thave the right drives,so the same is for Mario.It&#39;s just like,he would like to move his left sideof his body, but he&#39;s not ableto transmit the right inputto move his left arm and left leg.So life had to change.We needed to change our schedule.We needed to change the impactthat this birth hadon our life.Roberto D&#39;Angelo: As you may imagine,unfortunately, we were not ready.Nobody taught us how to dealwith such kinds of disabilities,and as many questions as possible startedto come to our minds.And that has been really a tough time.Questions, some basics, like, you know,why did this happen to us?And what went wrong?Some more tough, like, really,what will be the impact on Mario&#39;s life?I mean, at the end,will he be able to work?Will he be able to be normal?And, you know, as a parent,especially for the first time,why is he not going to be better than us?And this, indeed, really is tough to say,but a few months later, we realized thatwe were really feeling like a failure.I mean, the only real product of our life,at the end, was a failure.And you know, it was not a failurefor ourselves in itself,but it was a failurethat will impact his full life.Honestly, we went down.I mean we went reallydown, but at the end,we started to look at him,and we said, we have to react.So immediately, as Francescasaid, we changed our life.We started physiotherapy,we started the rehabilitation,and one of the pathsthat we were followingin terms of rehabilitationis the mirror neurons pilot.Basically, we spent monthsdoing this with Mario.You have an object, and we showed himhow to grab the object.Now, the theory of mirrorneurons simply saysthat in your brains, exactlynow, as you watch me doing this,you are activatingexactly the same neuronsas if you do the actions.It looks like this is the leadingedge in terms of rehabilitation.But one day we found that Mariowas not looking at our hand.He was looking at us.We were his mirror.And the problem, as you might feel,is that we were down, we were depressed,we were looking at him as a problem,not as a son, notfrom a positive perspective.And that day reallychanged our perspective.We realized that we had to becomea better mirror for Mario.We restarted from our strengths,and at the same timewe restarted from his strengths.We stopped looking at him as a problem,and we started to look at himas an opportunity to improve.And really, this was the change,and from our side, we said,&quot;What are our strengthsthat we really can bring to Mario?&quot;And we started from our passions.I mean, at the end, my wife and myselfare quite different,but we have many things in common.We love to travel, we love music,we love to be in places like this,and we started to bring Mario with usjust to show to him the bestthings that we can show to him.This short video is from last week.I am not saying —(Applause) —I am not saying it&#39;s a miracle.That&#39;s not the message,because we are justat the beginning of the path.But we want to sharewhat was the key learning,the key learning that Mario drove to us,and it is to considerwhat you have as a giftand not only what you miss,and to consider what youmiss just as an opportunity.And this is the messagethat we want to share with you.This is why we are here.Mario!And this is why —(Applause) —And this is whywe decided to share the bestmirror in the world with him.And we thank you so much, all of you.FF: Thank you. RD: Thank you. Bye.(Applause)FF: Thank you. (Applause)
