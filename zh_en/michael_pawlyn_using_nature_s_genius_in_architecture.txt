zh-cn:我想先讲几个简单的例子这些是蜘蛛吐丝的腺体位在蜘蛛的腹部他们可以分泌出六种不同的丝，编织在一起变成纤维这比任何人类制作出的纤维都要强韧最接近这种特性的要算是芳纶纤维要作出这样的纤维需要极端的温度极端的压力和大量的污染然而蜘蛛却能在一般环境的温度和压力运用死掉苍蝇和水当作原料做出来这种纤维它说明了我们还有东西可学这种甲虫可以侦测到远在80公里外的森林火灾功力这大约是人造火灾探测器所能侦测范围的10,000倍更重要的是，这小昆虫不需要电线连接使用燃料的发电站
en:I&#39;d like to start with a couple of quick examples.These are spinneret glandson the abdomen of a spider.They produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,tougher than any fiber humans have ever made.The nearest we&#39;ve come is with aramid fiber.And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,extremes of pressure and loads of pollution.And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressurewith raw materials of dead flies and water.It does suggest we&#39;ve still got a bit to learn.This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away.That&#39;s roughly 10,000 times the rangeof man-made fire detectors.And what&#39;s more, this guy doesn&#39;t need a wireconnected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.

zh-cn:这两个例子说明了生物模拟是值得学习的如果我们能学会大自然的方式我们可以达到10倍，100倍甚至是1,000倍的节约资源和能源如果我们要有所进步达到永续发​​展我认为有三个非常大的变化是我们需要的第一，提高基本资源使​​用效率第二，把线性的，浪费的，污染的资源使用方式转变成一个封闭的循环模式第三，从矿物燃料经济转变成太阳能经济而对于这三点，我认为生物模拟提供很多的解决方法是我们需要的
en:So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver.If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does,we could achieve factor 10, factor 100,maybe even factor 1,000 savingsin resource and energy use.And if we&#39;re to make progress with the sustainability revolution,I believe there are three really big changeswe need to bring about.Firstly, radical increases in resource efficiency.Secondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful,polluting way of using resourcesto a closed-loop model.And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economyto a solar economy.And for all three of these, I believe,biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we&#39;re going to need.

zh-cn:你可以看一下大自然把它当作是样本所有的东西都来自于3.8亿年的研究和发展的累积基于这样程度的投资，我们也应该使用它所以我要谈谈一些探索这些想法的项目让我们从迅速提高基本资源使​​用效率说起当我们开始执行伊甸园计划时我们必须盖一座非常大的温室在一个不仅不规则而且不断变化的地方，因为这个地方仍在开采这是一个很大的挑战不过它实际上是运用生物学的例子这提供了很多线索例如这参考肥皂泡泡的样子，规划出建筑物的外观不管最后地面高度多高都能做到研究花粉和放射虫类和碳分子帮助我们做出最有效的结构设计运用六边形和五边形
en:You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products,and all of those have benefitedfrom a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.So I&#39;m going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas.And let&#39;s start with radical increasesin resource efficiency.When we were working on the Eden Project,we had to create a very large greenhousein a site that was not only irregular,but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried.It was a hell of a challenge,and it was actually examples from biologythat provided a lot of the clues.So for instance,it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building formthat would work regardless of the final ground levels.Studying pollen grainsand radiolaria and carbon moleculeshelped us devise the most efficient structural solutionusing hexagons and pentagons.

zh-cn:下一步是我们想要把六边形做到最大要做到这点我们必须用可替代玻璃的材质不过这材质能够用的单位面积也相当受限在自然界中非常多的例子都能有效用在结构设计上，像是加压膜技术因此我们开始探索ETFE这种材料这是一种高强度聚合物而我们把它做成三层把它周围边缘焊接起来，然后充气这东西最了不起的地方是它的每一个单位可以大约是玻璃的七倍大重量却只有双层玻璃的百分之一所以这算是100倍的节约资源我们也发现到这带动起良性循环新发现又会带来另一个新发现在这样大又轻的支撑下我们也能减少钢材的使用少一点钢材，阳光就能多一点进来换句话说，在冬天我们不用储备太多的热能加上在建筑上层的整体重量也减少所以地基的建材也能节省许多在这项计画完成的时候，我们发现上层建筑的重量实际上低于建筑物内空气的重量
en:The next move was that we wantedto try and maximize the size of those hexagons.And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass,which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes.And in nature there are lots of examplesof very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.So we started exploring this material called ETFE.It&#39;s a high-strength polymer.And what you do is you put it together in three layers,you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.And the great thing about this stuffis you can make it in unitsof roughly seven times the size of glass,and it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing.So that was a factor-100 saving.And what we found is that we got into a positive cyclein which one breakthrough facilitated another.So with such large, lightweight pillows,we had much less steel.With less steel we were getting more sunlight in,which meant we didn&#39;t have to put as much extra heat in winter.And with less overall weight in the superstructure,there were big savings in the foundations.And at the end of the project we worked outthat the weight of that superstructurewas actually less than the weight of the air inside the building.

zh-cn:我认为伊甸园计划是个相当好的例子说明从生物学学到的想法可以做到提高基本资源使​​用效率在提供相同的功能达到事半功倍的效果实际上大自然中有非常多这样的例子我们可以找到类似的解决方法例如我们能盖出高效能的屋顶结构参考亚马逊巨头睡莲的样子整个建筑灵感来自鲍鱼壳超轻量桥梁设计灵感来自于植物细胞这个既美丽又有效率的世界值得探索运用大自然当作设计的工具
en:So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good exampleof how ideas from biologycan lead to radical increases in resource efficiency —delivering the same function,but with a fraction of the resource input.And actually there are loads of examples in naturethat you could turn to for similar solutions.So for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structuresbased on giant Amazon water lilies,whole buildings inspired by abalone shells,super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells.There&#39;s a world of beauty and efficiency to explore hereusing nature as a design tool.

zh-cn:现在我要说明的是如何从线性转变成封闭式循环我们通常使用资源的方式是开采资源把资源做成生命周期很短的产品，然后用完即丢但大自然的法则不是这样的在生态系统里每一种生物的废弃物会转变成另一种生物的营养来源还有其他几个项目的例子是刻意模仿生态系统其中一项我最喜欢的是&quot;从纸板到鱼子酱&quot;项目由格雷汉姆 怀尔斯所做的在他们那个地区有非常多商店和餐厅造成许多食物、纸板和塑胶的废弃物这些废弃物最后都会被扔到垃圾场但现在他们比较聪明会另外处理废纸板我利用这个动画跟你们解释
en:So now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea.The way we tend to use resourcesis we extract them,we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them.Nature works very differently.In ecosystems, the waste from one organismbecomes the nutrient for something else in that system.And there are some examples of projectsthat have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems.And one of my favoritesis called the Cardboard to Caviar Projectby Graham Wiles.And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurantsthat were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste.It was ending up in landfills.Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste.And I&#39;m just going to talk through this animation.

zh-cn:他们负责从餐厅回收这些纸板然后把纸板碾碎卖给了马术中心用作马匹的垫草等到这些垫草脏了，他们再负责去回收接着把这些脏的垫草用来培育蠕虫这样可以繁殖出许多的蠕虫，这些蠕虫就拿来喂食西伯利亚鲟鱼鲟鱼生产出鱼子酱，鱼子酱再卖回去给餐厅这样的过程就是从线性转变成一个封闭式的循环每一个过程都创造出更多的价值Graham Wiles不断加入更多的元素到这个循环让废弃物在这个计划中创造出价值就像是自然生态一样长期下来能增加多样性和适应性这是就是这个项目的真正目的也就是创造出更多的可能性而且不断地增加价值我知道这是一个奇特的例子但我认为这是影响非常有效因为这实际上可以让我们把大问题变成大机会
en:So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.They then shredded the cardboardand sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.They put it into worm recomposting systems,which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon,which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants.So it transformed a linear processinto a closed-loop model,and it created more value in the process.Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this,turning waste streams into schemes that create value.And just as natural systemstend to increase in diversity and resilience over time,there&#39;s a real sense with this projectthat the number of possibilitiesjust continue increasing.And I know it&#39;s a quirky example,but I think the implications of this are quite radical,because it suggests that we could actuallytransform a big problem — waste — into a massive opportunity.

zh-cn:特别在某些城市要处理垃圾问题就能运用这样的概念这也是我接下来要谈的另一个项目莫比乌斯(Mobius)项目我们试图引进许多活动集合在同一个建筑物里完成所以每一种废弃物都能变成原料我要讲的内容包括首先，我们在温室里有一间餐厅这有点像在阿姆斯特丹的De Kas温室餐厅然后我们在里面设了一座无氧消化器能处理当地所有可生物分解的废弃物再转变成温室的热能和电力回馈到输电网我们有污水处理系统把废水变成干净的水从固体产生能量只利用一些植物和微生物我们有一个养鱼池，用厨房的厨余当作饲料还有堆肥里的蠕虫拿这些拿来喂鱼，鱼再供应给餐厅还会有一个咖啡厅，不要的咖啡渣可以做成种植蘑菇的培养土
en:And particularly in cities —we could look at the whole metabolism of cities,and look at those as opportunities.And that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing on the next project I&#39;m going to talk about,the Mobius Project,where we&#39;re trying to bring together a number of activities,all within one building,so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another.And the kind of elements I&#39;m talking aboutare, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse,a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas.Then we would have an anaerobic digester,which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area,turn that into heat for the greenhouseand electricity to feed back into the grid.We&#39;d have a water treatment systemtreating wastewater, turning that into fresh waterand generating energy from the solidsusing just plants and micro-organisms.We&#39;d have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchenand worms from the compostand supplying fish back to the restaurant.And we&#39;d also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from thatcould be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms.

zh-cn:我们把这些想法结合在一起成为一个食物、能源、水和废弃物的循环这全都发生在同一栋建筑物里为了好玩，我们提出把它建在伦敦市中心的一个环状交叉路因为这个环状交叉路口那时算是政府的眼中钉你们有些人可能认得这个地方运用一点点的规划我们可以把一个以交通为主的空间转变成可以提供给民众的开放空间让人与食物重新有交集让废弃物可以在封闭式循环中得到不同的处置
en:So you can see that we&#39;re bringing togethercycles of food, energy and water and wasteall within one building.And just for fun, we&#39;ve proposed this for a roundabout in central London,which at the moment is a complete eyesore.Some of you may recognize this.And with just a little bit of planning,we could transform a space dominated by trafficinto one that provides open space for people,reconnects people with foodand transforms waste into closed loop opportunities.

zh-cn:我要谈的最后一个项目是撒哈拉造林工程工程，这是我们现阶段正在努力做的这可能对在座的某些人来说听到这消息有点惊讶，因为这一大片地方目前是沙漠但事实上这地方在不久之前其实有座森林例如当凯撒抵达北非的时候在北非有一大片区域被雪松和柏树森林给覆盖在地球开始繁衍出生命的时候土地都被占据被植物给占据才帮助创造出我们现在享受的良好气候反过来也是如此我们失去越多土地上的植被越可能加剧气候变迁导致进一步的沙漠化这个动画显示了数年来的光合作用的活动我们可以看到这些沙漠的范围他们变化很大这引发了一个问题我们是否能干预沙漠的界线去限制或是让沙漠化的土地回复原本的样子
en:So the final project I want to talk aboutis the Sahara Forest Project, which we&#39;re working on at the moment.It may come as a surprise to some of youto hear that quite large areas of what are currently desertwere actually forested a fairly short time ago.So for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa,huge areas of North Africawere covered in cedar and cypress forests.And during the evolution of life on the Earth,it was the colonizationof the land by plantsthat helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy.The converse is also true.The more vegetation we lose,the more that&#39;s likely to exacerbate climate changeand lead to further desertification.And this animation,this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years,and what you can see is that the boundaries of those desertsshift quite a lot,and that raises the questionof whether we can intervene at the boundary conditionsto halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.

zh-cn:你看一些生物可以适应在沙漠生活在适应缺水问题时也有一些令人惊讶的例子这是纳米比亚的沐雾甲虫它自己演化出可以在沙漠收集淡水的方法它的方式是它在夜间出来活动爬到沙丘上头因为他的粗糙黑色外壳能够在夜晚散发热能又能比其周围环境低温因此，当海上吹起了潮湿的微风甲虫的壳就能让水滴凝结在上面在日出前，它把身体抬高，水就能流进嘴里喝一口水，然后躲起来好好休息的一天如果要说，这是大自然的智慧更进一步看如果仔细观察甲虫的外壳外壳上有许多小的突起物而那些突起物具有亲水性，能吸引水在每个突起物间有像蜡一样的沟槽可以排水这个的作用是水滴在这些突起物上形成时水分会紧密而且呈现水珠状所以这比在甲壳虫的整个甲壳上有一薄薄一层水要更具流动性因此即使当空气中只有少量的水分它仍然能够非常有效的获取水分让水流到口里这是一个非常惊人的适应有限资源环境的事例这和我们息息相关我们要面对相似的挑战在未来几年，或几十年
en:And if you look at some of the organismsthat have evolved to live in deserts,there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle,and it&#39;s evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.The way it does this is it comes out at night,crawls to the top of a sand dune,and because it&#39;s got a matte black shell,is able to radiate heat out to the night skyand become slightly cooler than its surroundings.So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea,you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle&#39;s shell.Just before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth,has a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day.And the ingenuity, if you could call it that,goes even further.Because if you look closely at the beetle&#39;s shell,there are lots of little bumps on that shell.And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water.Between them there&#39;s a waxy finish which repels water.And the effect of this is thatas the droplets start to form on the bumps,they stay in tight, spherical beads,which means they&#39;re much more mobilethan they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle&#39;s shell.So even when there&#39;s only a small amount of moisture in the air,it&#39;s able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.So amazing example of an adaptationto a very resource-constrained environment —and in that sense, very relevantto the kind of challenges we&#39;re going to be facingover the next few years, next few decades.

zh-cn:我们正与一位发明了海水温室的人合作这是一种在干旱沿海地区做的温室设计这运作的方式是里头有整座蒸发器架让海水滴流过这里让风吹过收集很多的水分然后在过程中冷却所以里面是凉爽和潮湿的适合不太需要水的植物生长在温室后方能凝结大量的湿气转变为淡水这个过程实际上是和甲虫是相同的而他们盖的第一座海水温室能生产很多的淡水而且多过里头植物所需要的因此他们开始推广到附近的土地结合这一点和湿度升高这两种条件让这个地区有非常大的改变这张照片是在完工日那天拍的一年后看起来像这样它就像一个绿色的墨渍从建筑物扩散出去让贫瘠的土地回复到有生命的样子也就是说这不仅维持了生态平衡更达到恢复生机
en:We&#39;re working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse.This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions,and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills,and you trickle seawater over thatso that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moistureand is cooled in the process.So inside it&#39;s cool and humid,which means the plants need less water to grow.And then at the back of the greenhouse,it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwaterin a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was builtwas it was producing slightly more freshwaterthan it needed for the plants inside.So they just started spreading this on the land around,and the combination of that and the elevated humidityhad quite a dramatic effect on the local area.This photograph was taken on completion day,and just one year later, it looked like that.So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the buildingturning barren land back into biologically productive land —and in that sense, going beyond sustainable designto achieve restorative design.

zh-cn:因此我们希望可以扩大应用生物模拟的想法把效益最大化当我们想到大自然我们大部分想到的是竞争但实际上在成熟的生态系统中你能发现很多例子都存在共生关系所以重要的生物模拟的原则是想办法把不同的技术结合做到集体共生我们看中的技术是能和海水温室的概念合作的太阳能源应用技术它使用能追踪太阳能的镜子集中太阳的热能变成电力我想让你们对太阳能源应用技术多一点了解想想看如果我们每年使用的电有10,000倍来自太阳能比较来自其他的发电方式10,000倍如果这样我们的能源问题就不棘手问题在我们的创造力我现在要说的综效是这两种技术在高温阳光充足的地方都能作用太阳能源应用技术需要去除矿物质的水而海水温室能生产这样的水太阳能源应用技术则产生大量的热能我们可以用来蒸发大量的海水提高回收效益然后在镜子下的遮阴处可以增种各种作物能避免直接的日照这是这个项目的宏图我们会在迎风处建造一大片的温室还有太阳能发电厂以固定的间距盖在这条路上
en:So we were keen to scale this upand apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits.And when you think about nature,often you think about it as being all about competition.But actually in mature ecosystems,you&#39;re just as likely to find examplesof symbiotic relationships.So an important biomimicry principleis to find ways of bringing technologies togetherin symbiotic clusters.And the technology that we settled onas an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouseis concentrated solar power,which uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun&#39;s heatto create electricity.And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP,consider that we receive10,000 times as much energy from the sun every yearas we use in energy from all forms —10,000 times.So our energy problems are not intractable.It&#39;s a challenge to our ingenuity.And the kind of synergies I&#39;m talking aboutare, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts.CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater.That&#39;s exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.CSP produces a lot of waste heat.We&#39;ll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawaterand enhance the restorative benefits.And finally, in the shade under the mirrors,it&#39;s possible to grow all sorts of cropsthat would not grow in direct sunlight.So this is how this scheme would look.The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind.We&#39;d have concentrated solar power plantsat intervals along the way.

zh-cn:在座某些人可能想知道我们会如何处理那些盐分在生物模拟的概念下，如果你有一项还未被使用的资源你不会想&quot;我该怎么把这东西丢掉？&quot;你反而会想&quot;我该加什么东西进来创造出更多的价值？&quot;事实证明不同的物质在不同的阶段会变成结晶开始蒸馏海水的时候，第一样被结晶出来的是碳酸钙碳酸钙会凝聚在蒸发器上就会像左边的图片那样逐渐被碳酸钙给覆盖经过一段时间，我们可以把这些取下来做成轻量的砖块如果你问那碳是哪里来的？那是从大气中来，落到海里然后凝结在这些建材里
en:Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts.And with biomimicry, if you&#39;ve got an underutilized resource,you don&#39;t think, &quot;How am I going to dispose of this?&quot;You think, &quot;What can I add to the system to create more value?&quot;And it turns outthat different things crystallize out at different stages.When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize outis calcium carbonate.And that builds up on the evaporators —and that&#39;s what that image on the left is —gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.So after a while, we could take that out,use it as a lightweight building block.And if you think about the carbon in that,that would have come out of the atmosphere, into the seaand then locked away in a building product.

en:The next thing is sodium chloride.You can also compress that into a building block,as they did here.This is a hotel in Bolivia.And then after that, there are all sortsof compounds and elements that we can extract,like phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them.And there&#39;s just about every element of the periodic tablein seawater.So it should be possible to extract valuable elementslike lithium for high-performance batteries.And in parts of the Arabian Gulf,the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadilydue to the discharge of waste brinefrom desalination plants.And it&#39;s pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.We could evaporate itto enhance the restorative benefitsand capture the salts,transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.Really the Sahara Forest Project is a modelfor how we could create zero-carbon food,abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planetas well as reversing desertification in certain areas.

en:So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning:radical increases in resource efficiency,closing loops and a solar economy.They&#39;re not just possible; they&#39;re critical.And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problemswill provide a lot of the solutions.But perhaps more than anything, what this thinking providesis a really positive way of talking about sustainable design.Far too much of the talk about the environmentuses very negative language.But here it&#39;s about synergies and abundance and optimizing.And this is an important point.
