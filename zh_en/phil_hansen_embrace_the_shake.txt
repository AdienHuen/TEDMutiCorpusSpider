zh-cn:当我就读艺术学院时手开始出现颤抖症状这是我能画出最直的线现在看来其实这对某些事来说还挺好的例如摇匀罐中的颜料，或甩干拍立得相片但当时的感觉确实像世界末日这摧毁了我成为艺术家的梦想
en:So, when I was in art school,I developed a shake in my hand,and this was the straightest line I could draw.Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things,like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid,but at the time this was really doomsday.This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist.

zh-cn:颤抖症状事实上来自于我专研点画的结果经年累月地描绘极小的点最后这些点从完美的圆形变成类似蝌蚪状，因为颤抖的缘故为了改善这一点，我将笔握得更紧却使颤抖症状地更加厉害因此我只能将笔握得更紧这成了恶性循环最后导致剧痛和关节问题我几乎握不住任何东西就在努力追寻从事艺术的毕生梦想后我离开艺术学院，同时与艺术分道扬镳
en:The shake developed out of, really,a single-minded pursuit of pointillism,just years of making tiny, tiny dots.And eventually these dots went from being perfectly roundto looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake.So to compensate, I&#39;d hold the pen tighter,and this progressively made the shake worse,so I&#39;d hold the pen tighter still.And this became a vicious cycle that ended upcausing so much pain and joint issues,I had trouble holding anything.And after spending all my life wanting to do art,I left art school, and then I left art completely.

zh-cn:但几年后，我对艺术依然无法忘怀我决定求助神经科医生，诊治颤抖症状却发现我的神经已永久受损事实上，医生看了一眼我画的扭曲线条开口说，「你何不试着与颤抖共处呢？」
en:But after a few years, I just couldn&#39;t stay away from art,and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shakeand discovered I had permanent nerve damage.And he actually took one look at my squiggly line,and said, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you just embrace the shake?&quot;
时间： 1:19
zh-cn:因此我依言照办，回家后，我拿起笔来任由我的手不停颤抖我创作出类似这样的涂鸦即使这并非我理想中的艺术作品，感觉却很棒即使这并非我理想中的艺术作品，感觉却很棒更重要的是，一旦我设法与颤抖共处我发现我依然能创作艺术我只需要寻找不同的方式创作我想要的艺术
en:So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil,and I just started letting my hand shake and shake.I was making all these scribble pictures.And even though it wasn&#39;t the kind of artthat I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great.And more importantly, once I embraced the shake,I realized I could still make art.I just had to find a different approachto making the art that I wanted.

zh-cn:现在，我依然喜爱点画的片段感看着这些小点聚集成一幅完整的图画看着这些小点聚集成一幅完整的图画因此我开始尝试以其他方式分割图像避免因颤抖而影响作品例如用脚沾颜料，在画布上行走或以木条组成二乘四的3D结构用喷灯在表面烙上2D图像我发现，如果使用大型素材从事大型创作手部的问题完全不会造成影响当我跳脱单一艺术创作方式后我找到激发创造力的方法使我的艺术视野完全改观这是我第一次领悟到这个观点处于局限中确实能激发创造力
en:Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism,seeing these little tiny dots come togetherto make this unified whole.So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment imageswhere the shake wouldn&#39;t affect the work,like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas,or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours,creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials,my hand really wouldn&#39;t hurt,and after having gone from a single approach to art,I ended up having an approach to creativitythat completely changed my artistic horizons.This was the first time I&#39;d encountered this ideathat embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity.

zh-cn:当时我即将毕业我十分高兴能找到一份正职终于买得起新的美术工具我有一套十分简陋的工具组我自认能创作出更棒的作品只要拥有我理想中的艺术家必备工具事实上我连普通剪刀也没有我一直使用金属剪代替直到我从办公室偷来一把剪刀我一直使用金属剪代替直到我从办公室偷来一把剪刀
en:At the time, I was finishing up school,and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies.I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt likeI could do so much more with the suppliesI thought an artist was supposed to have.I actually didn&#39;t even have a regular pair of scissors.I was using these metal shears until I stole a pairfrom the office that I worked at.
时间： 2:50
zh-cn:因此我离开学校、找到工作、领到薪水我前往美术用品店疯狂地采购美术用品回家后，我坐下来全心投入工作，努力试着创作某些完全跳脱框架的作品但我坐了好几个小时，却毫无灵感同样情形日复一日地上演我瞬间陷入创作低潮很长一段时间，我处于黑暗中，无法创作这完全没道理，因为我终于能致力于艺术创作，却丝毫没有创作灵感
en:So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck,I got myself to the art store,and I just went nuts buying supplies.And then when I got home, I sat downand I set myself to task to really try to create somethingjust completely outside of the box.But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.The same thing the next day, and then the next,quickly slipping into a creative slump.And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create.And it didn&#39;t make any sense, because I was finally ableto support my art, and yet I was creatively blank.
时间： 3:27
zh-cn:但当我在黑暗中摸索时我意识到，事实上我已被之前不曾拥有的众多选择麻痹我意识到，事实上我已被之前不曾拥有的众多选择麻痹此时我想起那双颤抖的手与颤抖共处于是我领悟到，如果想找回创作力必须不再专注于跳脱框架的念头试着回到框架中
en:But as I searched around in the darkness,I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choicesthat I never had before.And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands.Embrace the shake.And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back,I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the boxand get back into it.

zh-cn:我思索难道追寻极限使人变得更有创造力吗？我思索难道追寻极限使人变得更有创造力吗？如果我只能用价值一美元的素材创作呢？当时我花了许多夜晚－好吧，我想我现在还是经常在星巴克度过夜晚时光－我知道可以跟店员多要一个纸杯因此我决定要 50 个令人讶异地，他们二话不说地给了我藉由一些我原本就有的铅笔仅花了 80 美分，我就完成这项作品那一刻我恍然大悟我们必须先处于限制中才能超越限制
en:I wondered, could you become more creative, then,by looking for limitations?What if I could only create with a dollar&#39;s worth of supplies?At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in —well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks —but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one,so I decided to ask for 50.Surprisingly, they just handed them right over,and then with some pencils I already had,I made this project for only 80 cents.It really became a moment of clarification for methat we need to first be limitedin order to become limitless.
时间： 4:27
zh-cn:我把这个局限于框架中的想法运用到画布上，我思索，如果无法在画布上作画，只能在自己胸前作画呢？于是我画了 30 张图，一次一层彼此相叠每幅画都代表某个影响我人生的事件或者，如果无法用笔刷作画只能用手劈呢？ （笑声）因此我将双手沾上颜料直接劈向画布事实上我劈得太用力，造成小指关节瘀青好几个星期，我的小指只能直挺挺地竖着
en:I took this approach of thinking inside the boxto my canvas, and wondered what if, instead ofpainting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest?So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time,one on top of another,with each picture representing an influence in my life.Or what if, instead of painting with a brush,I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter)So I&#39;d dip my hands in paint,and I just attacked the canvas,and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkieand it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks.

zh-cn:（笑声）（掌声）
en:(Laughter) (Applause)
时间： 5:00
zh-cn:或者，如果无法靠自己创作必须仰赖他人完成创作内容呢？因此整整六天，我在网络摄像头前过日子我睡地板、吃外卖食物我请别人打电话给我，和我分享故事关于人生中的转折点他们的故事成了艺术创作我把这些故事写在旋转画布上
en:Or, what if instead of relying on myself,I had to rely on other peopleto create the content for the art?So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.I slept on the floor and I ate takeout,and I asked people to call me and share a story with meabout a life-changing moment.Their stories became the artas I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.
时间： 5:25
zh-cn:（掌声）或者，如果创作的目的并非展示而是销毁呢？这就像最终极限成为一位没有作品的艺术家这个毁灭性概念转变成长达一年的计划我称之为“告别艺术”每件作品完成后都必须销毁创作“告别艺术”之初，我将焦点放在强制性毁灭，例如这幅Jimi Hendrix图像由七千多根火柴棒组成（笑声）接着我采用自然销毁方式进行创作我寻找暂时性素材例如口中吐出的食物（笑声）涂鸦粉笔甚至冷冻酒
en:(Applause)Or what if instead of making art to display,I had to destroy it?This seemed like the ultimate limitation,being an artist without art.This destruction idea turned into a yearlong projectthat I called Goodbye Art,where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation.In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused onforced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix,made with over 7,000 matches.(Laughter)Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally.I looked for temporary materials,like spitting out food —(Laughter) —sidewalk chalkand even frozen wine.
时间： 6:17
zh-cn:最后一系列的毁灭性创作是尝试创造一些不曾真正存在的画面因此我将蜡烛排在桌上将它点燃，然后吹熄用同一批蜡烛一再重复这个过程然后将拍摄的视频组成一幅大型图像因此最终图像从未完整存在它在诞生前即遭受毁灭的命运
en:The last iteration of destructionwas to try to produce something that didn&#39;t actually exist in the first place.So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out,then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles,then assembled the videos into the larger image.So the end image was never visible as a physical whole.It was destroyed before it ever existed.
时间： 6:43
zh-cn:从事“告别艺术系列”期间我创作了 23 件不同作品不曾留下任何可展示的实体作品我原本认为的最终限制事实上成了最终解放每一次的创作过程中毁灭阶段都使我重新归零我感到宛如新生随时能开始进行下一个计划这并非一夕可成之事有时我的计划一开始就遇上阻碍更糟的是，花了许多时间后成果却难以见人但既然已投入创作过程，我坚持到底
en:In the course of this Goodbye Art series,I created 23 different pieceswith nothing left to physically display.What I thought would be the ultimate limitationactually turned out to be the ultimate liberation,as each time I created,the destruction brought me back to a neutral placewhere I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project.It did not happen overnight.There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground,or, even worse, after spending tons of time on themthe end image was kind of embarrassing.But having committed to the process, I continued on,
时间： 7:18
zh-cn:最后成果往往出人意料摧毁每一件作品的过程中我学会了放下放下结果、放下失败放下不完美得到的回报是，我找到持续不断的艺术创作过程不因结果受限我发现自己处于持续创作状态只想着下一个创作计划灵感如泉涌般不断浮现
en:and something really surprising came out of this.As I destroyed each project,I was learning to let go,let go of outcomes, let go of failures,and let go of imperfections.And in return, I found a process of creating artthat&#39;s perpetual and unencumbered by results.I found myself in a state of constant creation,thinking only of what&#39;s nextand coming up with more ideas than ever.
时间： 7:45
zh-cn:当我回想远离艺术的三年时光远离我的梦想，只是如行尸走肉般度日不曾试着找出不同方法，继续这个梦想我只是离开、放弃如果我不曾尝试与颤抖共处呢？因为对我来说，与颤抖共处不仅关乎艺术或拥有创作技巧事实上这关乎人生，及拥有生活技能因为最终，大部分我们所做的事都发生在这里局限于框架中和有限的资源下学习在自我极限中发挥创造力是改变自我的最佳方式集合众人的力量，将可改变世界
en:When I think back to my three years away from art,away from my dream, just going through the motions,instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream,I just quit, I gave up.And what if I didn&#39;t embrace the shake?Because embracing the shake for mewasn&#39;t just about art and having art skills.It turned out to be about life, and having life skills.Because ultimately, most of what we dotakes place here, inside the box, with limited resources.Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitationsis the best hope we have to transform ourselvesand, collectively, transform our world.
时间： 8:30
zh-cn:将局限视为创意来源的想法改变了我的人生历程现在，当我遇上瓶颈或发现自己陷入创作低潮有时我依然得与低潮抗争但我不曾逃避这个过程试着提醒自己其中的可能性例如用上百只活生生的虫创作一幅图像用图钉替香蕉纹身或用汉堡的油脂作画
en:Looking at limitations as a source of creativitychanged the course of my life.Now, when I run into a barrieror I find myself creatively stumped,I sometimes still struggle,but I continue to show up for the processand try to remind myself of the possibilities,like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image,using a pushpin to tattoo a banana,or painting a picture with hamburger grease.
时间： 9:04
zh-cn:（笑声）
en:(Laughter)
时间： 9:06
zh-cn:我最近努力的方向是试着将我学到的创作诀窍转变成可让他人复制的技巧
en:One of my most recent endeavorsis to try to translate the habits of creativity that I&#39;ve learnedinto something others can replicate.
时间： 9:14
zh-cn:局限或许是最不可能驾驭创造力的方式，但或许是局限或许是最不可能驾驭创造力的方式，但或许是使我们跳脱框架的最佳方法重新进行规划，挑战既有规范除了勉励彼此活在当下也许我们可以时时提醒自己拥抱局限
en:Limitations may be the most unlikely of placesto harness creativity, but perhapsone of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts,rethink categories and challenge accepted norms.And instead of telling each other to seize the day,maybe we can remind ourselves every dayto seize the limitation.
