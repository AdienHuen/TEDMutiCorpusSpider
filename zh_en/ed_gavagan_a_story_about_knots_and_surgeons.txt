zh-cn:我们每天早上醒来着装打扮，穿上鞋走向外面的世界盘算着回到家来，脱下衣服上床睡觉然后醒来，再重复这一切而这种对生活的期待，这种节奏给了我们一个框架来管理我们自己和自己的生活让我们能够精确预测有多少人像我一样生活在纽约大家忙忙碌碌在同一时间，相距不远就好像从生活的那副牌中多发给你一手牌并列事件不会发生你从不认为它们可能发生而你也从未想过你会成为那个走在街上只是因为选择了某一边走人生就全然改变
en:You know, we wake up in the morning,you get dressed, put on your shoes,you head out into the world.You plan on coming back, getting undressed,going to bed,waking up, doing it again,and that anticipation, that rhythm,helps give us a structureto how we organize ourselves and our lives,and gives it a measure of predictability.Living in New York City, as I do,it&#39;s almost as if, with so many people doing so many thingsat the same time in such close quarters,it&#39;s almost like life is dealing you extra handsout of that deck.You&#39;re never, there&#39;s just, juxtapositions are possiblethat just aren&#39;t, you don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to happen.And you never think you&#39;re going to be the guywho&#39;s walking down the streetand, because you choose to go down one side or the other,the rest of your life is changed forever.

zh-cn:一天晚上，我坐上了上城区的区间列车我试着提高了点警觉当我在地铁里的时候可不是那种沉浸在自己世界里的人，只顾听耳机或者看书我上了车，环顾四周注意到一对情侣两人都是大学生模样一个男生和一个女生，并排坐在一起女生把一条腿架在男生的膝盖上他们在摆弄一个小玩意不停地打结而且只用一只手迅速地换用左手和右手女生做完又拿给男生做这是我从没见过的景象他们就像在变魔术一样
en:And one night, I&#39;m riding the uptown local train.I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilantwhen I get on the subway.I&#39;m not one of the people zoning out with headphonesor a book.And I get on the car, and I look, and Inotice this couple,college-aged, student-looking kids,a guy and a girl, and they&#39;re sitting next to each other,and she&#39;s got her leg draped over his knee,and they&#39;re doing — they have this little contraption,and they&#39;re tying these knots,and they&#39;re doing it with one hand,they&#39;re doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly,and then she&#39;ll hand the thing to him and he&#39;ll do it.I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.It&#39;s almost like they&#39;re practicing magic tricks.

zh-cn:在之后的一站，一个男人上了车他打扮的像个访问教授拿着一个塞得鼓鼓的皮包一个长方形的文件夹，还有一个笔记本电脑包穿着肘部有两块皮补丁的那种粗花呢外套（笑声）看到他们一眨眼的功夫，他已经单膝跪立在他们面前，然后说道“你们知道吗，听我说，你们可以这么做。看着“请看，如果你这样做……” 他从他们手中拿过线马上开始打结做的明显比那两个学生更好，原来这对情侣是医学院的学生正赶去听一个关于最新缝合技术的演讲而那个男人正是那位讲者（笑声）
en:And at the next stop, a guy gets on the car,and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him.He&#39;s got the overstuffed leather satcheland the rectangular file case and a laptop bagand the tweed jacket with the leather patches,and — (Laughter) —he looks at them, and thenin a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them,and he starts to say,&quot;You know, listen, here&#39;s how you can do it. Look,if you do this — &quot; and he takes the laces out of their hand,and instantly, he starts tying these knots,and even better than they were doing it, remarkably.And it turns out they are medical studentson their way to a lecture about the latestsuturing techniques, and he&#39;s the guy giving the lecture.(Laughter)

zh-cn:他告诉他们“不，这里非常重要。你们得知道在打结的时候你们要知道什么都有可能发生，很可能会—你要面对五花八门的情况”挡路“的病人器官病人体内很滑还有这一点至关重要：你们要能够不假思索地完成动作无论是左手还是右手即使眼见看不到手指也必须完成所有工序当我听到这席话的那一瞬间我的思绪飞出了车厢，回到了那个夜晚那晚我躺在救护车里刚刚在人行道上被捅了几刀被送到曼哈顿圣文森医院的清创室这其中的原委是从布鲁克林来了一伙帮派分子为了替三个新加入的成员举行入伙仪式他们按惯例要杀个人而我恰巧在那天晚上走在布利克街上他们不由分说就袭击了我幸运的是我曾在圣母大学参加过拳击队所以我本能地抬起手做出防守姿势我右手边的一个家伙拿着一柄25公分长的刀从我手肘下方攻过来刀刃向上插，割断了我的下腔静脉如果你们懂一点解剖就会知道这个伤很要命与此同时，当然，袭击还在进行这时我仍然举着拳头他拔出刀刃来刺我的脖子刀从我领子那里刺进身体 直没刀柄我使出一记右直拳把中间那个家伙打倒左边那家伙仍在攻击我想刺穿我另一边的肺我反击过去，争取到了分秒时间我沿街一直跑直到倒下救护人员在人行道上帮我插管然后通知清创室伤患即将到达
en:So he starts to tell them, and he&#39;s like,&quot;No, this is very important here. You know,when you&#39;re needing these knots,it&#39;s going to be, you know, everything&#39;sgoing to be happening at the same time, it&#39;s going to be —you&#39;re going to have all this information coming at you,there&#39;s going to be organs getting in the way,it&#39;s going to be slippery,andit&#39;s just very important that you be able to do thesebeyond second nature, each hand, left hand, right hand,you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers.&quot;And at that moment, when I heard that,I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a nightwhen I had been getting a ride in an ambulancefrom the sidewalk where I had been stabbedto the trauma room of St. Vincent&#39;s Hospital in Manhattan,and what had happened wasa gang had come in from Brooklyn.As part of an initiation for three of their members,they had to kill somebody,and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Streetthat night,and they jumped on me without a word.One of the very lucky things,when I was at Notre Dame, I was on the boxing team,so I put my hands up right away, instinctively.The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade,and he went in under my elbow,and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava.If you know anything about anatomy,that&#39;s not a good thing to get cut,and everything, of course, on the way up,and then — I still had my hands up —he pulled it out and went for my neck,and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck,and I got one straight right punchand knocked the middle guy out.The other guy was still working on me,collapsing my other lung,and I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute.I ran down the street and collapsed,and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalkand let the trauma room knowthey had an incoming.

zh-cn:大量失血的其中一个副作用是你的视野变得狭窄我记得自己被抬上担架只能看到五分镍币那么大的地方我试着转头我们到达了圣文森医院在走廊里狂奔看着顶灯一盏盏退后都是这类稀奇古怪的记忆不像一般的记忆这些记忆的影像部分以超高分辨率存储而（刺激的）音效部分仿佛出自乔治.卢卡斯之手（笑声）有时候，回忆当时浮现的那些记忆跟一般的记忆完全不同
en:And one of theside effects of having major massive blood lossis you get tunnel vision,so I remember being on the stretcherand having a little nickel-sized cone of vision,and I was moving my head aroundand we got to St. Vincent&#39;s,and we&#39;re racing down this hallway,and I see the lights going,and it&#39;s a peculiar effect of memories like that.They don&#39;t really go to the usual place that memories go.They kind of have this vault where they&#39;re stored in high-def,and George Lucas did all the sound effects. (Laughter)So sometimes, remembering them, it&#39;s like,it&#39;s not like any other kind of memories.

zh-cn:我被送到清创室医护人员在等我，手术灯亮着我好不容易可以正常呼吸了之前因为血流到肺里我很难呼吸而现在血流到担架床上，似乎轻松了些我张口问道“有什么我能效劳的吗？”然后……（笑声）护士笑的有些歇斯底里了，当时我转着脑袋试图看清在场的每一个人奇怪的是，那时候我居然回想起在大学搞募捐的时候为孟加拉洪水的灾民募捐时的情景看到麻醉师帮我把氧气面罩戴上我居然在想“他长得真像孟加拉人”（笑声）我得知这两件事，就觉得这能成（笑声）
en:And I get into the trauma room,and they&#39;re waiting for me, and the lights are there,and I&#39;d been able to breathe a little more now,because the blood has left, had been filling up my lungsand I was having a very hard time breathing,but now it&#39;s kind of gone into the stretcher.And I said, &quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;and — (Laughter) —the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, andI&#39;m turning my head trying to see everybody,and I had this weird memory of being in collegeand raising,raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh,and then I look over and my anesthesiologistis clamping the mask on me, and I think,&quot;He looks Bangladeshi,&quot; — (Laughter) —and I just have those two facts, and I just think,&quot;This could work somehow.&quot; (Laughter)

zh-cn:然后我就昏过去了医生护士彻夜为我动手术为了救活我，用了40单位的血手术中医生取出了我三分之一的肠子我的盲肠，还有一些我不知道名字的器官医生时候告诉我他那晚在手术室做的最后一件事就是取掉了我的阑尾我觉得这很不错终于有点完整的东西了（笑声）第二天早上麻醉过去，我醒了过来医生告诉大家他要呆在病房里他给了我2%的生存机会
en:And then I go out, andthey work on me for the rest of the night,and I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me therewhile they did their work,and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines,my cecum, organs I didn&#39;t know that I had,and he later told me one of the last things he didwhile he was in there was to remove my appendix for me,which I thought was great, you know,just a little tidy thing there at the end. (Laughter)And I came to in the morning.Out of anesthetic, he had let them knowthat he wanted to be there, and he had given meabout a two percent chance of living.

zh-cn:我醒过来时他在身边那天醒来就像是从疼痛的冻湖中破冰而出疼痛笼罩着我全身上下唯一不那么疼的地方是我的脚背医生拿住我的脚弓正用大拇指按摩我的脚背
en:So he was there when I woke up,and it was, waking up was likebreaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain.It was that enveloping,and there was only one spot that didn&#39;t hurtworse than anything I&#39;d ever felt,and it was my instep,and he was holding the arch of my footand rubbing the instep with his thumb.
时间： 8:02
zh-cn:我抬眼看他，他对我说“太好了，你醒了”我尝试回忆昨晚的事我尝试回忆但全身痛不可支他说“我们没有剪掉你的头发。我觉得你能像参孙大力士一样从头发中获得力量你需要你能得到的一切力量（来复原）那时我的头发长及腰间我飙摩托车，未婚开酒吧，那个时代不一样嘛（笑声）
en:And I looked up, and he&#39;s like,&quot;Good to see you,&quot;and I was trying to remember what had happenedand trying to get my head around everything,and the pain was just overwhelming, and he said,&quot;You know, we didn&#39;t cut your hair. I thoughtyou might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson,and you&#39;re going to need all the strength you can get.&quot;And in those days, my hair was down to my waist,I drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried,I owned a bar, so those were different times. (Laughter)

zh-cn:但是我挂着一身生命支持仪器躺了三天所有人都以为受了这么重的伤我会挺不过去三天时间里所有人都在关心我 死或者拉屎（笑声）当我终于能大便了从外科手术的角度上讲，这就算是从鬼门关回来了（笑声）那一天，医生进门来抽走了我的床单他身边跟着三四个朋友他做了这个手势，其他人都看过来发现我身上没有感染他们弯下腰来，戳戳这里，按按那里说道“没有血肿……看看这颜色”，他们径自谈论着我就像一台刚结束大修的车我的医生还说了句“是啊，这是我修的。”（笑声）这可真是……这可太神奇了，他们和我的医生击掌庆祝我的康复（笑声）那时我肚子上还有医用拉链啊，皮肤缝合钉啊这些乱七八糟的东西
en:ButI had three days of life support,and everybody was expecting,due to just the massive amount of what they had had to dothat I wasn&#39;t going to make it,so it was three days ofeverybody was either waiting for me to die or poop,and — (Laughter) —when I finally pooped, then that somehow,surgically speaking, that&#39;s like you crossed some good line,and, um — (Laughter) —on that day, the surgeon came inand whipped the sheet off of me.He had three or four friends with him,and he does that, and they all look,and there was no infection,and they bend over me and they&#39;re poking and prodding,and they&#39;re like, &quot;There&#39;s no hematomas, blah blah,look at the color,&quot; and they&#39;re talking amongst themselvesand I&#39;m, like, this restored automobilethat he&#39;s just going, &quot;Yeah, I did that.&quot; (Laughter)And it was just,it was amazing, because these guys are high-fiving himover how good I turned out, you know? (Laughter)And it&#39;s my zipper, and I&#39;ve still got the staples inand everything.

zh-cn:后来我出院后经常有记忆闪回做噩梦，搞得我十分痛苦我又找到那位医生问他我接下来怎么办作为外科医生，他的大概意思是“小子，我救了你的命。你现在能尽情地做你想做的事。你要适应这一切。这就像我给了你一辆新车，你却在抱怨停车难。别想太多，努力生活吧。你活着，这是最重要的”
en:Andlater on, when I got outand the flashbacks and thenightmares were giving me a hard time,I went back to himand I was sort of asking him,you know, what am I gonna do?And I think, kind of, as a surgeon, he basically said,&quot;Kid, I saved your life.Like, now you can do whatever you want, like,you gotta get on with that.It&#39;s like I gave you a new carand you&#39;re complaining about not finding parking.Like, just, go out, and, you know, do your best.But you&#39;re alive. That&#39;s what it&#39;s about.&quot;

zh-cn:这时我听见“bing-bong”一声，车厢门关上了下一站我就要下车了我看着那对学生心想“我要把衬衫撩起来给他们看看” （笑声）我转而又想，“不行，这可是纽约地铁，这样做会让别人误会的。”（笑声）
en:And then I hear, &quot;Bing-bong,&quot; and the subway doorsare closing, and my stop is next, and I look at these kids,and I go, I think to myself,&quot;I&#39;m going to lift my shirt upand show them,&quot; — (Laughter) —and then I think, &quot;No, this is the New York City subway,that&#39;s going to lead to other things.&quot; (Laughter)

zh-cn:所以我只是在脑子里想想罢了。他们去听讲座我下了车，站在站台上伸出食指抚上我的第一道伤疤从肚脐这儿绕过这儿来到最后一道伤疤是那位医生的杰作我感慨万千遇到那些带刀的街头小无赖的偶然让我遇到了我的外科团队他们的严格训练他们的卓绝医术当然了，必须再加上一点运气逆转了乾坤
en:And so I just think, they got their lecture to go to.I step off, I&#39;m standing on the platform,and I feel my index fingerinthe first scar that I ever got,from my umbilical cord,and then around that, is tracedthe last scar that I gotfrom my surgeon,and I think that, that chance encounterwith those kids on the street with their knivesled meto my surgical team,and their trainingand their skilland, always, a little bit of luckpushed back against chaos.
