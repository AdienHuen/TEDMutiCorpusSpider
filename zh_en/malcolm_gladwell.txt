zh-cn:谢谢来到这里演讲是我的荣幸上一次我在TED的演讲大概是七年前讲的是意大利面调料很多人看了那个视频所有从此就有很多人来问我意大利面调料的问题刚开始的时候这还是件挺美好的事－（笑声）但是这么持续了七年就不那么美好了所以我要再來一次然后把意大利面调料这事能放到脑后去
en:Thank you.It&#39;s a real pleasure to be here.I last did a TED TalkI think about seven years ago or so.I talked about spaghetti sauce.And so many people,I guess, watch those videos.People have beencoming up to me ever sinceto ask me questions about spaghetti sauce,which is a wonderful thingin the short term —(Laughter)but it&#39;s proven to be less than idealover seven years.And so I though I would comeand try and put spaghetti sauce behind me.

zh-cn:今天早上部分的主题是我们创造的东西我讲的故事是关于一个人他创造了他那个时代最宝贵的东西他的名字叫卡尔･诺顿卡尔･诺顿生于1880年瑞士人众所周知瑞士人可以分为两类：那些制造精细昂贵物件的人和那些管理着能买得起那些精细昂贵物件的人的钱的人卡尔･诺顿绝对属于第一阵营他是个工程师就读于苏黎士联邦理工学院他有个名叫列宁的同学这个同学总是把精细昂贵的东西搞坏
en:The theme of this morning&#39;ssession is Things We Make.And so I thought I would tell a storyabout someonewho made one of the most precious objectsof his era.And the man&#39;s name is Carl Norden.Carl Norden was born in 1880.And he was Swiss.And of course, the Swiss can be dividedinto two general categories:those who make small, exquisite,expensive objectsand those who handle the moneyof those who buy small, exquisite,expensive objects.And Carl Norden is veryfirmly in the former camp.He&#39;s an engineer.He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich.In fact, one of his classmatesis a young man named Leninwho would go onto break small, expensive,exquisite objects.

zh-cn:卡尔作为一个瑞士工程师是绝对配得上这个称号的他穿三件套的西装留着很小但是很重要的胡子盛气凌人又自恋有抱负又极度自负而且他每天工作16个小时精通交流电路不过他也觉得晒黑是种道德软弱的表现他喝大量咖啡他最好的作品都是在苏黎世他母亲的厨房里做出来了他手拿一把滑尺可以安静地工作好几个小时♪
en:And he&#39;s a Swiss engineer, Carl.And I mean that in itsfullest sense of the word.He wears three-piece suits;and he has a very, very small,important mustache;and he is domineeringand narcissisticand drivenand has an extraordinary ego;and he works 16-hour days;and he has very strong feelingsabout alternating current;and he feels like a suntanis a sign of moral weakness;and he drinks lots of coffee;and he does his best worksitting in his mother&#39;s kitchenin Zurich for hoursin complete silencewith nothing but a slide rule.

zh-cn:不过卡尔･诺顿在一战期间移民美国在曼哈顿市中心老佛爷大街上开了家店后来他迷上了怎么从飞机上往下扔炸弹这个问题试想一下在有GPS和雷达之前这是个相当难的问题一个复杂的物理问题飞机在几千英尺的高空以每小时几百英里的速度飞行然后要投下一个炸弹命中一个静止物体还得考虑风和云层及其他各种参数很多人在一战以及二战之前想解决此问题但都没能成功当时使用的投弹瞄准器十分粗糙
en:In any case,Carl Norden emigratesto the United Statesjust before the First World Warand sets up shop on Lafayette Streetin downtown Manhattan.And he becomes obsessed with the questionof how to drop bombs from an airplane.Now if you think about it,in the age before GPS and radar,that was obviouslya really difficult problem.It&#39;s a complicated physics problem.You&#39;ve got a plane that&#39;sthousands of feet up in the air,going at hundreds of miles an hour,and you&#39;re trying to dropan object, a bomb,towards some stationary targetin the face of all kindsof winds and cloud coverand all kinds of other impediments.And all sorts of people,moving up to the First World Warand between the wars,tried to solve this problem,and nearly everybody came up short.The bombsights that were availablewere incredibly crude.
时间： 3:10
zh-cn:卡尔･诺顿就是解决这个难题的人他开发出了特别复杂的设备大概有50磅重叫作诺顿15号投弹瞄准器上面有各种各样的杠杆轴承小工具还有计量器他造出了这个复杂的机械能够实现的就是投弹手手持这个瞄准器看准目标置于炸弹的有机玻璃锥范围内然后输入飞机飞行高度速度以及风速还有目标的坐标这样瞄准器就回高速投手何时投放炸弹用诺顿的话来说“在有投弹瞄准器之前炸弹常常是偏离目标一英里以上。”他说有了他的15号诺顿瞄准器他能从两万英尺的高空把炸弹扔到地上一个咸菜桶里
en:But Carl Norden is reallythe one who cracks the code.And he comes up with thisincredibly complicated device.It weighs about 50 lbs.It&#39;s called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.And it has all kinds of leversand ball-bearingsand gadgets and gauges.And he makes this complicated thing.And what he allows people to dois he makes the bombardiertake this particular object,visually sight the target,because they&#39;re in the Plexiglascone of the bomber,and then they plug inthe altitude of the plane,the speed of the plane,the speed of the windand the coordinatesof the target.And the bombsight will tell himwhen to drop the bomb.And as Norden famously says,&quot;Before that bombsight came along,bombs would routinely miss their targetby a mile or more.&quot;But he said, with theMark 15 Norden bombsight,he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrelat 20,000 ft.

zh-cn:美军得知了诺顿投弹瞄准器后他们的兴奋是难以言表的那简直是天降甘霖这支军队刚刚经历的一战数百万的士兵困在战壕里没头绪没进展然后这位弟兄造出了一个设备能让他们从敌人上空飞过的时候以极高的精确度摧毁一切目标
en:Now I cannot tell youhow incredibly excitedthe U.S. military wasby the news of the Norden bombsight.It was like manna from heaven.Here was an armythat had just had experiencein the First World War,where millions of menfought each other in the trenches,getting nowhere, making no progress,and here someone had come up with a devicethat allowed them to fly up in the skieshigh above enemy territoryand destroy whatever they wantedwith pinpoint accuracy.

zh-cn:美军花了十五亿美元那可是1940年的十五亿美元来开发诺顿投弹瞄准器项目这是个什么样的项目曼哈顿计划的总花销是三十亿美元曼哈顿计划的一半花费投在了诺顿瞄准器上而曼哈顿计划无疑是近代史上最著名的军工合作计划军队里的战略家们真以为找到了致命武器能在和纳粹以及日本军的战斗中一显神威
en:And the U.S. militaryspends 1.5 billion dollars —billion dollars in 1940 dollars —developing the Norden bombsight.And to put that in perspective,the total cost of the Manhattan projectwas three billion dollars.Half as much money was spenton this Norden bombsightas was spent on the most famousmilitary-industrial projectof the modern era.And there were people, strategists,within the U.S. militarywho genuinely thoughtthat this single devicewas going to spell the differencebetween defeat and victorywhen it came to thebattle against the Nazisand against the Japanese.
时间： 5:23
zh-cn:诺顿自己也以为这个设备有其道德意义因为他是虔诚的基督徒当他听到人们把此设备归功于他的发明时往往会沮丧因为他觉得只有上帝才能发明食物他只是执行了上帝的意志上帝的意志是什么呢？上帝的意志就是人们在战争中遭受的痛苦越小越好
en:And for Norden as well,this device had incrediblemoral importance,because Norden was a committed Christian.In fact, he would always get upsetwhen people referred to thebombsight as his invention,because in his eyes,only God could invent things.He was simplythe instrument of God&#39;s will.And what was God&#39;s will?Well God&#39;s will was thatthe amount of suffering in any kind of warbe reduced to as smallan amount as possible.
时间： 5:49
zh-cn:诺顿瞄准器的作用是什么？作用就是让炸弹只炸到想炸的目标上去所以在二战前几年美军购买了九万件这样的投弹瞄准器每一个都价值一万四千美元－在1940年这可是大钱他们训练了五万名投手来操作－数月的高强度训练－因为这个设备根本上是模拟计算机操作不易每一个投手都必须盟誓如果被俘不得泄漏关于此设备的一个字因为这么重要的设备的情报绝对不能落入敌人之手
en:And what did the Norden bombsight do?Well it allowed you to do that.It allowed you to bomb only those thingsthat you absolutely neededand wanted to bomb.So in the years leading up tothe Second World War,the U.S. military buys 90,000of these Norden bombsightsat a cost of $14,000 each —again, in 1940 dollars,that&#39;s a lot of money.And they trained 50,000 bombardierson how to use them —long extensive, months-longtraining sessions —because these things areessentially analog computers;they&#39;re not easy to use.And they make every oneof those bombardiers take an oath,to swear that if they&#39;re ever captured,they will not divulge a single detailof this particular device to the enemy,because it&#39;s imperativethe enemy not get their handson this absolutely essentialpiece of technology.

zh-cn:每一架诺顿瞄准器被安放到飞机上时都有一队军队护送它被装在盒子里，上面盖着帆布一个手铐把一名士兵和盒子铐到一起禁止拍照设备里还有一个燃烧弹一旦飞机失事，机器就被毁从而敌军也无法获得情报诺顿的投弹瞄准器被视为圣杯
en:And whenever the Norden bombsightis taken onto a plane,it&#39;s escorted there bya series of armed guards.And it&#39;s carried in a boxwith a canvas shroud over it.And the box is handcuffedto one of the guards.It&#39;s never allowed to be photographed.And there&#39;s a littleincendiary device inside of it,so that, if the plane ever crashes,it will be destroyedand there&#39;s no way the enemycan ever get their hands on it.The Norden bombsightis the Holy Grail.
时间： 7:06
zh-cn:那么二战的实况如何呢？结果，它并没有那个圣杯实战中，诺顿投弹瞄准器确实可以从两万英尺高空把炸弹扔到咸菜桶里但那是在理想条件下而战时是没有理想条件的首先，机器十分难操作不是五万名投手都真的能够操作模拟计算机其次，它总是出故障机器里到处是陀螺仪和滑轮小工具以及轴承在炽热的战场上这些玩意儿常不能正常工作
en:So what happens duringthe Second World War?Well, it turns outit&#39;s not the Holy Grail.In practice, the Norden bombsightcan drop a bomb intoa pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.,but that&#39;s under perfect conditions.And of course, in wartime,conditions aren&#39;t perfect.First of all, it&#39;s really hard to use —really hard to use.And not all of the peoplewho are of those 50,000 menwho are bombardiershave the ability to properlyprogram an analog computer.Secondly, it breaks down a lot.It&#39;s full of all kindsof gyroscopes and pulleysand gadgets and ball-bearings,and they don&#39;t work as wellas they ought toin the heat of battle.
时间： 7:44
zh-cn:第三，诺顿当初计算的时候是在飞机低空低速飞行的假设条件下做的但是战争可不是这样这么做就中枪了飞机往往是高速高空飞行诺顿的投弹瞄准器在这样的条件下表现不佳
en:Thirdly, when Nordenwas making his calculations,he assumed that a plane would be flyingat a relatively slow speedat low altitudes.Well in a real war, you can&#39;t do that;you&#39;ll get shot down.So they started flying themat high altitudes at incredibly high speeds.And the Norden bombsightdoesn&#39;t work as wellunder those conditions.
时间： 8:03
zh-cn:最关键的是使用诺顿瞄准的投手得目视看到目标但是实际上是怎样的呢？天上有云机器要求无云的天空来操作你觉得1940年到1945间中欧到底有多少无云的天气呢？很少
en:But most of all,the Norden bombsightrequired the bombardierto make visual contact with the target.But of course, what happens in real life?There are clouds, right.It needs cloudless skyto be really accurate.Well how many cloudless skiesdo you think therewere above Central Europebetween 1940 and 1945?Not a lot.
时间： 8:27
zh-cn:这样你大概明白了诺顿的瞄准器是有多么不精确1944年有个著名的例子盟军对位于德国洛伊纳的一家化工厂进行轰炸这个工厂占地757公顷在22轮轰炸任务里盟军用诺顿投弹瞄准器在这757公顷的化工厂上扔下去了八万五千枚炸弹你估计有多少实实在在掉在了这占地七百多公顷的化工厂上了呢？只有百分之十而这命中的百分之十里有百分之十六都是哑弹，没爆炸这家化工厂在经历了战争史上最猛烈的轰炸后几个星期内又重新开工了
en:And then to give you a senseof just how inaccuratethe Norden bombsight was,there was a famous case in 1944where the Allies bombeda chemical plant in Leuna, Germany.And the chemical plant comprised757 acres.And over the courseof 22 bombing missions,the Allies dropped 85,000 bombson this 757 acre chemical plant,using the Norden bombsight.Well what percentage of those bombsdo you think actually landedinside the 700-acreperimeter of the plant?10 percent. 10 percent.And of those 10 percent that landed,16 percent didn&#39;t even go off;they were duds.The Leuna chemical plant,after one of the most extensivebombings in the history of the war,was up and running within weeks.

zh-cn:那些为了不让纳粹获得诺顿瞄准器的防范措施又如何呢？结果身为瑞士人的诺顿本人很欣赏德国工程师在三十年代他的手下就有一帮德国工程师其中有个叫赫尔曼･龙的他于1938年把整套的诺顿投弹瞄准器计划全都给了纳粹所以战时纳粹有自己的诺顿投弹瞄准器－当然他们的也不怎么好使
en:And by the way, all those precautionsto keep the Norden bombsightout of the hands of the Nazis?Well it turns outthat Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss,was very enamored of German engineers.So in the 1930s,he hired a whole bunch of them,including a man named Hermann Longwho, in 1938,gave a complete set of the plansfor the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.So they had their own Norden bombsightthroughout the entire war —which also, by the way,didn&#39;t work very well.

zh-cn:那么我们为什么要说诺顿投弹瞄准器呢？因为我们生活的时代到出是象诺顿投弹瞄准器一样的玩意儿我们所处的时代到处是聪明人他们奔走相告发明了改变世界的东西他们发明了解放人们的网站发明了各种各样的东西能把世界变的更美好
en:So why do we talk aboutthe Norden bombsight?Well because we live in an agewhere there are lots and lotsof Norden bombsights.We live in a timewhere there are all kindsof really, really smart peoplerunning around, sayingthat they&#39;ve invented gadgetsthat will forever change our world.They&#39;ve invented websitesthat will allow people to be free.They&#39;ve invented some kind of this thing,or this thing, or this thingthat will make our world forever better.

zh-cn:军队里更是有大量卡尔･诺顿去五角大楼，他们会说“知道吗？我们现在真的能把炸弹从两万英尺的高空扔道一个咸菜桶里。”而且他们说的的确是实话但我们很清初这话的份量到底有几何
en:If you go into the military,you&#39;ll find lots of Carl Nordens as well.If you go to the Pentagon, they will say,&quot;You know what, now we really canput a bomb inside a pickle barrelat 20,000 ft.&quot;And you know what, it&#39;s true;they actually can do that now.But we need to be very clearabout how little that means.

zh-cn:伊拉克战争的开始阶段美军空军派出两支F-5E鹰式战斗机部队飞到伊拉克沙漠里飞机装备着价值五百万美元的相机来察勘整个沙漠地面他们的任务就是找到并摧毁飞毛腿导弹发射器伊拉克人用来打击以色列人的地对空导弹这两支分队的任务就是去摧毁这些飞毛腿导弹发射器他们部分昼夜地巡飞扔下了上千枚炸弹发射了上千枚导弹来拔掉这些发射器
en:In the Iraq War, at the beginningof the first Iraq War,the U.S. military, the air force,sent two squadronsof F-15E Fighter Eaglesto the Iraqi desertequipped with thesefive million dollar camerasthat allowed them to seethe entire desert floor.And their mission wasto find and to destroy —remember the Scud missile launchers,those surface-to-air missilesthat the Iraqis were launchingat the Israelis?The mission of the two squadronswas to get rid of all theScud missile launchers.And so they flew missions day and night,and they dropped thousands of bombs,and they fired thousands of missilesin an attempt to get ridof this particular scourge.
时间：11:14
zh-cn:战后曾有一个听证会这是军队惯例他们问：我们到底成功毁掉了多少发射器？猜猜结果如何？零，一个都没有为什么呢？是他们的设备不够准确？不是，那些设备非常精确他们能从两万五千英尺高空摧毁那些小玩意儿问题是他们不知道这些小玩意儿到底在哪儿炸弹和咸菜桶的问题不在于如何把炸弹扔进去而是怎么才能找到咸菜桶这总是战争中最大的难题
en:And after the war was over,there was an audit done —as the army always does,the air force always does —and they asked the question:how many Scuds did we actually destroy?You know what the answer was?Zero, not a single one.Now why is that?Is it because their weaponsweren&#39;t accurate?Oh no, they were brilliantly accurate.They could have destroyedthis little thing right herefrom 25,000 ft.The issue was they didn&#39;t knowwhere the Scud launchers were.The problem with bombs and pickle barrelsis not getting the bombinside the pickle barrel,it&#39;s knowing how tofind the pickle barrel.That&#39;s always been the harder problemwhen it comes to fighting wars.

zh-cn:再看看阿富汗战争中情局在巴勒斯坦西北部的标志性武器是什么？无人飞机。什么是无人飞机？它其实就是诺顿15号投弹瞄准器的次生产物它的准确性和精度都非常高过去六年中在巴基斯坦的西北地区中情局用几百枚无人机导弹杀掉了两千名疑似巴基斯坦和塔利班激进分子这些无人机的精确度是多少呢？十分惊人无人机的打击力度可以达到大概百分之九十五的精确度也就是百分之九十五的目标命中，对吧？这是战争史上最好的纪录了
en:Or take the battle in Afghanistan.What is the signature weaponof the CIA&#39;s war in Northwest Pakistan?It&#39;s the drone. What is the drone?Well it is the grandsonof the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.It is this weapon of devastatingaccuracy and precision.And over the course of the last six yearsin Northwest Pakistan,the CIA has flown hundredsof drone missiles,and it&#39;s used those dronesto kill 2,000 suspectedPakistani and Taliban militants.Now what is the accuracy of those drones?Well it&#39;s extraordinary.We think we&#39;re now at 95 percent accuracywhen it comes to drone strikes.95 percent of the peoplewe kill need to be killed, right?That is one of the mostextraordinary recordsin the history of modern warfare.
时间：12:44
zh-cn:但关键是什么呢？在使用无人机进行精确打击的同时阿富汗针对美军的袭击包括自杀式袭击和恐怖袭击增加了十倍在我们越来越高效地杀掉敌军时他们也越来越愤怒越来越激动地要杀掉我们我说地不是一个成功案例而是一个反面教材
en:But do you know what the crucial thing is?In that exact same periodthat we&#39;ve been using these droneswith devastating accuracy,the number of attacks, of suicide attacksand terrorist attacks,against American forces in Afghanistanhas increased tenfold.As we have gotten more and more efficientin killing them,they have become angrier and angrierand more and more motivated to kill us.I have not describedto you a success story.I&#39;ve described to youthe opposite of a success story.
时间：13:17
zh-cn:这就是我们有了新发明后地心理膨胀我们认为新发明能解决问题但是问题本身要复杂很多问题不是在于炸弹地精确队如何而是你怎么用它更重要的是你是不是该用它
en:And this is the problemwith our infatuationwith the things we make.We think the thingswe make can solve our problems,but our problems are muchmore complex than that.The issue isn&#39;t the accuracyof the bombs you have,it&#39;s how you use the bombs you have,and more importantly,whether you ought to use bombs at all.

zh-cn:诺顿还有他的投弹瞄准器的故事还有个后记在1945年8月6日一名叫伊诺拉･盖的投弹手从日本上空飞过用诺顿投弹瞄准器在广岛上空投下了一枚原子弹如同其他的诺顿瞄准器一样炸弹偏离的目标八百英尺当然这已经不重要了诺顿投弹瞄准器的最大讽刺也就在此美军空军用15亿的投弹瞄准器扔下来三十亿的炸弹结果根本就不需要瞄准器
en:There&#39;s a postscriptto the Norden storyof Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight.And that is, on August 6, 1945,a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gayflew over Japanand, using a Norden bombsight,dropped a very large thermonuclear deviceon the city of Hiroshima.And as was typicalwith the Norden bombsight,the bomb actuallymissed its target by 800 ft.But of course, it didn&#39;t matter.And that&#39;s the greatest irony of allwhen it comes to the Norden bombsight.the air force&#39;s 1.5 billiondollar bombsightwas used to dropits three billion dollar bomb,which didn&#39;t need a bombsight at all.

zh-cn:同时在纽约没人告诉卡尔･诺顿他的瞄准器用在了广岛轰炸上他是个虔诚的基督徒他以为他的发明能减少在战争中受苦的人们他要知道了一定伤心至极
en:Meanwhile, back in New York,no one told Carl Nordenthat his bombsight was usedover Hiroshima.He was a committed Christian.He thought he had designed somethingthat would reduce the tollof suffering in war.It would have broken his heart.
