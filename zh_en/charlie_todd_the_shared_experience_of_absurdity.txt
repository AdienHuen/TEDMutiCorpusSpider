zh-cn:大约十年前我创立了“随处即兴”当时我刚搬到纽约，对表演和喜剧充满兴趣因为初来乍到，我找不到舞台落脚于是我决定在公共场所创造我的大舞台
en:I started Improv Everywhere about 10 years agowhen I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy.Because I was new to the city, I didn&#39;t have access to a stage,so I decided to create my own in public places.

zh-cn:我们将要看到的第一个活动就是“首届不穿裤子乘地铁”那是在2002年1月这位女士就是女主角她不知道自己被拍摄一个隐蔽摄像头纪录了这一切这是纽约地铁6号线这是这条线路的第一站两个丹麦人上来了他们坐到了隐蔽摄像头的旁边穿着咖啡色外套的就是我当时室外温度大概是零下一度我戴着帽子和围巾她马上就注意到我了（笑声）而你现在可见，我没穿裤子（笑声）现在她注意到我了但是在纽约，地铁里怪人随处可见一个人没有什么稀奇的她继续看书，巧得很书名叫《强奸》（笑声）她注意到奇怪的事但很快恢复常态
en:So the first project we&#39;re going to take a look atis the very first No Pants Subway Ride.Now this took place in January of 2002.And this woman is the star of the video.She doesn&#39;t know she&#39;s being filmed.She&#39;s being filmed with a hidden camera.This is on the 6 train in New York City.And this is the first stop along the line.These are two Danish guyswho come out and sit down next to the hidden camera.And that&#39;s me right there in a brown coat.It&#39;s about 30 degrees outside.I&#39;m wearing a hat. I&#39;m wearing a scarf.And the girl&#39;s going to notice me right here.(Laughter)And as you&#39;ll see now, I&#39;m not wearing pants.(Laughter)So at this point —at this point she&#39;s noticed me,but in New York there&#39;s weirdos on any given train car.One person&#39;s not that unusual.She goes back to reading her book, which is unfortunately titled &quot;Rape.&quot;(Laughter)So she&#39;s noticed the unusual thing,but she&#39;s gone back to her normal life.

zh-cn:与此同时，我的6个朋友再接下来的6个站只穿着内裤等着他们将一个接一个进来我们装作相互不认识我们都装作 只是碰巧在这寒冬腊月都忘了穿裤子（笑声）现在她把书合上（笑声）决定看看到底是怎么一回事
en:Now in the meantime, I have six friendswho are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well.They&#39;re going to be entering this car one by one.We&#39;ll act as though we don&#39;t know each other.And we&#39;ll act as if it&#39;s just an unfortunate mistake we&#39;ve made,forgetting our pants on this cold January day.(Laughter)So at this point,she decides to put the rape book away.(Laughter)And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings.
时间： 2:17
zh-cn:这时候摄像头旁的两名丹麦男子已经乐不可支了他们觉得这是自己看到的最搞笑的事情你看她在跟他们眼神示意（笑声）我最喜欢视频里这一刻因为这成为一个共同经历这事也许有点吓人至少有点让人摸不着头脑但是一旦这一经历被人所共享我就变成一个搞笑滑稽的主体
en:Now in the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera,they&#39;re cracking up.They think this is the funniest thing they&#39;ve ever seen before.And watch her make eye contact with them right about now.(Laughter)And I love that moment in this video,because before it became a shared experience,it was something that was maybe a little bit scary,or something that was at least confusing to her.And then once it became a shared experience,it was funny and something that she could laugh at.

zh-cn:现在到了6号线第三站（笑声）这个视频不会展示全部接下来还有四站7个只穿内裤的男人陆续上车第八站一个提着大帆布袋子的女士上车了一美元一条裤子减价大甩卖就象别人在车上卖电池或者糖果之类我们每人买了一条裤子穿上然后对她说：“多谢了，真是雪中送炭！”然后不说什么都下车了各奔东西
en:So the train is now pulling intothe third stop along the 6 line.(Laughter)So the video won&#39;t show everything.This goes on for another four stops.A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear.At the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bagand announced she had pants for sale for a dollar —like you might sell batteries or candy on the train.We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants, put them onand said, &quot;Thank you. That&#39;s exactly what I needed today,&quot;and then exited without revealing what had happenedand went in all different directions.

zh-cn:这是暂停的一个画面我十分喜欢她对此的反应那天晚些时候我又看了看这个视频这启发了我应该继续做类似的事而“随处即兴”的宗旨就是在公共场合创造一个对其他人来说成为积极经历的场景这是个恶作剧，但这个恶作剧得以让人们分享很棒的故事她的反应启发了我来举办第二届“不穿裤子乘地铁”这变成一项年度活动今年1月，我们举办了第十届“不穿裤子乘地铁”大约有3,500名各种背景的人在纽约地铁上共同上演了这个好戏－几乎每一趟列车上都能见到同时在世界各地其他50个城市也有人参与了
en:So that&#39;s a still from the video there.And I love that girl&#39;s reaction so much.And watching that videotape later that dayinspired me to keep doing what I do.And really one of the points of Improv Everywhereis to cause a scene in a public placethat is a positive experience for other people.It&#39;s a prank, but it&#39;s a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell.And her reaction inspired meto do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.And we&#39;ve continued to do it every year.This January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ridewhere a diverse group of 3,500 peoplerode the train in their underwear in New York —almost every single train line in the city.And also in 50 other cities around the world,people participated.

zh-cn:我开始在正直公民旅团剧院上即兴艺术的课程并得以见到其他的创意人士，演员和喜剧明星们我开始大量收集对此类行动有兴趣的人的邮件地址来扩大我的表演阵容一天我经过联合广场看到这栋楼于2005落成有一个橱窗前一个女孩在跳舞非常奇特的景象因为周围都很暗 荧光从她背后照过来就是浑然天成的舞台一样我不明白她干嘛这么做大概15秒后她的朋友出现了－她躲在一个展板后面她们大笑着拥抱了对方然后跑开了估计她们在玩真心话大冒险我受到了启发我望着整栋楼的正面－一共有70个窗户我知道怎么办了
en:As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theaterand meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians,I started amassing a mailing listof people who wanted to do these types of projects.So I could do more large-scale projects.Well one day I was walking through Union Square,and I saw this building,which had just been built in 2005.And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.And it was very peculiar,because it was dark out, but she was back-lit with florescent lighting,and she was very much onstage,and I couldn&#39;t figure out why she was doing it.After about 15 seconds, her friend appeared —she had been hiding behind a display —and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away.So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this.So I got inspired by that.Looking at the entire facade — there were 70 total windows —and I knew what I had to do.

zh-cn:这个活动就叫做“再抬头看看”，我们有70个着黑衣的舞者这未经批准我们不想商场知道我们的计划我站在公园给指示第一个指示是每个人都举起这些四英尺高的字母拼起来就是“再抬头看看”即活动名称第二个指示是每个人做踢腿跳你这会儿就能看到（笑声）然后是跳舞 每个人都跳接下来就是独舞所有人就都指着他们（笑声）然后我的手出了一个新指示示意楼下Forever21的人独舞他就跳起来了还有一些其他形式的表演有的上下蹦跳有的摔倒地上我就穿着一件套头衫，默默站在人群里把手放上放下一个垃圾桶来给出下一步的指示因为这是在联合广场公园 离地铁站很近最后有好几百人停下来观看我们的表演这个照片比较清楚
en:So this project is called Look Up More. We had 70 actors dress in black.This was completely unauthorized.We didn&#39;t let the stores know we were coming.And I stood in the park giving signals.The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall lettersthat spelled out &quot;Look Up More,&quot;the name of the project.The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together.You&#39;ll see that start right here.(Laughter)And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.And then we had dance solos where only one person would danceand everybody would point to them.(Laughter)So then I gave a new hand signal,which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21,and he danced.There were several other activities.We had people jumping up and down,people dropping to the ground.And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt,putting my hand on and off of a trashcanto signal the advancement.And because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station,there were hundreds of people by the endwho stopped and looked upand watched what we were doing.There&#39;s a better photo of it.

zh-cn:那么这个活动仅仅是由我受自己偶然间的观察启发而生的下一个我想分享的项目来自一个陌生人的电子邮件2006年德克萨斯一个高中生写信给我说：“你应该聚齐尽可能多的人穿着蓝色polo衫和卡其裤子跑到百思买去站着。”（笑声）（掌声）我立马给他回了邮件说：“你说的一点没错。这周末我就会努力实行，谢谢！”就是这个视频
en:So that particular eventwas inspired by a momentthat I happened to stumble upon.The next project I want to showwas given to me in an email from a stranger.A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006and said, &quot;You should get as many people as possibleto put on blue polo shirts and khaki pantsand go into a Best Buy and stand around.&quot;(Laughter)(Applause)So I wrote this high school kid back immediately,and I said, &quot;Yes, you are correct.I think I&#39;ll try to do that this weekend. Thank you.&quot;So here&#39;s the video.
时间： 6:48
zh-cn:这还是在2005年纽约市的百思买大约有80人参加他们一个接一个进入商店有八岁的女孩，十岁的女孩还有65岁的男人都参加了因此参加人员十分广泛我告诉他们：“别表现出你真在工作但是也别买什么就四处转转别看产品。”正式职员的T恤上是有黄色牌子的其他的都是我们的演员（笑声）基层职员觉得这很搞笑实际上，甚至有人从休息室拿了相机要和我们拍照留念很多人开玩笑说让我们一起去仓库为客人把沉重的电视机抬出来不过，商店的经理和保安可没觉得这有什么搞笑的这个镜头里能看到他们穿着黄色或者黑色T恤我们待了大概10钟经理觉得要打911报警了
en:So again, this is 2005.This is the Best Buy in New York City.We had about 80 people show up to participate,entering one-by-one.There was an eight year-old girl, a 10 year-old girl.There was also a 65 year-old manwho participated.So a very diverse group of people.And I told people, &quot;Don&#39;t work. Don&#39;t actually do work.But also, don&#39;t shop.Just stand around and don&#39;t face products.&quot;Now you can see the regular employeesby the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt.Everybody else is one of our actors.(Laughter)The lower level employees thought it was very funny.And in fact, several of them went to go get their camera from the break roomand took photos with us.A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the backto get heavy television sets for customers.The managers and the security guards, on the other hand,did not find it particularly funny.You can see them in this footage.They&#39;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt.And we were there probably 10 minutesbefore the managers decided to dial 911.

zh-cn:于是他们就开始到处跑通知其他人，注意点，警察要来了这个镜头里能看到警察一个隐蔽摄像头拍到了这个警察最终警察告诉百思买的经理穿蓝色polo衫和卡其裤不能算违法
en:So they started running aroundtelling everybody the cops were coming, watch out, the cops were coming.And you can see the cops in this footage right here.That&#39;s a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera.Ultimately, the police had to inform Best Buy managementthat it was not, in fact, illegalto wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.

zh-cn:于是我们待了将近有20分钟后， 愉快地离开了百思买经理尝试要追查我们的相机他们发现我们几个人在帆布包里藏里摄像机但是有个摄像的却一直没被发现他带里个空带进去进了百思买的相机摄影机部门就把空带放进其中一个摄像机假装试机我很喜欢这个想法，用他们的技术应对对方
en:So we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store.One thing the managers were trying to dowas to track down our cameras.And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.But the one camera guy they never caughtwas the guy that went in just with a blank tapeand went over to the Best Buy camera departmentand just put his tape in one of their camerasand pretended to shop.So I like that concept of using their own technology against them.

zh-cn:我想最好的行动计划是在特定场所有原因地发生有天早上我去乘地铁我得在53街站换乘那儿有两个超长的电梯而那是个让人一大早就感到很压抑的地方 人非常多我决定要尝试点什么，演上一出能让人觉得开心 哪怕只是一早上这是2009年冬天－早上八点半上班高峰期外面非常冷都是从皇后区过来的乘客从E号线转乘6号线他们搭着这超长电梯去往工作的路上
en:I think our best projects are ones that are site specificand happen at a particular place for a reason.And one morning, I was riding the subway.I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stopwhere there are these two giant escalators.And it&#39;s a very depressing place to be in the morning, it&#39;s very crowded.So I decided to try and stage somethingthat could make it as happy as possible for one morning.So this was in the winter of 2009 —8:30 in the morning.It&#39;s morning rush hour.It&#39;s very cold outside.People are coming in from Queens,transferring from the E train to the 6 train.And they&#39;re going up these giant escalatorson their way to their jobs.

en:Thank you.So there&#39;s a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better.He gave 2,000 high fives that day,and he washed his hands before and afterwardand did not get sick.And that was done also without permission,although no one seemed to care.

zh-cn:这几年我见过Youtube上对于“随处即兴”最常见的评论之一是“这帮人真是闲得慌”不是每个人都喜欢你做的所有事多亏这些评论我变得厚脸皮了但就是这个评论很烦人因为我们并没有那么闲“随处即兴”的参与者不比其他纽约人空闲时间多他们只是偶尔选择一种不同的方式来休闲
en:So I&#39;d say over the years,one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhereleft anonymously on YouTube commentsis: &quot;These people have too much time on their hands.&quot;And you know, not everybody&#39;s going to like everything you do,and I&#39;ve certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments,but that one&#39;s always bothered me,because we don&#39;t have too much time on our hands.The participants at Improv Everywhere eventshave just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers,they just occasionally chooseto spend it in an unusual way.
时间：10:33
zh-cn:每年秋天每个周末就有成千上万的人去美式橄榄球场看球从来没见谁看着比赛说：“看台上的这帮人真闲啊！”当然不是这样这只是一个度过周末下午的美好方式在体育场看场球赛我觉得200人一齐在纽约中央车站玩瞬间静止也是很好的度过下午的方式或者穿成捉鬼敢死队的样子在纽约公共图书馆跑来跑去（笑声）或者三千多人一齐听着MP3在公园里无声地跳舞或者在超市突然放声唱歌创作出即兴音乐剧或者一帮人盛装冲进科尼岛的海滩
en:You know, every Saturday and Sunday,hundreds of thousands of people each fallgather in football stadiums to watch games.And I&#39;ve never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game,saying, &quot;All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands.&quot;And of course they don&#39;t.It&#39;s a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon,watching a football game in a stadium.But I think it&#39;s also a perfectly valid wayto spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 peoplein the Grand Central terminalor dressing up like a ghostbusterand running through the New York Public Library.(Laughter)Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other peopleand dancing silently in a park,or bursting into song in a grocery storeas part of a spontaneous musical,or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire.

zh-cn:孩提时候大人教我们玩却从来没问我们为什么要玩玩是积极的事情我想这就是“随处即兴”想要表达的其实我们并没有什么宗旨 也没必要有我们不需要原因去玩只要一件事好玩是个有意思的想法看的人也会一同开心那就足够了作为成年人我们要认识到玩无止尽
en:You know, as kids, we&#39;re taught to play.And we&#39;re never given a reason why we should play.It&#39;s just acceptable that play is a good thing.And I think that&#39;s sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.It&#39;s that there is no point and that there doesn&#39;t have to be a point.We don&#39;t need a reason.As long as it&#39;s funand it seems like it&#39;s going to be a funny ideaand it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time,then that&#39;s enough for us.And I think, as adults, we need to learnthat there&#39;s no right or wrong way to play.
