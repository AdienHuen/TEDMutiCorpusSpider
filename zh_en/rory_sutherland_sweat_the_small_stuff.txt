zh-cn:对我在TEDGlobal（TED全球会议）有印象的观众们大概会记得我曾经提出过一些问题直到现在仍然困扰着我。有一个问题是这样的:为何政府要花费60亿英镑来提速欧洲之星列车而仅仅花费十分之一的预算就可以请到顶级名模们为乘客们免费提供波得路堡红葡萄酒让旅客们享受整个旅程这样政府能省下50亿乘客们还会要求火车减速你大概也记得我的另一个问题一个很有趣的观察那些公路上奇怪的小标示牌持续闪烁着“35“偶尔伴随着一个笑脸或者愁脸取决于你是否超速它们其实比测速机更有效地预防了车祸的发生尽管后者以实施惩罚来警戒驾驶人
en:Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobalremember me asking a few questionswhich still preoccupy me.One of them was: Why is it necessary to spendsix billion poundsspeeding up the Eurostar trainwhen, for about 10 percent of that money,you could have top supermodels, male and female,serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengersfor the entire duration of the journey?You&#39;d still have five billion left in change,and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.Now, you may remember me asking the question as well,a very interesting observation,that actually those strange little signsthat actually flash &quot;35&quot; at you,occasionally accompanying a little smiley faceor a frown,according to whether you&#39;re within or outside the speed limit —those are actually more effectiveat preventing road accidents than speed cameras,which come with the actual threatof real punishment.

zh-cn:因此这里有一种奇怪的失衡在我们解决各种问题的时候特别涉及到人类心理方面时那即是各种组织和机构往往倾向于尽可能布置多的财力物力施加压力然而，最终人们的选择倾向所受的影响往往与其投入成反比这里就出现了一个完全的脱节我认为应该出现一种新型的职业我稍后会谈到并且很有可能引出一个新的英文名词在我看来，众多大型组织包括政府，这一最大的组织在内都变得与群众的实际需要完全脱节了
en:So there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work,I think, in many areas of human problem solving,particularly those which involve human psychology,which is: The tendencyof the organization or the institutionis to deploy as much force as possible,as much compulsion as possible,whereas actually, the tendency of the personis to be almost influencedin absolute reverse proportionto the amount of force being applied.So there seems to be a complete disconnect here.So what I&#39;m asking for is the creation of a new job title —I&#39;ll come to this a little later —and perhaps the addition of a new wordinto the English language.Because it does seem to me that large organizationsincluding government, which is, of course, the largest organization of all,have actually becomecompletely disconnectedwith what actually matters to people.

zh-cn:就此举一个例吧还记得美国在线与时代华纳的合并吧它当时被称为有史以来最大的单笔交易据我所知，很有可能现在仍是我想在座的各位，以这样或那样的途径，都有可能是两家合并公司（之一）的客户那么，是否有人注意到合并带来的任何变化？所以除非你恰好是两公司中某一个的持股者或者是参与到这次“高利润活动”中的交易者或律师否则实际上你根本没有体验到任何变化其实这对所有人都毫无意义与之相反的是，多年来的市场策划让我意识到如果你要让别人记住并感激你的所作所为最有用的其实是那些非常非常小的事这是在维珍大西洋航班的头等舱里这是盐和胡椒调味瓶他们看起来十分可爱，又无足轻重，类似于飞机上的免费用品有趣的是每个人看到它们心里都会偷偷地想说不定我可以把它们带走然而，当你拿起它们时会发现底座刻着这样的话盗于维珍大西洋航班头等舱笑声多年以后当你早已忘记当年坐的是波音777还是空中客机时你会记得那段有趣的话和那次经历
en:Let me give you one example of this.You may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay,heralded at the time as the largestsingle deal of all time.It may still be, for all I know.Now, all of you in this room, in one form or other,are probably customers of one or bothof those organizations that merged.Just interested, did anybody notice anything differentas a result of this at all?So unless you happened to be a shareholderof one or the other organizationsor one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity,you&#39;re actually engaging in a huge piece of activitythat meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody, okay?By contrast, years of marketing have taught methat if you actually want people to remember youand to appreciate what you do,the most potent things are actually very, very small.This is from Virgin Atlantic upper-class,it&#39;s the cruet salt and pepper set.Quite nice in itself, they&#39;re little, sort of, airplane things.What&#39;s really, really sweet is every single person looking at these thingshas exactly the same mischievous thought,which is, &quot;I reckon I can heist these.&quot;However, you pick them up and underneath,actually engraved in the metal, are the words,&quot;Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper-class.&quot;(Laughter)Now, years afteryou remember the strategic questionof whether you&#39;re flying in a 777 or an Airbus,you remember those words and that experience.

zh-cn:同样的，这是在斯德克尔摩一个名为Lydmar的宾馆电梯里有人住过那里吗电梯里有一串按钮看似平常然而它们代表的并不是各个楼层最下面的按钮是garage，没什么奇怪的然而再往上却不是底层，中层楼，一，二，三，四这些按钮上其实写着车库，朋克，蓝调它们是供你选择电梯的音乐风格我猜想在Lydmar酒店的电梯里安装一个这样的系统花费至多在500到1000镑但说实话这比绝大多数我们曾住过的酒店更让人印象深刻尽管在那些酒店你常常被告知所住的房间才被装修过耗资50万美元但那不过使它显得和你住过的其他酒店客房一个样
en:Similarly, this is from a hotel in Stockholm, the Lydmar.Has anybody stayed there?It&#39;s the lift, it&#39;s a series of buttons in the lift.Nothing unusual about that at all,except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor.It starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately,but it doesn&#39;t go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four.It actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music.My guess is that the cost of installing this in the liftin the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholmis probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.It&#39;s frankly more memorablethan all those millions of hotels we&#39;ve all stayed atthat tell you that your room has actually been recently renovatedat a cost of 500,000 dollars,in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you&#39;ve ever stayed inin the entire course of your life.

zh-cn:是的，这些都是微小的市场策划的案例。在我最近参与的一次TED活动中, 杜芙洛（法国经济学家）很可能是消除发展中国家贫困现状这一领域的领头专家之一也谈到了这样的案例她提出了一个类似的方案我对此很感兴趣然而在商界和政界看来这个方案是如此的微不足道以至提出它显得让人尴尬这个方案就是提倡孩子的疫苗接种首先让它一种社会性活动我认为这是对行为经济学很好的应用如果你与另外几个母亲一起带着孩子去接种你将比独自去更有信心更重要的是，为了鼓励接种政府应给每个参与接种的人一公斤扁豆这是一件很小很小的事如果你是联合国科教文组织的一个高级官员当某人问起：“那你要怎么消除当今世界的贫困问题呢？“你不可能自信满满地回答”我搞定了，就用扁豆。“ 不是么？
en:Now, these are trivial marketing examples, I accept.But I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo,probably one of the leading experts in,effectively, the eradication of poverty in the developing world,actually spoke.And she came across a similar exampleof something that fascinated meas being something which, in a business context or a government context,would simply be so trivial a solutionas to seem embarrassing.It was simply to encourage the inoculation of childrenby, not only making it a social event —I think good use of behavioral economics in that,if you turn up with several other mothersto have your child inoculated,your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone.But secondly, to incentivize that inoculationby giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated.It&#39;s a tiny, tiny thing.If you&#39;re a senior person at UNESCOand someone says, &quot;So what are you doingto eradicate world poverty?&quot;you&#39;re not really confident standing up theresaying, &quot;I&#39;ve got it cracked; it&#39;s the lentils,&quot; are you?

zh-cn:自夸的心理让我们总觉得重要的问题要用看起来重大且十分昂贵的方式来解决其实不然，行为经济学一再而再地表明在人类干预和行为改变之间其实存在着严重的比例失调那些能够真正改变我们行为和态度的事其实不需要花费其看似所需的财力或物力但机构的本身决定了它无法习惯这种不成比例于是便造成机构中负责解决问题的人往往拥有巨额的预算而一旦有了巨额预算人们便不由自主地寻找费钱的方式去解决问题当今我们缺乏的正是那些有着巨大权利却分文没有的人笑声我希望在这日新月异的世界中能出现这样的人才
en:Our own sense of self-aggrandizementfeels that big important problemsneed to have big important, and most of all, expensivesolutions attached to them.And yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after timeis in human behavioral and behavioral changethere&#39;s a very, very strong disproportionality at work,that actually what changes our behaviorand what changes our attitude to thingsis not actually proportionate to the degreeof expense entailed,or the degree of force that&#39;s applied.But everything about institutionsmakes them uncomfortablewith that disproportionality.So what happens in an institutionis the very person who has the power to solve the problemalso has a very, very large budget.And once you have a very, very large budget,you actually look for expensive things to spend it on.What is completely lacking is a class of peoplewho have immense amounts of power, but no money at all.(Laughter)It&#39;s those people I&#39;d quite like to createin the world going forward.

zh-cn:还有一个现象我有时把它称之为“第五航站楼综合症”它是指：要完成耗资巨大的重要事件需要人们集中才智和精力人们会取得很不错的成果，比如5号航站楼是绝对的宏伟摩登然而直到你注意到一些小细节的实用性，就会发现比如它的指示牌其实是相当糟糕的走出机场的“抵达”口后你看到面前一个黄色的指示牌上写着“火车”于是你跟随指示走上几百码搜寻着新的指示牌期待着黄色的“火车”标志然而下一个却是蓝色的，在你的左方上面写着“希斯罗高速”这简直太像电影“飞机”里的搞笑场景了黄色的指示牌？那正是他们所期待的。
en:Now, here&#39;s another thing that happens,which is what I call sometimes &quot;Terminal 5 syndrome,&quot;which is that big, expensive thingsget big, highly-intelligent attention,and they&#39;re great, and Terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent,until you get down to the small detail, the usability,which is the signage,which is catastrophic.You come out of &quot;Arrive&quot; at the airport, and you followa big yellow sign that says &quot;Trains&quot; and it&#39;s in front of you.So you walk for another hundred yards,expecting perhaps another sign,that might courteously be yellow, in front of you and saying &quot;Trains.&quot;No, no, no, the next one is actually blue, to your left,and says &quot;Heathrow Express.&quot;I mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film &quot;Airplane.&quot;A yellow sign? That&#39;s exactly what they&#39;ll be expecting.

zh-cn:实际上，当今世界越来越多地出现这种情况全归功于英国机场当局（对细节的忽略）我曾经也谈到过这个问题当时一个睿智的人后来问我&quot;好吧，那你说应该怎么办？“我给了他五个建议，而我的建议竟然被采纳了。但是其中的一个建议尽管逻辑上讲是不错的即是电梯里不安上下键但如果电梯只在两层楼间运作的话那样其实是很恐怖的一件事因为当门关上后你什么都不用做了仿佛此刻你一脚踏进了恐怖电影的场景里
en:Actually, what happens in the world increasingly —now, all credit to the British Airport Authority.I spoke about this before,and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said, &quot;Okay, what can you do?&quot;So I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.One of them also being,although logically it&#39;s quite a good ideato have a lift with no up and down button in it,if it only serves two floors,it&#39;s actually bloody terrifying, okay?Because when the door closesand there&#39;s nothing for you to do,you&#39;ve actually just stepped into a Hammer film.

zh-cn:这种种的问题都说明了，当今世界重大的问题被解决得很好而细节问题，类似于用户连接口的问题却解决得十分糟糕同时，在解决这些细节问题时人们往往陷入一种僵局因为那些真正能够解决问题的人往往权高位重，整天忙于思考“战略性”的问题而不是实际地去解决说到银行业，我最近遇到了这样一件事一些银行业人士向我咨询“我们能够以广告来竞争吗？我们怎样能推广银行在线业务呢我说，“这其实相当简单。“比如，“当人们登陆到他们的网上银行里是为了查看各种信息而最不愿意看到的就是自己的结余。我有一些朋友从来没有用过自己银行的现金取款机仅仅因为怕在屏幕上看到自己的结余。
en:So these questions ... what is happening in the worldis the big stuff, actually,is done magnificently well.But the small stuff, what you might call the user interface,is done spectacularly badly.But also, there seems to be a complete sort of gridlockin terms of solving these small solutions.Because the people who can actually solve themactually are too powerful and too preoccupiedwith something they think of as &quot;strategy&quot; to actually solve them.I tried this exercise recently, talking about banking.They said, &quot;Can we do an advertising campaign?What can we do and encourage more online banking?&quot;I said, &quot;It&#39;s really, really easy.&quot;I said, &quot;When people login to their online bankthere are lots and lots of things they&#39;d probably quite like to look at.The last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance.&quot;I&#39;ve got friends who actuallynever use their own bank cash machinesbecause there&#39;s the risk that it might displaytheir balance on the screen.

zh-cn:谁愿意让自己得知坏消息呢？我才不呢我告诉他们，“如果你们把“显示我的结余”改为可选而不是让它自动显示那么你登陆网上银行的客户将会翻一番并且登陆频率增加两倍说实话，我们在座有多少人会在取现后查看自己的收支状况？还不用说按世界平均水平来看你们大多属于有钱人看吧，一个也没有或者说即使有也不愿承认自己会那样做关于这些提议，有趣的是要实行它花不了一千英镑实际花得挺少不过50磅左右然而它至今没有被实行
en:Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news?Okay, you simply wouldn&#39;t.I said, &quot;If you make, actually, &#39;Tell me my balance.&#39;If you make that an option rather than the default,you&#39;ll find twice as many people log on to online banking,and they do it three times as often.&quot;Let&#39;s face it, most of us — how many of youactually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine?And you&#39;re pretty rich by the standards of the world at large.Now, interesting that no single person does that,or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it.But what&#39;s interesting about that suggestionwas that, to implement that suggestion wouldn&#39;t cost 10 million pounds;it wouldn&#39;t involve large amounts of expenditure;it would actually cost about 50 quid.And yet, it never happens.

zh-cn:这就回到了我所说的严重脱节问题上即有权的人想做费钱的事现在有一种策略误解现象在商界很普遍如果多加思考便会发现，其实是非常有必要维持这种现状的因为董事会得说服公司成员任何集体的成功都几乎完全归功于董事会所作的决策这才能使薪水上巨大的差异显得更加合理而不是去承认公司的成功其实在于许多别的方面比如那些微不足道的战略性活动
en:Because there&#39;s a fundamental disconnect, as I said,that actually, the people with the powerwant to do big expensive things.And there&#39;s to some extent a big strategy myththat&#39;s prevalent in business now.And if you think about it, it&#39;s very, very importantthat the strategy myth is maintained.Because, if the board of directors convince everybodythat the success of any organizationis almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors,it makes the disparity in salariesslightly more justifiablethan if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company&#39;s successmight actually lie somewhere else,in small pieces of tactical activity.
时间： 9:22
zh-cn:然而，现在的实际情况是——电子表格并没有促成这一状况很多事情也与此无关——在商界和政界都有一种妒忌心理它们希望这在个世界里投入与产出是成正比的我们都喜欢生活在一个符合机械理论的世界里所有的事物都可以通过数据清晰地在电子表格上表示出来而你在事物上所花的时间将与你的收效成正比这样的世界大家都渴望而我们也的确生活在一个以科学为基调的世界不幸的是，这里科学可能更接近于气象学在很多情况下微小的改变也可能带来天翻地覆的变化而恰恰相反，大范围的运作，巨大的公司合并到头来却没有带来任何改变但要我们承认这一点是十分困难的
en:But what is happening is that effectively —and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn&#39;t helped this;lots of things haven&#39;t helped this —business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy.It wants the world to be the kind of place wherethe input and the change are proportionate.It&#39;s a kind of mechanistic worldthat we&#39;d all love to live inwhere, effectively, it sits very nicely on spreadsheets,everything is numerically expressible,and the amount you spend on something is proportionateto the scale of your success.That&#39;s the world people actually want.In truth, we do live in a world that science can understand.Unfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatologyin that in many cases,very, very small changescan have disproportionately huge effects,and equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers,can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all.But it&#39;s very, very uncomfortable for usto actually acknowledge that we&#39;re living in such a world.

zh-cn:我想说的是，许多事情将会变得更加容易如果我们把问题分成这样四大类这才是一种策略，当然不否认每种策略都有它的适用性要知道，毕竟也有的事情是需要花费大量财力才能取得大的成果我不否认这一点接下来我们就来说一下咨询方面
en:But what I&#39;m saying is we could just make thingsa little bit better for ourselvesif we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach.That is actually strategy, and I&#39;m not denying that strategy has a role.You know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of moneyand you accomplish quite a lot.And I&#39;d be wrong to dis that completely.Moving over, we come, of course, to consultancy.

zh-cn:在我看来，埃森哲（一家咨询公司，主要提供管理咨询，技术咨询和外包服务）这样草率地抛弃泰格伍兹是一件很不光彩的事因为泰格实际上是遵循了埃森哲服务模式的他为性服务建立起一个有趣的外包模式笑声不再被单一的供货商垄断(婚外性行为）在很多情况下本地采购（性伴侣）同时，在任何时候都能保证一到三个女孩供应使得负载更加平衡所以我实在搞不懂为什么埃森哲突然不喜欢泰格了
en:I thought it was very indecent of Accentureto ditch Tiger Woods in sucha sort of hurried and hasty way.I mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model.He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services,(Laughter)no longer tied to a single monopoly provider,in many cases, sourcing things locally,and of course, the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any timeled for better load-balancing.So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that, I&#39;m not sure.

zh-cn:还有一类事情尽管不需要花费太多，却无法取得任何成效人们称之为琐碎但最后这一类事情，即第四类我们难以用言语来描述我们不知如何指代它而且我们很少花费资金来寻找这类事它们尽管微不足道，但却有可能带来大的改变如果确实起了作用那么它们将取得的成功绝对会远远超出当初所投入的人力物力和造成的干扰
en:Then there are other things that don&#39;t cost much and achieve absolutely nothing.That&#39;s called trivia.But there&#39;s a fourth thing.And the fundamental problem is we don&#39;t actually have a word for this stuff.We don&#39;t know what to call it.And actually we don&#39;t spend nearly enough moneylooking for those things,looking for those tiny things that may or may not work,but which, if they do work,can have a success absolutely out of proportionto their expense, their effortsand the disruption they cause.

zh-cn:因此，首先我希望每一个看过这次演讲的人都来参与这样一个竞赛即为右下角的这第四种事物命其次，我认为这个世界需要有人来掌握这种事物这就是为什么我呼吁“细节总官员”的设立每个公司都应该有一个这样的职位而每个政府都应该有一个细节部门担任此职的人不应当有钱或者豪华预算并且要能意识这样一点付双倍的代价有可能在政府工作中取得更大的政绩但你也往往也能取得同样的效果仅仅通过重新设计表格并以更易懂的英文表述如果我们的政界能设立一个细节部门而商界有一个总细节长官那么这第四类常可悲地被人遗忘的事物可能最终将得到其应有的关注
en:So the first thing I&#39;d likeis a competition — to anybody watching this as a film —is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right.And the second thing, I think,is that the world needs to have people in charge of that.That&#39;s why I call for the &quot;Chief Detail Officer.&quot;Every corporation should have one,and every government should have a Ministry of Detail.The people who actually have no money,who have no extravagant budget,but who realize that actuallyyou might achieve greater success in uptakeof a government programby actually doubling the level of benefits you pay,but you&#39;ll probably achieve exactly that same effectsimply by redesigning the formand writing it in comprehensible English.And if actually we created a Ministry of Detailand business actually had Chief Detail Officers,then that fourth quadrant,which is so woefully neglected at the moment,might finally get the attention it deserves.
