zh-cn:整整十年以前，我在阿富汗。我当时在报道阿富汗战争，作为卡塔尔半岛电视台的一名记者，我亲眼见证了这样一场战争酿成了多少苦难与破坏。接着，两年之后，我又报道了另一场战争－伊拉克战争。我被调到了战争的中心地带因为我当时正从伊拉克北部对战争进行报道。战争结束了推翻了一个政权，与阿富汗战争如出一辙。而那个被我们推翻的政权实际上是一个独裁政权，一个专制统治，几十年里让整个国家内部以及民众感到无能为力。然而，外国干预所带来的变革却对那些人民造成了更坏的影响并使那里的人民倍感无助与自卑。
en:Ten years ago exactly,I was in Afghanistan.I was covering the war in Afghanistan,and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera,the amount of suffering and destructionthat emerged out of a war like that.Then, two years later,I covered another war — the war in Iraq.I was placed at the center of that warbecause I was covering the warfrom the northern part of Iraq.And the war endedwith a regime change,like the one in Afghanistan.And that regimethat we got rid ofwas actually a dictatorship,an authoritarian regime,that for decadescreated a great sense of paralysiswithin the nation, within the people themselves.However,the change that came through foreign interventioncreated even worse circumstances for the peopleand deepened the senseof paralysis and inferiorityin that part of the world.

zh-cn:在几十年里，我们生活在专制统治之下－在阿拉伯世界，在中东地区。这些政权这段时期内在我们内心创造了一样东西。我现在43岁了。在过去的40年里，我所见过统治我们的君王与总统几乎都拥有一样的面孔－苍老，独裁，腐败－这些就是我们经历过的政权。有一刻，我曾好奇，我们是否能够在有生之年见识到这片土地上发生一次真正的变革这种变革不来自外国干预，不会导致被占领的苦难没有外国入侵我们的土地我们的自卑感也不会加深伊拉克人说：是的，他们推翻了萨达姆. 侯赛因但当他们看到他们的土地被外国势力占领他们感到非常悲伤他们感到自己的尊严遭到了践踏正因如此他们才开始起义反抗正因如此他们才不愿接受实际上，其它政权，告诉他们的人民“你们希望见到伊拉克的现状吗？你们希望看到内战和宗派屠杀吗？你们希望看到破坏吗？你们希望看到外国军队进驻你们的土地吗？”而这些人民寻思“也许我们应该继续生活在现有的政权之下而不是选择这个可能。”这是我们最可怕的噩梦之一
en:For decades,we have lived under authoritarian regimes —in the Arab world, in the Middle East.These regimescreated something within us during this period.I&#39;m 43 years old right now.For the last 40 years,I have seen almost the same facesfor kings and presidents ruling us —old, aged, authoritarian,corrupt situations —regimes that we have seen around us.And for a moment I was wondering,are we going to live in order to seereal change happening on the ground,a change that does not come through foreign intervention,through the misery of occupation,through nations invading our landand deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein,but when they sawtheir land occupied by foreign forcesthey felt very sad,they felt that their dignity had suffered.And this is why they revolted.This is why they did not accept.And actually other regimes, they told their citizens,&quot;Would you like to see the situation of Iraq?Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing?Would you like to see destruction?Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?&quot;And the people thought for themselves,&quot;Maybe we should live withthis kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in,instead of having the second scenario.&quot;That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.

zh-cn:整整十年里很不幸地，我们一直报道破坏的画面宗派冲突屠杀的画面一片广袤土地上不断出现暴力的画面这里几千年来一直是众多文明，艺术与文化的发祥地我在这里想告诉大家我们梦想中的未来已经到来了新的一代人得到了良好的教育团结在一起被普遍的价值观所激励并拥有全球化的视角这一代人已经为我们开辟了新的现实我们找到了一种新的途径来表达我们的感情和梦想这些年轻人重塑了我们国家在阿拉伯世界中的自信他们给了我们新意义下的自由让我们得到了走到大街上表达意愿的权力什么也没发生 没有暴力 风平浪静只要走出你的家门抬高你的嗓音呐喊：“我们希望这个政权下台。”
en:For 10 years,unfortunately we have found ourselvesreporting images of destruction,images of killing,of sectarian conflicts,images of violence,emerging from a magnificent piece of land,a region that one day was the sourceof civilizations and art and culturefor thousands of years.Now I am here to tell youthat the futurethat we were dreaming forhas eventually arrived.A new generation,well-educated,connected,inspired by universal valuesand a global understanding,has created a new reality for us.We have found a new wayto express our feelingsand to express our dreams:these young peoplewho have restored self-confidencein our nations in that part of the world,who have given usnew meaning for freedomand empowered us to go down to the streets.Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing.Just step out of your house,raise your voiceand say, &quot;We would like to see the end of the regime.&quot;

zh-cn:这就在突尼斯发生了几天以前突尼斯政权，它曾投入了几十亿美元在安全机构，几十亿美元花在了维护，试图维护国家的监狱这个政权垮台了，湮灭在了人民的呼喊声中人们被激励着走上大街小巷大声呐喊他们不达目的不罢休情报局想要逮捕这些人他们找到了叫“Facebook”的东西找到了叫“推特”的东西他们为之而感到惊讶他们说：“这些孩子被误导了。”于是，他们让孩子的父母到大街上去把他们领回家去这就是他们说宣扬的，这是他们的阴谋“把这些孩子领回家去因为他们被误导了。”然而，是的这些普遍价值观所激励的年轻人这些对辉煌的未来抱着满腔理想的年轻人而这些年轻人也脚踏实地在这种理想与理想的实践过程之间取得了平衡不使用暴力不制造混乱这些年轻人没有回家他们的父母去到大街上支持他们这就是突尼斯变革的由来
en:This is what happened in Tunisia.Over a few days,the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollarsin the security agencies,billions of dollarsin maintaining, trying to maintain,its prisons,collapsed, disappeared,because of the voices of the public.People who were inspired to go down to the streetsand to raise their voices,they tried to kill.The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.They found something called Facebook.They found something called Twitter.They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.And they said,&quot;These kids are misled.&quot;Therefore, they asked their parentsto go down to the streetsand collect them, bring them back home.This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.&quot;Bring these kids homebecause they are misled.&quot;But yes,these youthwho have been inspiredby universal values,who are idealistic enoughto imagine a magnificent futureand, at the same time, realistic enoughto balance this kind of imaginationand the process leading to it —not using violence,not trying to create chaos —these young people,they did not go home.Parents actually went to the streetsand they supported them.And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.

zh-cn:我们卡塔尔半岛电视台在突尼斯已被禁多年当地政府不允许任何卡塔尔半岛电视台记者靠近但我们发现这些在大街上抗议的人们都变成了我们的记者为我们的演播室不停注入图片，视频以及新闻突然间，位于多哈的演播室成为了一个中心专门收集各种来自于普通民众的信息－－他们团结在一起，拥有抱负从自卑感中将自己解放出来于是我们决定：我们要把这些新闻都报导出来我们要成为这些民众的喉舌我们要将消息传播出去是的，这些年轻人中的一些人通过互联网相互联系了起来然而，阿拉伯世界的联系还非常有限，非常微小造成这种现象的原因是我们面临了很多问题而卡塔尔半岛电视台收集了民众的声音加以放大我们让这声音传遍阿拉伯世界每个家庭的起居室并通过我们的英文频道传向世界，传遍全球
en:We in Al Jazeerawere banned from Tunisia for years,and the government did not allowany Al Jazeera reporter to be there.But we found that these people in the street,all of them are our reporters,feeding our newsroomwith pictures, with videosand with news.And suddenly that newsroom in Dohabecame a centerthat received all this kind of input from ordinary people —people who are connected and people who have ambitionand who have liberated themselvesfrom the feeling of inferiority.And then we took that decision:We are unrolling the news.We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.We are going to spread the message.Yes, some of these young peopleare connected to the Internet,but the connectivity in the Arab worldis very little, is very small,because of many problems that we are suffering from.But Al Jazeera took the voice from these peopleand we amplified [it].We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world —and internationally, globally,through our English channel.

zh-cn:到时候，人民会开始感觉到一股新的势力正在发生后来扎因·阿比丁·本·阿里（突尼斯前总统）决定离开了接着，埃及的抗议发生了于是，穆巴拉克决定离开了而现在轮到利比亚了接下来是也门你会看到其它许多国家争相想要看到并重新体验那种感觉“我们如何想象一个辉煌，和平，宽容的未来呢？”我想告诉大家互联网和人们直接的联系已经创造出了一种新思维但是这种思维仍然对这片生养它的土地充满赤诚这与之前许多寻求变革的行动有着很大的不同之处之前我们认为，政府也告诉我们－－有时候这也是真的－－那就是，当变革被强加于我们人们会产生抵触这是因为他们认为这不属于他们的文化我们一直相信变革是从内部孕育而生的这变革应当与文化文化多样性与我们对传统以及历史的信仰相互融合与此同时这变革包容了普遍的价值观，与世界相联结包容外部世界现在就是阿拉伯世界发生变革的时刻这是正确的时刻，是绝佳的时刻我们看到了这些重要意义相互交汇并创造了这片土地上辉煌新时代的开端
en:And then people started to feelthat there&#39;s something new happening.And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Alidecided to leave.And then Egypt started,and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.And now Libya as you see it.And then you have Yemen.And you have many other countries trying to seeand to rediscover that feelingof, &quot;How do we imagine a futurewhich is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?&quot;I want to tell you something,that the Internet and connectivityhas created [a] new mindset.But this mindsethas continued to be faithfulto the soil and to the landthat it emerged from.And while this was the major differencebetween many initiatives beforeto create change,before we thought, and governments told us —and even sometimes it was true —that change was imposed on us,and people rejected that,because they thought that it is alien to their culture.Always, we believedthat change will spring from within,that change should be a reconciliationwith culture, cultural diversity,with our faith in our traditionand in our history,but at the same time,open to universal values, connected with the world,tolerant to the outside.And this is the momentthat is happening right now in the Arab world.This is the right moment, and this is the actual momentthat we see all of these meanings meet togetherand then create the beginningof this magnificent erathat will emerge from the region.

zh-cn:那些顶尖人物将如何应对－－那些所谓的政治精英会怎么做？面对Facebook他们把骆驼拉到开罗的解放广场上面对卡塔尔半岛电视台他们开始结党营私当他们失败了他们就宣称有人在特拉维夫制造阴谋以此分裂阿拉伯世界他们开始警告西方“小心基地组织基地组织主宰了我们的土地这些人信仰伊斯兰教想要建立新的Imaras小心这些人他们正准备对付你们摧毁你们伟大的文明”真不巧人们现在可没那么好骗了因为，这个地区腐败的当权者已经丧失了欺骗的能力他们不论是过去还是现在都想象不到他们将如何面对这样的现实他们丧失了－－他们被广大人民所背弃现在，我们目睹他们一个接着一个相继垮台
en:How did the elite deal with that —the so-called political elite?In front of Facebook,they brought the camels in Tahrir Square.In front of Al Jazeera,they started creating tribalism.And then when they failed,they started speaking about conspiraciesthat emerged from Tel Aviv and Washingtonin order to divide the Arab world.They started telling the West,&quot;Be aware of Al-Qaeda.Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories.These are Islamiststrying to create new Imaras.Be aware of these peoplewho [are] coming to youin order to ruin your great civilization.&quot;Fortunately,people right now cannot be deceived.Because this corrupt elitein that regionhas lost even the power of deception.They could not, and they cannot, imaginehow they could really deal with this reality.They have lost.They have been detachedfrom their people, from the masses,and now we are seeing them collapsingone after the other.

zh-cn:卡塔尔半岛电视台不是变革的工具我们并不能创造变革然而当这样重大的重大事件发生时我们就成为了时事报导的中心我们在埃及被禁我们的驻地记者有的被逮捕但我们大多数的摄影师我们的记者们他们自发进入埃及－－完全自愿秘密对解放广场上的情况进行报导18天里我们的摄影机实时播出解放广场上民众的呼声我记得，一天晚上某人打通了我的手机－－一个我不认识的平民－－从解放广场打来的他告诉我：“我们恳请你不要关掉摄像机如果你们关掉了摄像机今晚将会发生一场大屠杀你们实时报导解放广场的状况就是在保护我们。”我感到我有责任给当地的记者们以及我们的新闻演播室打电话告诉他们：“你们要竭尽全力不要在晚上关掉摄影机因为在场的民众会更有自信因为有人对他们的故事进行报导－－他们还能感觉受到了保护。”
en:Al Jazeera is nota tool of revolution.We do not create revolutions.However,when something of that magnitude happens,we are at the center of the coverage.We were banned from Egypt,and our correspondents,some of them were arrested.But most of our camera peopleand our journalists,they went underground in Egypt — voluntarily —to report what happened in Tahrir Square.For 18 days,our cameras were broadcasting, live,the voices of the people in Tahrir Square.I remember one nightwhen someone phoned me on my cellphone —ordinary person who I don&#39;t know — from Tahrir Square.He told me, &quot;We appeal to younot to switch off the cameras.If you switch off the cameras tonight,there will be a genocide.You are protecting usby showing what is happening at Tahrir Square.&quot;I felt the responsibilityto phone our correspondents thereand to phone our newsroomand to tell them, &quot;Make your bestnot to switch off the cameras at night,because the guys there really feel confidentwhen someone is reporting their story —and they feel protected as well.&quot;

zh-cn:因此，我们有机会在阿拉伯世界创造一个新的未来我们有机会进入新的未来并知道它会向整个世界敞开大门我们不要重蹈伊朗的覆辙进行错误的改革我们应该放弃固有的观点－－尤其是西方国家－－一想起阿拉伯世界就牵扯到石油或者其它基于稳定与安全受到破坏的利益考虑专制统治的稳定与安全只会导致恐怖主义，暴力与破坏我们应当接受人们的选择不要拣选我们所偏爱的人选去主宰他们的未来未来应当由人民自己决定即使有时候他们的呼声会让我们感到恐惧但民主的价值观以及选择的自由此刻正在席卷中东地区这是阿拉伯世界最好的时机让东西半球看到稳定与安全看到友谊与包容正在阿拉伯世界中逐步兴起取代了暴力与恐怖主义的画面我们应当支持这些人民我们应当成为他们的代表我们应当放弃我们狭隘的心胸以拥抱变革为那片土地上的人民欢呼为伟大的未来希望和宽容而庆祝未来就在眼前未来就是现在非常感谢大家
en:So we have a chanceto create a new futurein that part of the world.We have a chanceto go and to think of the futureas something which is open to the world.Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran,of [the] Mosaddeq revolution.Let us free ourselves — especially in the West —from thinking about that part of the worldbased on oil interest,or based on interestsof the illusion of stability and security.The stability and securityof authoritarian regimescannot createbut terrorism and violence and destruction.Let us accept the choice of the people.Let us not pick and choosewho we would like to rule their future.The future should be ruledby people themselves,even sometimes if they are voicesthat might now scare us.But the values of democracyand the freedom of choicethat is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in timeis the best opportunity for the world,for the West and the East,to see stability and to see securityand to see friendship and to see toleranceemerging from the Arab world,rather than the images of violence and terrorism.Let us support these people.Let us stand for them.And let us give upour narrow selfishnessin order to embrace change,and in order to celebrate with the people of that regiona great futureand hope and tolerance.The future has arrived,and the future is now.I thank you very much.

en:Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.We have covered many wars.We have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems,a lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region,because we were centered at the middle of it.But this is a story — it is a great story; it is beautiful.It is not something that you only coverbecause you have to cover a great incident.You are witnessing change in history.You are witnessing the birth of a new era.And this is what the story&#39;s all about.

en:WK: And people actually,after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime,the youth who have organized themselvesin certain groups and councils,they are guarding the transformationand they are trying to put it on a trackin order to satisfythe values of democracy,but at the same timealso to make it reasonableand to make it rational,not to go out of order.In my opinion, these people are much more wiserthan, not only the political elite,even the intellectual elite, even opposition leadersincluding political parties.At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab worldare much more wiserand capable of creating the changethan the old —including the political and culturaland ideologicalold regimes.

en:WK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world —that people care,people care about this great transformation.Mohamed Nanabhay who&#39;s sitting with us,the head of Aljazeera.net,he told me that a 2,500 percent increaseof accessing our websitefrom various parts of the world.Fifty percent of it is coming from America.Because we discovered that people care,and people would like to know —they are receiving the stream through our Internet.Unfortunately in the United States,we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in timefor Al Jazeera English.But I can tell you, this is the moment to celebratethrough connecting ourselveswith those people in the streetand expressing our support to themand expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling,of supporting the weak and the oppressedto create a much better future for all of us.
