zh-cn:我想以两个关于人类物种的现象开始今天的话题第一个现象也许你会觉得显而易见这就是 我们的物种 智人事实上非常非常的聪明聪明的无法形容正如你们现在做的事情地球上其它任何物种都无法做到而且 当然这也许不是第一次你意识到这一点当然 除了聪明意外 我们也是十分自负的物种因此我们喜欢指出我们聪明的这个事实要知道，我可以列举出如莎士比亚或者史蒂芬·考伯特这样的先哲来指出一个事实，那就是我们理性高贵、能力无穷，而且当需要动脑筋的时候是地球上最棒的。
en:I want to start my talk today with two observationsabout the human species.The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,and that&#39;s that our species, Homo sapiens,is actually really, really smart —like, ridiculously smart —like you&#39;re all doing thingsthat no other species on the planet does right now.And this is, of course,not the first time you&#39;ve probably recognized this.Of course, in addition to being smart, we&#39;re also an extremely vain species.So we like pointing out the fact that we&#39;re smart.You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sagefrom Shakespeare to Stephen Colbertto point out things like the fact thatwe&#39;re noble in reason and infinite in facultiesand just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planetwhen it comes to all things cerebral.

zh-cn:但是，当然我更希望将注意力更多的放在人类的第二个现象上而且事实上，虽然我们真的非常聪明，有时候独一无二的聪明，我们有时也在制定决策的时候，变得难以置信的愚蠢。我看到在座的很多开始傻笑，不要担心，我不是来指出你们中的任何一位犯的错误。但是，当然仅仅在过去的两年里，我们见证了许多前所未有的，足以证明人类的无能的例子。我们见到了我们使用特制的工具，将资源从环境中发掘出来，就像突然从我们的脸上爆发一样。我们也看到我们特意创造的，本应该万无一失的金融市场，在我们眼皮子底下轰然坍塌。
en:But of course, there&#39;s a second observation about the human speciesthat I want to focus on a little bit more,and that&#39;s the fact thateven though we&#39;re actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart,we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumbwhen it comes to some aspects of our decision making.Now I&#39;m seeing lots of smirks out there.Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not going to call anyone in particular outon any aspects of your own mistakes.But of course, just in the last two yearswe see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.And we&#39;ve watched as the tools we uniquely maketo pull the resources out of our environmentkind of just blow up in our face.We&#39;ve watched the financial markets that we uniquely create —these markets that were supposed to be foolproof —we&#39;ve watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.

zh-cn:但是，我想这两个令人尴尬的例子并不是人类所犯错误里最让人尴尬的。我们可能更倾向于认为这些错误更像几个烂苹果，或者几个错误的值得在博客上宣扬的决定。但是事实上，社会科学家认为当在一定的环境中，我们中的大多数人都会犯一些非常特定的错误。我们犯的这些错误实际上是可以预判的，我们总是在犯同样的错误。而且对很多证据视而不见。当我们得到负面反馈的时候，却总是在再次面对同样的情况时，犯下同样的错误。所以我觉得困惑：作为研究人类天性的学者，我最好奇的是，我们作为一个如此聪明的种类，为何总是犯如此糟糕，如此类似的错误呢？
en:But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think,don&#39;t highlight what I think is most embarrassingabout the mistakes that humans make,which is that we&#39;d like to think that the mistakes we makeare really just the result of a couple bad applesor a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learningis that most of us, when put in certain contexts,will actually make very specific mistakes.The errors we make are actually predictable.We make them again and again.And they&#39;re actually immune to lots of evidence.When we get negative feedback,we still, the next time we&#39;re face with a certain context,tend to make the same errors.And so this has been a real puzzle to meas a sort of scholar of human nature.What I&#39;m most curious about is,how is a species that&#39;s as smart as we arecapable of such badand such consistent errors all the time?
时间： 2:24
zh-cn:你们知道，我们是最聪明的，为什么对这个问题得不到答案？从某种意义上来说，我们的错误到底从何而来？考虑一阵子之后，我感觉有一些不同的可能性。第一种可能性就是在某种意义上，这的确不是我们的错。因为我们是聪明的物种，我们事实上能创造出很多种非常非常复杂的环境，复杂到有时候我们都不能理解，虽然是我们创造出来的。我们创造出了超级复杂的金融市场，和自己都不能应付的房屋贷款条款，而且当然，如果我们处于不能应付的环境中，在某种意义上，是我们自己把一些事情搞砸了。如果这样的话，我们可以很轻松的解决这些人为错误的问题。我们可以说，好吧，让我们挑出我们不能对付的技术，还有那些糟糕的环境，抛弃它们，设计更好的东西，而且我们需要成为我们期待的那种高尚的物种。
en:You know, we&#39;re the smartest thing out there, why can&#39;t we figure this out?In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.One possibility is, in some sense, it&#39;s not really our fault.Because we&#39;re a smart species,we can actually create all kinds of environmentsthat are super, super complicated,sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand,even though we&#39;ve actually created them.We create financial markets that are super complex.We create mortgage terms that we can&#39;t actually deal with.And of course, if we are put in environments where we can&#39;t deal with it,in some sense makes sense that we actuallymight mess certain things up.If this was the case, we&#39;d have a really easy solutionto the problem of human error.We&#39;d actually just say, okay, let&#39;s figure outthe kinds of technologies we can&#39;t deal with,the kinds of environments that are bad —get rid of those, design things better,and we should be the noble speciesthat we expect ourselves to be.
时间： 3:15
zh-cn:但是我更担心的是另外一个可能，那就是，也许不是糟糕的环境的问题，也许问题出在没有设计好的我们自己身上。这是我从观察社会科学家对人类错误的理解而得到的启发。我觉察到人们会一次又一次地以同样的方式犯错误。就好像是我们被造的时候，就设计好了会以某种方式犯错误。这就是我更担心的可能，因为如果我们自己的原因，那就更不清楚应该怎么应对它了。我们也许只能接受这个事实，那就是我们也会犯错误，在设计东西的过程中只能尽可能的避免这些错误。
en:But there&#39;s another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying,which is, maybe it&#39;s not our environments that are messed up.Maybe it&#39;s actually us that&#39;s designed badly.This is a hint that I&#39;ve gottenfrom watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.And what we see is that people tend to keep making errorsexactly the same way, over and over again.It feels like we might almost just be builtto make errors in certain ways.This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about,because, if it&#39;s us that&#39;s messed up,it&#39;s not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.We might just have to accept the fact that we&#39;re error proneand try to design things around it.

zh-cn:所以这就是我和我的学生都很关心的问题，我们如何分辨这两种可能的不同呢？我们需要一个聪明的，能做许多决定，但是和我们的系统——也就是我们可能弄糟的任何东西都互不相干，没有人类的技术，人类的文化，可能甚至没有人类的语言的群体。这就是为什么我们研究他们。这是我的工作对象之一。它是棕色卷尾猴。它们属于新世界灵长科，也就是说它们在三千五百万年前已经与人类得分支脱离了。这样的话，你的曾曾曾。。。祖母大概往上推1千万代，可能和在这里的霍利往上推1千万代的曾曾曾。。。祖母是相同的。为此我们可以放心的说在这里的家伙和我们是真的真的很远的虽然有进化的远亲。关于霍利的好消息是：她实际上没有我们一样的技术。你们知道，她是聪明的，很可爱的小动物，也属于灵长类，而且她没有那些我们自己都搞不懂的东西。所以她应该是比较合适的实验对象。
en:So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?What we need is a populationthat&#39;s basically smart, can make lots of decisions,but doesn&#39;t have access to any of the systems we have,any of the things that might mess us up —no human technology, human culture,maybe even not human language.And so this is why we turned to these guys here.These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.These guys are New World primates,which means they broke off from the human branchabout 35 million years ago.This means that your great, great, great great, great, great —with about five million &quot;greats&quot; in there —grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, greatgrandmother with five million &quot;greats&quot; in thereas Holly up here.You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant,but albeit evolutionary, relative.The good news about Holly though is thatshe doesn&#39;t actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.You know, she&#39;s a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well,but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.So she&#39;s the perfect test case.
时间： 4:47
zh-cn:如果我们把霍利放在跟人类同样的情境里呢？她会不会犯跟我们同样的错误？她是不是不会从中吸取教训呢？等等。。。这些都是我们想探讨的问题。我和我的学生在好几年前就很期待这个实验。我们说，让我们丢给霍利一些人类才有的问题，看看她有什么反应。第一个问题就是，嗯，从哪儿开始呢？因为实验对我们来说很好，但对人类来说就很难了。我们在不同的领域会犯不同的错误。所以，我们的实验到底要从哪儿开始呢？正好实验开始的时候是在金融危机的时候，同时新闻也不停的报道抵押品回收的消息，我们想，也许就从金融领域开始好了。让我们来观察猴子在经济方面的决策，看看他们是不是也犯跟我们一样的错误。
en:What if we put Holly into the same context as humans?Does she make the same mistakes as us?Does she not learn from them? And so on.And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.We said, all right, let&#39;s, you know, throw so problems at Holly,see if she messes these things up.First problem is just, well, where should we start?Because, you know, it&#39;s great for us, but bad for humans.We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.You know, where are we actually going to start with this?And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse,around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,we said, hhmm, maybe we shouldactually start in the financial domain.Maybe we should look at monkey&#39;s economic decisionsand try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.
时间： 5:26
zh-cn:当然，第二个问题也就随之而来,就是方法上的问题，各位可能不知道，猴子是不是用货币的。各位没跟猴子及出国。这就是为什么当你在杂货店或者提款机前面的时候，没看到猴子排在你后面——他们才不做这种事情。所以我们在这儿碰到一点麻烦，如果猴子不用钱，那要怎么让猴子开始用钱呢？我们就像，好吧，稍微忍耐一下，先从教猴子用钱开始。所以我们就照做了。各位看到我手上拿的这个小东西就是我知道的第一个非人类社会的货币的基本单位。我们在开始这项研究的时候没多少创意，所以暂时叫它代币。我们在耶鲁大学教猴子们使用这些货币和人类做交易，用来买不同的水果。它看起来不起眼，实际上也没什么价值。
en:Of course, that&#39;s when we hit a sort second problem —a little bit more methodological —which is that, maybe you guys don&#39;t know,but monkeys don&#39;t actually use money. I know, you haven&#39;t met them.But this is why, you know, they&#39;re not in the queue behind youat the grocery store or the ATM — you know, they don&#39;t do this stuff.So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.How are we actually going to ask monkeys about moneyif they don&#39;t actually use it?So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it upand teach monkeys how to use money.So that&#39;s just what we did.What you&#39;re looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know ofof non-human currency.We weren&#39;t very creative at the time we started these studies,so we just called it a token.But this is the unit of currency that we&#39;ve taught our monkeys at Yaleto actually use with humans,to actually buy different pieces of food.It doesn&#39;t look like much — in fact, it isn&#39;t like much.
时间： 6:12
zh-cn:和我们的货币系统一样，它使用金属做的。就像各位旅行后带回家的各种外币一样，一旦你到家了，这钱也就没法用了。在猴子们了解能用这些代币做什么之前，对它们来说这些东西也一点用都没有。当我们第一次把这些代币放到猴笼里，它们捡了起来，看着这些代币。对它们来说是很奇怪的事情。不过很快这些猴子就认识到，他们可以用这些代币跟实验室里不同的人换食物。可以看到其中一只猴子，五月天，就正在做这件事情。A图到B图是她 正对这些代币感到一点好奇，因为她从来没见过这些东西。图C是实验人员正在伸出手等着，五月天很快就意识到，显然人类想要这个代币。她交出代币，然后就拿到一些食物。不只是五月天，实验室里所有的猴子都懂。这里有个小短片，我们大家来看看发生了什么。这是五月天。她要用代币换食物，她开心的等啊等，然后也顺利的拿到了食物。这是Felix，猴子群的老大，是个大家伙。他也同样耐心的等到了食物的到来。
en:Like most of our money, it&#39;s just a piece of metal.As those of you who&#39;ve taken currencies home from your trip know,once you get home, it&#39;s actually pretty useless.It was useless to the monkeys at firstbefore they realized what they could do with it.When we first gave it to them in their enclosures,they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.They were these kind of weird things.But very quickly, the monkeys realizedthat they could actually hand these tokens overto different humans in the lab for some food.And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.This is A and B are kind of the points where she&#39;s sort of a little bitcurious about these things — doesn&#39;t know.There&#39;s this waiting hand from a human experimenter,and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.Hands it over, and then gets some food.It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get goodat trading tokens with human salesman.So here&#39;s just a quick video of what this looks like.Here&#39;s Mayday. She&#39;s going to be trading a token for some foodand waiting happily and getting her food.Here&#39;s Felix, I think. He&#39;s our alpha male; he&#39;s a kind of big guy.But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.

zh-cn:所以猴子们对交易这件事挺在行。只要很少一点训练他们就能表现得非常好。我们只是放手让他们自己做选择。问题是：这跟人类的货币有什么关系？市场运作就是这样而已？或者我们只是用一些奇特的心理手段，引诱猴子们去做一些事情，看似聪明实际上却并不聪明的事情。所以我们想，如果这真是它们的货币，也真是像我们用钱那样用它，猴子们会做什么样的自然反应？各位可以想象一下，当他们开始用货币彼此做交易的时候，就是他们开始做类似人类做的聪明事情了。他们会开始注意到价格，注意到该用多少价格去买，而且记住这些猴子币的使用情况。看看猴子们是否做了这些事情呢？
en:So the monkeys get really good at this.They&#39;re surprisingly good at this with very little training.We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.The question is: is this anything like human money?Is this a market at all,or did we just do a weird psychologist&#39;s trickby getting monkeys to do something,looking smart, but not really being smart.And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously doif this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?Well, you might actually imagine themto do all the kinds of smart thingsthat humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.You might have them start paying attention to price,paying attention to how much they buy —sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.Do the monkeys do anything like this?
时间： 7:47
zh-cn:于是我们的猴子市集诞生了。它是这样运作的：我们让猴子生活在一种类似动物园的透明笼子里，当它们表现出想要做交易的时候，我们会让它们转移到一个可以进入“市场”的透明笼子里。一进入这个市场——这个市场可比人类的市场有趣多了，因为，当猴子一进入这个市场，人们会给他们一个装满代币的钱包，它们可以用代币和画面中的其中一个人做交易，2个不同的销售员，猴子们可以从他们那儿买到不同的东西。这两位是我实验室里的学生。他们穿着不同的衣服。在一段时间内，销售员会一直做同样的事情，所以猴子们就能意识到谁卖什么价格，谁比较可靠等等之类的事情。各位能看到这2位销售员都拿着一个小小的黄色食物盘，猴子可以用一个代币买盘子里的东西。其实每样东西都值一个代币，但有时候一个代币可以买到比较多的东西，也就是买到比较多的葡萄。
en:And so our monkey marketplace was born.The way this works is thatour monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.When they get a hankering for some treats,we actually allowed them a way outinto a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.Upon entering the market —it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human marketsbecause, as the monkeys entered the door of the market,a human would give them a big wallet full of tokensso they could actually trade the tokenswith one of these two guys here —two different possible human salesmenthat they could actually buy stuff from.The salesmen were students from my lab.They dressed differently; they were different people.And over time, they did basically the same thingso the monkeys could learn, you know,who sold what at what price — you know, who was reliable, who wasn&#39;t, and so on.And you can see that each of the experimentersis actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.and that&#39;s what the monkey can for a single token.So everything costs one token,but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others,sometimes more grapes than others.
时间： 8:43
zh-cn:让我给大家演示一下这个猴子市集的运作情况。这是从猴子的视角拍的，所以比较低。她是小可爱。她有点不耐烦的等着市场开张。然后市场开张了，她有2个选择：买1个葡萄或者2个葡萄。各位可以发现小可爱是个很棒的市场经济学家，她跟卖较多葡萄的人做交易了。她可以给我们的财务学教授上课了。不只是小可爱，大多数的猴子都会跟卖较多葡萄的人做交易。大多数的猴子都会跟有较好食物的人交易。开始与猴子做买卖猴，我们发现猴子会专注在这件事情上。他们会在意猴子币的真正价值。最令人惊讶的是，当我们开始与经济学家合作，使用经济工具分析猴子的数据的时候，不管是在定性研究上，还是在定量研究上，他们的使用方式与我们人类在市场上做的一样。以至于在定量研究中，你根本没法分辨这些数据结果是人类的还是猴子的。
en:So I&#39;ll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.Here&#39;s a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it&#39;s a little short.But here&#39;s Honey.She&#39;s waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.All of a sudden the market opens. Here&#39;s her choice: one grapes or two grapes.You can see Honey, very good market economist,goes with the guy who gives more.She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.So not just Honey,most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.They really cared about their monkey token dollar.The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economiststo actually look at the monkeys&#39; data using economic tools,they basically matched, not just qualitatively,but quantitatively with what we sawhumans doing in a real market.So much so that, if you saw the monkeys&#39; numbers,you couldn&#39;t tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.
时间： 9:34
zh-cn:我们已经成功做到引介给猴子一些东西，至少猴子与我们将代币运作得跟金融货币差不多。另一个问题是：猴子会不会跟我们一样把这个制度搞乱？其实我们也观察到一些现象。第一，在猴子市场中我们没发现到任何储蓄的证据，没发现像我们人一样的储蓄行为。猴子来到市场，会把所有钱花光，然后再跳回猴群里。我们同时也发现另一件事，非常尴尬，就是自发性的盗窃行为。猴子不放过任何机会来偷代币，偷同伴的、偷我们的。这些都是我们不认为介绍给了猴子们的行为，但是我们还是同时看到了这种行为。
en:And what we&#39;d really thought we&#39;d doneis like we&#39;d actually introduced somethingthat, at least for the monkeys and us,works like a real financial currency.Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplacewas any evidence of saving —you know, just like our own species.The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budgetand then went back to everyone else.The other thing we also spontaneously saw,embarrassingly enough,is spontaneous evidence of larceny.The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity —from each other, often from us —you know, things we didn&#39;t necessarily think we were introducing,but things we spontaneously saw.
时间：10:13
zh-cn:这看起来很糟糕。我们是否能够看到猴子们做出跟人类一样愚蠢的事情？有个方法是先创立猴子金融市场，然后再让这个市场停摆，不过，这样做实验可能得等上好几年。我们有点等不及，所以让实验进行得快一点。我们就像，那就让这些小猴子们面对一些问题，这些问题是人类经常会犯错的一些经济议题，或者一些经济方面的实验。想要了解人类是怎么犯错的，最直接的方式就是自己做一次。所以我给大家一个小实验，请各位用你的财务直觉来回答。
en:So we said, this looks bad.Can we actually see if the monkeysare doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?One possibility is just kind of letthe monkey financial system play out,you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.We were a little impatient so we wantedto sort of speed things up a bit.So we said, let&#39;s actually give the monkeysthe same kinds of problemsthat humans tend to get wrongin certain kinds of economic challenges,or certain kinds of economic experiments.And so, since the best way to see how people go wrongis to actually do it yourself,I&#39;m going to give you guys a quick experimentto sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.
时间：10:49
zh-cn:请各位现在想象一下，我给现场每个人各1千美金，10张百元钞票成一捆的1千美金。把它放进你的皮夹里，花点时间想想你要拿这笔钱做什么。这是你的钱，你可以用它买任何想要的东西。捐出去，花掉，怎么都行。听起来不错吧？不过再给你另一个机会，让你能拿1千美金以上的钱。第一种选择：冒险拿多一些，我用丢猴子代币来决定这个选择的结果。如果代币是正面，你可以多得1千美金。如果是背面，那你一分钱都不能多得。有机会拿到比较多，但是要冒点风险。而另一个比较安全的选择：让你再拿一笔确切的金额。不过只能拿500美金。你可以把这笔钱放进皮夹或者马上花掉。你的直觉决定好了吗？大部分的人会选择不冒险的选项。这些人想说，我确定能拿1500美金，干嘛还要去冒险？这似乎是一个不错的选择，我选这个。各位也许觉得这样选没错啊，人是风险趋避者，有问题吗？
en:So imagine that right nowI handed each and every one of youa thousand U.S. dollars — so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.Take these, put it in your walletand spend a second thinking about what you&#39;re going to do with it.Because it&#39;s yours now; you can buy whatever you want.Donate it, take it, and so on.Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.And here&#39;s your choice: you can either be risky,in which case I&#39;m going to flip one of these monkey tokens.If it comes up heads, you&#39;re going to get a thousand dollars more.If it comes up tails, you get nothing.So it&#39;s a chance to get more, but it&#39;s pretty risky.Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.I&#39;m just going to give you 500 bucks.You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.So see what your intuition is here.Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?This seems like a good bet. I&#39;m going to go with that.You might say, eh, that&#39;s not really irrational.People are a little risk-averse. So what?
时间：11:41
zh-cn:人是不是风险趋避者的问题，请思考过另一个类似问题后，再作判断。现在再想象一下，我现在给各位2千美金，20张百元钞票成一捆。你刚刚想买的物品可以多买一倍。想想这笔钱在皮夹里的感觉。现在，选择的一刻又来了，但这次，条件比较糟糕。因为你将决定“失去金钱”的方式，一样要从中做个选择。第一个选择是有风险的损失——一样用丢硬币，如果是正面，你会损失1千美金。如果是反面，你1毛都不用丢，2千美金好好放着。或者可以不冒险，也就是说你乖乖把皮夹拿出来，然后给我5张100元钞票。
en:Well, the &quot;so what?&quot; comes when start thinkingabout the same problemset up just a little bit differently.So now imagine that I give each and every one of you2,000 dollars — 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.Think about how you&#39;d feel sticking it in your wallet.And now imagine that I have you make another choiceBut this time, it&#39;s a little bit worse.Now, you&#39;re going to be deciding how you&#39;re going to lose money,but you&#39;re going to get the same choice.You can either take a risky loss —so I&#39;ll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you&#39;re going to actually lose a lot.If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you&#39;re fine, get to keep the whole thing —or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your walletand give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.
时间：12:19
zh-cn:我看到很多人眉头紧缩哦。测试各位的这个问题，也许各位有着同样直觉的答案，当这些选项摊开给大家选择时，人们不会选安全的方案，而会选择冒险。明明是有着同样选择的2种情境下，后者竟然变得不太理智。拿到1000或2000元的机会各50%，或者100%拿到1500元。而人们对于风险多寡的直觉，居然是来自一开始手上有多少筹码来决定。
en:And I&#39;m seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.So maybe you&#39;re having the same intuitionsas the subjects that were actually tested in this,which is when presented with these options,people don&#39;t choose to play it safe.They actually tend to go a little risky.The reason this is irrational is that we&#39;ve given people in both situationsthe same choice.It&#39;s a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.But people&#39;s intuitions about how much risk to takevaries depending on where they started with.
时间：12:47
zh-cn:这是怎么回事？嗯，这答案来自我们心理层面上的2项偏误。一个是我们没有足够的时间去计算绝对价值。你应该要找时间好好考虑清楚，一个选择是拿1000或2000，一个是拿1500.相反的，如果选项改成相对价值的话，就比较容易理清了。选项改成：“拿到更多”或“拿比较少”。这样的话很好，只不过稍微改变一下手法，就会影响我们对于选项是好是坏的观感。这会引出第二项偏误，经济学家称此为“损失规避”。
en:So what&#39;s going on?Well, it turns out that this seems to be the resultof at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.You really have to do work to figure out,well, one option&#39;s a thousand, 2,000;one is 1,500.Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative termsas options change from one time to another.So we think of things as, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to get more,&quot; or &quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to get less.&quot;This is all well and good, except thatchanges in different directionsactually effect whether or not we thinkoptions are good or not.And this leads to the second bias,which economists have called loss aversion.
时间：13:24
zh-cn:也就是说，我们会非常讨厌任何损失。我们会极度不愿意失去任何金钱。这就意味着我们会转移我们的偏好来避免任何损失。刚刚在第二个情境里面，人们会选择冒险，因为不想放过任何“零损失”的机会。这也点出了我们对于风险的心态——当我们进入“损失规避”模式时，我们会变得更喜欢风险，这就是最令人担心的部分。人类的负面行为也因此而暴露出来。也是为什么股票投资者会死抱着不断下跌的股票，因为他们用相对价值来计算后得到的结论。这也是为什么房市里的投资客不愿意卖掉房子，因为他们不想要房子贬值的时候卖掉。
en:The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.And this means that sometimes we&#39;ll actuallyswitch our preferences to avoid this.What you saw in that last scenario is thatsubjects get riskybecause they want the small shot that there won&#39;t be any loss.That means when we&#39;re in a risk mindset —excuse me, when we&#39;re in a loss mindset,we actually become more risky,which can actually be really worrying.These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.They&#39;re why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer —because they&#39;re evaluating them in relative terms.They&#39;re why people in the housing market refused to sell their house —because they don&#39;t want to sell at a loss.
时间：14:00
zh-cn:我们感兴趣的是猴子们是否也有同样的偏误。若我们在猴子市场里设计同样的问题，他们是否会表现出跟人一样的行为？所以我们让猴子在两个销售员间做选择，一个是安全的交易者，他会一直拿出同样的商品量；另一位是有风险的交易者，他有一半的时间会拿出不同商品。我们提供有红利的选项——就像刚才的第一情境——因此猴子们同样也有机会拿到更多，或者碰到一些损失，实际上他们会觉得自己会拿到比较多的葡萄。
en:The question we were interested inis whether the monkeys show the same biases.If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market,would they do the same thing as people?And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choicesbetween guys who were safe — they did the same thing every time —or guys who were risky —they did things differently half the time.And then we gave them options that were bonuses —like you guys did in the first scenario —so they actually have a chance more,or pieces where they were experiencing losses —they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.

zh-cn:这是实验的情景。我们将2为新的销售员介绍给猴子们。左边和右边一开始都是拿出1粒葡萄，看起来很公平。但是这2位会给猴子们一些红利。左边提供的是安全红利。从头到尾，他会多给猴子1粒葡萄。右边的是提供风险红利。有时候猴子拿不到任何红利，所以他不会多拿任何葡萄。但有时候猴子能多拿2粒葡萄。很棒的红利，所以猴子能一次拿3粒葡萄。这跟刚刚给各位的实验内容是一样的。那么，猴子是会去选择有安全红利的交易，就是那位每次交易都会提供同样东西的人；或者，他们会去选有风险的红利。虽然要冒点险，有可能拿不到任何红利，但是如果能拿到就赚翻了。人类倾向选择安全的做法。结果，没想到猴子也会选择安全的一方。在定性和定量研究里，在同样的测试内容中，猴子与人类有一致的行为反应。
en:And so this is what this looks like.We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape,so it looks pretty good.But they&#39;re going to give the monkeys bonuses.The guy on the left is a safe bonus.All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus — so this is a bonus of zero.Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.For a big bonus, now they get three.But this is the same choice you guys just faced.Do the monkeys actually want to play it safeand then go with the guy who&#39;s going to do the same thing on every trial,or do they want to be riskyand try to get a risky, but big, bonus,but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.People here played it safe.Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.Qualitatively and quantitatively,they choose exactly the same way as people,when tested in the same thing.

zh-cn:各位也许会觉得，可能是因为猴子不喜欢冒险。那么让我们来看看猴子面对损失时的行为。于是我们就做了第二个版本的实验。现在，猴子们会面对这两个销售员，他们不会再给猴子红利了；他们会拿走猴子们预期的葡萄数。所以他们一开始就拿出较多的葡萄。一开始就拿出3粒葡萄：这是猴子最想看到的情形。不过他们发现，这两个家伙会给比预期少的数量。左边这位，他提供固定的损失量。每次他都会固定少给猴子一粒葡萄，也就是只给他们2粒。右边这位提供有风险的损失量。有时候一个都不会少，完全符合猴子预期，但有时候他会拿走更多，也就是只给猴子一粒葡萄。
en:You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don&#39;t like risk.Maybe we should see how they do with losses.And so we ran a second version of this.Now, the monkeys meet two guyswho aren&#39;t giving them bonuses;they&#39;re actually giving them less than they expect.So they look like they&#39;re starting out with a big amount.These are three grapes; the monkey&#39;s really psyched for this.But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.They guy on the left is a safe loss.Every single time, he&#39;s going to take one of these awayand give the monkeys just two.the guy on the right is the risky loss.Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched,but sometimes he actually gives a big loss,taking away two to give the monkeys only one.

zh-cn:猴子们会怎么决定？和刚才一样，他们可以做保险的交易，每次交易都拿固定的2粒葡萄，或者做有风险的交易，拿1粒或者3粒。最让我们关注的是，当猴子们面对这个选择时，他们表现出跟人类一样的非理性行为。根据实验的起始条件，猴子们变得倾向冒险。这真是太不可思议了，因为猴子居然也用相对价值来评估，而且在面对损失和面对收获时有着非常不同的行为。
en:And so what do the monkeys do?Again, same choice; they can play it safefor always getting two grapes every single time,or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice,they do the same irrational thing that people do.They actually become more riskydepending on how the experimenters started.This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys tooare evaluating things in relative termsand actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.

zh-cn:这给我们什么启示？我们先做归纳。首先，我们给猴子一种财务货币，然后教它们一些简单的交易行为，它们会做出跟人类一样聪明的事情，也会做跟人类一样不太好的事情，比如偷钱之类的。同事它们也会做出跟人类一样非理性的行为。它们有条理地做出错误行为，跟我们如出一辙。今天我想给各位的第一个结论，如果你只听到开头的部分，你可能会想——我回家后真该雇佣一只卷尾猴当我的财务大臣。这家伙的可爱程度超过家里的那位。。。但你可千万别这么做，因为这些猴子的糊涂程度跟你家里的那位差不多。这有点遗憾。各位听我说，请猴子来当投资客不太好。
en:So what does all of this mean?Well, what we&#39;ve shown is that, first of all,we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency,and they do very similar things with it.They do some of the smart things we do,some of the kind of not so nice things we do,like steal it and so on.But they also do some of the irrational things we do.They systematically get things wrongand in the same ways that we do.This is the first take-home message of the Talk,which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought,oh, I&#39;m totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.They&#39;re way cuter than the one at ... you know —Don&#39;t do that; they&#39;re probably going to be just as dumbas the human one you already have.So, you know, a little bad — Sorry, sorry, sorry.A little bad for monkey investors.

zh-cn:当然，偷笑的各位也觉得人一样不善于当投资客。这问题的答案在刚才就已经证明给大家看了。而我们为了想了解这些错误从何而来，就抱着某些希望，像是在某种程度上调整我们的金融机构，或调整我们的财务方法让自己过得更好。但我们已经了解到其实这两种偏误已经深深地影响了我们。事实上，这些偏误之所以会影响我们这么深，是因为它们老早就深植在我们的进化过程中。各位，也许笨蛋不只是图中这进化链中最右边的人类，也许变笨蛋的来源是从古早就有了。如果我们相信这些针对猴子的实验结果，也就表示我们承认这种愚蠢对策，早在3500万年前就出现了。这存在已久的对策已经默默地影响我们很久。
en:But of course, you know, the reason you&#39;re laughing is bad for humans too.Because we&#39;ve answered the question we started out with.We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.And we started with the hope that maybe we cansort of tweak our financial institutions,tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.But what we&#39;ve learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.In fact, they might be due to the very natureof our evolutionary history.You know, maybe it&#39;s not just humansat the right side of this chain that&#39;s duncey.Maybe it&#39;s sort of duncey all the way back.And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results,means that these duncey strategiesmight be 35 million years old.That&#39;s a long time for a strategyto potentially get changed around — really, really old.

zh-cn:我们对这类的对策了解多少？我们了解的其中一个事实就是，我们很难去改变它。想一想我们最先进化的部分就是懂得吃甜食、高脂肪的食物，如芝士蛋糕。你没办法闭嘴不吃。你没办法对着装满推车的点心说：“我才不吃，这些令我作呕。”但人与人之间存在着差异性。我们会追求自己认为好的事物。所以我推测人们对于财务上的决策也会有不同的认知见解。你会傻愣愣地看持有的股票价格直线下降，或者看着自己持有的不动产贬值，而你不会去注意到事情的真相，因为我们与生俱来就是有这样的行为。这种心理上的偏差会让投资者做出糟糕的决定，所以像这次的次贷危机就变得很难去避免。
en:What do we know about other old strategies like this?Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.You know, think of our evolutionary predilectionfor eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.You can&#39;t just shut that off.You can&#39;t just look at the dessert cart as say, &quot;No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me.&quot;We&#39;re just built differently.We&#39;re going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.My guess is that the same thing is going to be truewhen humans are perceivingdifferent financial decisions.When you&#39;re watching your stocks plummet into the red,when you&#39;re watching your house price go down,you&#39;re not going to be able to see thatin anything but old evolutionary terms.This means that the biasesthat lead investors to do badly,that lead to the foreclosure crisisare going to be really hard to overcome.

zh-cn:听起来都是坏消息，哪有没有好消息呢？我这里是有一些好消息告诉各位。我想这个好消息就是，就如同我在今天开头时所说，人类不只是聪明而已；我们比起生物界里的其它动物，都要聪明许多。我们非常擅长克服我们先天上的不足——就像我是搭飞机来这里，我不需要把手当翅膀拍动来飞。我带着隐形眼镜就能看清楚各位，不需要依赖我这双大近视的眼睛。我们有这么多例子都是用科技或其它方式来突破我们生物限制的事实，让一切看起来是这么简单。但我们也必须了解自己的极限在哪里，
en:So that&#39;s the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?I&#39;m supposed to be up here telling you the good news.Well, the good news, I think,is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk,which is that humans are not only smart;we&#39;re really inspirationally smartto the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.We&#39;re so good at overcoming our biological limitations —you know, I flew over here in an airplane.I didn&#39;t have to try to flap my wings.I&#39;m wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.I don&#39;t have to rely on my own near-sightedness.We actually have all of these caseswhere we overcome our biological limitationsthrough technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.
时间：18:56
zh-cn:而这是最难的地方。就像卡谬曾说，“人是唯一搞不清楚自己是什么的物种。”讽刺的是我们得知道人类的极限在哪儿，才能克服它们。希望各位都能意识到自己的极限在哪儿，它并不是不可逾越的，了解它，接受它，然后发展出让世人更了解人类极限的工具。想要能激发出人类潜力，同时成为那种我们心里想成为的高贵物种，这也许是唯一的办法。
en:And here&#39;s the rub.It was Camus who once said that, &quot;Man is the only specieswho refuses to be what he really is.&quot;But the irony is thatit might only be in recognizing our limitationsthat we can really actually overcome them.The hope is that you all will think about your limitations,not necessarily as unovercomable,but to recognize them, accept themand then use the world of design to actually figure them out.That might be the only way that we will really be ableto achieve our own human potentialand really be the noble species we hope to all be.
