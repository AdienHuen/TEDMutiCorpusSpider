zh-cn:为什么飞行汽车让我们痴迷？一百年前我们就开始想建造它回望历史有不少尝试技术上有了一定进展但今天我们仍然没能坐上飞行汽车（如果成功的话）各位早上来的路上就能够感受到它会将我们熟悉的二维世界和头顶的三维天空天衣无缝地融为一体－不知道各位怎么想，但我真的是乐在其中
en:What is it about flying cars?We&#39;ve wanted to do this for about a hundred years.And there are historic attemptsthat have had some level of technical success.But we haven&#39;t yet gotten to the pointwhere on your way here this morningyou see something that really, truly seamlessly integratesthe two-dimensional world that we&#39;re comfortable inwith the three-dimensional sky above us —that, I don&#39;t know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in.

zh-cn:我们回顾了以往的尝试发现尽管事实上今天我们有许多的现代化创新在以前是没有的－我们有现代复合材料，有无可比拟的省油且超大输出功率的飞机引擎我们有玻璃的座舱电子设备提供飞行信息坐在驾驶舱就可以一揽全局－但不从其它视角来探索根本性问题的话我们得到的结果与近一百年来这些人的结果将没什么两样我们可不想这样于是我们觉得与其要汽车上天不如让飞机下地
en:We looked at the historical attempts that had been out thereand realized that, despite the factthat we have a lot of modern innovationsto draw on todaythat weren&#39;t available previously —we have modern composite materials,we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economyand have better power-to-rate ratios than have ever been available,we have glass cockpit avionicsthat bring the information you need to flydirectly to you in the cockpit —but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective,we realized that we were going to be gettingthe same result that people had been gettingfor the last hundred years,which isn&#39;t where we want to be right now.So instead of trying to make a car that can fly,we decided to try to make a plane that could drive.

zh-cn:这就是Terrafugia陆空两用飞车它是一个两座、单引擎飞机就像其他小型飞机一样在机场起降一旦着陆后就可以把机翅叠起来 开回家停在车库里它非常好使！经过两年的研发与制作终于在2008年面世了
en:And the result is the Terrafugia Transition.It&#39;s a two-seat, single-engine airplanethat works just like any other small airplane.You take off and land at a local airport.Then once you&#39;re on the ground,you fold up the wings, drive it home,park it in your garage.And it works.After two years of an innovative design and construction process,the proof of concept made its public debutin 2008.

zh-cn:就像所有横空出世的东西一样测试并不是一路顺风但是这也不完全是坏事当你一直搞不定一个问题的时候你会学到很多比起一次就成功的会学会很多尽管如此我们一直期待它能按计划早日升空第三次高速试飞是一个寒风刺骨的早晨在纽约州北部那一次没有办法我身后的照片是僚机上的副驾驶捕捉到的镜头就是飞机腾空而起后的瞬间看到那一幕我们都无比兴奋这象征着成就了一项世人以为不可能完成的任务
en:Now like with anythingthat&#39;s really different from the status quo,it didn&#39;t always go so well testing that aircraft.And we discovered that it&#39;s a very good thingthat, when you go home with something that&#39;s been broken,you&#39;ve actually learned a lot morethan when you managed to tick off all of your test objectivesthe first time through.Still, we very much wanted to seethe aircraft that we&#39;d all helped buildin the air, off the ground,like it was supposed to be.And on our third high-speed testing deploymenton a bitter cold morning in upstate New York,we got to do that for the first time.The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraftjust moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time.And we were all very flattered to see that imagebecome a symbol of accomplishing somethingthat people had thought was impossiblereally the world over.

zh-cn:后续的测试较之简单而安全但要把项目向前推进就必须完成这些才能获得来自最终我们的市场－飞行界和监管机构－特别是负责美国境内的使用和设计飞行器的机构的信任大约一年前 美国联邦航空总署给了我们一个特许证允许我们的飞车超重110磅仍可列在轻航机的种类下这听起来没什么 但其实很重要因为只要它符合轻航机的规定发放执照就容易些也更加方便学员掌握驾驶技术轻航机的驾驶执照只需要20小时的飞行时数而额外的110磅对我们解决另一个问题非常重要－驾驶
en:The flight testing that followed thatwas as basic and low-risk as we could make it,but it still accomplished what we needed toto take the program to the next stepand to gain the credibility that we neededwithin our eventual market, the general aviation community,and with the regulatorsthat govern the use of design of aircraft, particularly in the States.The FAA, about a year ago,gave us an exemption for the Transitionto allow us to have an additional 110 lbs.within the light sport aircraft category.Now that doesn&#39;t sound like a lot, but it&#39;s very important,because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraftmakes it simpler for us to certify it,but it also makes it much easierfor you to learn how to fly it.A sport pilot can be certificatedin as little as 20 hours of flight time.And at 110 lbs.,that&#39;s very important for solving the other side of the equation —driving.

zh-cn:我们发现驾驶的设计细则和规定比飞行还复杂这对我们一辈子生活在地上的人是有点异想天开，开车会碰上坑洞，石子行人，其它车辆还有一大堆政府对机动车辆安全的规定要遵守所幸 需求是发明之母许多应用在飞机上的高明设计正好能够解决陆地行驶的特定问题－数不胜数的例子 比如无段自动变速器液态冷却系统能让飞机引擎在时走时停的路上应付自如还有专用定制变速箱对飞行所用的螺旋桨和驾驶所用的车轮能双管齐下还有稍后能看到的折叠式机翼和安全设计它有一个碳纤维安全机舱能确保乘客安全而重量比传统钢材汽车要轻百分之十
en:It turns out that driving,with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles,is actually a harder problem to solve than flying.For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground,this may be counter-intuitive,but driving has potholes, cobblestones,pedestrians, other driversand a rather long and detailed listof federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with.Fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention,and a lot of the design workthat we&#39;re the most proud of with the aircraftcame out of solving the unique problemsof operating it on the ground —everything from a continuously-variable transmissionand liquid-based cooling systemthat allows us to use an aircraft enginein stop-and-go traffic,to a custom-designed gearboxthat powers either the propeller when you&#39;re flying or the wheels on the ground,to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we&#39;ll see in a moment,to crash safety features.We have a carbon fiber safety cagethat protects the occupantsfor less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car.

zh-cn:这听上去不简单了 不过还不够好陆地交通的相关规定从来没涉及到飞机上去所以我们需要美国国家公路交通安全管理局的协助最近的新闻也许能看到大概是上个月底我们获得了几项豁免陆空两用飞车可以在运动休旅车和小型货车的分类下上市销售因为是多功能客运工具因此号称是“非常规越野用途的设计”
en:Now this also, as good as it is, wasn&#39;t quite enough.The regulations for vehicles on the roadweren&#39;t written with an airplane in mind.So we did need a little bit of supportfrom the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Now you may have seen in the news recently,they came through with us at the end of last monthwith a few special exemptionsthat will allow the Transition to be soldin the same category as SUVs and light trucks.As a multi-purpose passenger vehicle,it is now officially &quot;designed for occasional off-road use.&quot;

zh-cn:现在让我们来看看实况它的机翼折起收在机身两侧引擎推动的不是螺旋桨而是车轮不到七尺高这样就能开进标准车库这是机翼自动收展装置这是实时的只要按下驾驶员座舱边的几个按钮 机翼就展开来全部展开后有一个机械锁定装置能将其固定这是在驾驶舱内操作的然后就可以象其它飞机一样进行操作了－就像把敞篷车车顶放下来一样要是你们邻居看了不知道是什么反应呢
en:Now let&#39;s see it in action.You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane.You&#39;re not powering the propeller, you&#39;re powering the wheels.And it is under seven feet tall,so it will fit in a standard construction garage.And that&#39;s the automated wing-folding mechanism.That&#39;s real time.You just push a few buttons in the cockpit, and the wings come out.Once they&#39;re fully deployed,there&#39;s a mechanical lock that goes into place,again, from inside the cockpit.And they&#39;re now fully capable of handlingany of the loads you would see in flight —just like putting down your convertible top.And you&#39;re all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.

zh-cn:我们都为这个“超级跳”而兴奋得难以自已而我们的试飞员给出了前所未有的对试飞的评价他说是“非同寻常地毫无意外”他又告诉我们这个陆空两用飞车是他30年试飞生涯里降落操作最容易的机种我们不仅仅想创造革命性的产品更想尽可能得创造先进创新的东西我们采用了大量的最尖端前沿的航空和汽车竞技技术而真正突破的是我们使用了递增式概念，设计，建造，测试，再设计的循环方法得以在起步就减少了风险
en:AMD: See, we&#39;re all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop.And our test pilot gave usthe best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight,which was that it was &quot;remarkably unremarkable.&quot;He would go onto tell usthat the Transition had been the easiest airplane to landthat he&#39;d flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot.So despite making somethingthat is seemingly revolutionary,we really focused on doingas little new as possible.We leverage a lot of technology from the state-of-the-art in general aviationand from automotive racing.When we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box,we use an incremental design, build, test, redesign cyclethat lets us reduce risk in baby steps.

zh-cn:我们是从六年前开始Terrafugia的设计就是这样一步一个脚印走来我们三个人从还是研究生的时候就在麻省理工的地下室里钻研到现在有二十多人在波士顿郊区的一个工厂里进行开发我们必须得克服各种挑战比如我提到的轻航机的重量限制还有怎样不失礼貌地回答监管单位的官员的问题“可是要是机翼不收起来就过不来收费站啊”（笑声）还有许多许多刚才提及的耐用性和地面机械工程的问题只要目前我们正在做的两个生产机型的测试和制造都一切顺利的话头一批到目前为止大约一百台的订单明年年底就能出货了
en:Now since we started Terrafugia about 6 years ago,we&#39;ve had a lot of those baby steps.We&#39;ve gone from being three of usworking in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate schoolto about two-dozen of usworking in an initial production facility outside of Boston.We&#39;ve had to overcome challengeslike keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about,figuring out how to politely respondwhen a regulator tells you,&quot;But that won&#39;t fit through a toll booth with the wings extended —(Laughter)to all of the other associated durability and engineering issuesthat we talked about on the ground.Still, if everything goes to our satisfactionwith the testing and constructionof the two production prototypesthat we&#39;re working on right now,those first deliveriesto the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane at this pointshould begin at the end of next year.

zh-cn:这种陆空两用飞车和其它轻航机价格相差无已当然我不是说要你换掉家里雪弗莱不过我认为它应该是你下一架飞机原因就是目前全球的商用航线都集中在少数几个大型航空港很多资源没有被好好利用上千条地区性飞机跑道使用率非常低在美国 平均方圆二十到三十公里就有一个这个陆空两用飞车能为你提供一个安全便捷和有趣的途径来利用这些资源
en:The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes.And I&#39;m certainly not out to replace your Chevy,but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane.Here&#39;s why.While nearly all of the commercial air travel in the worldgoes through a relatively small number of large hub airports,there is a huge underutilized resource out there.There are thousands of local airstripsthat don&#39;t see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could.On average, there&#39;s one within 20 to 30 milesof wherever you are in the United States.The Transition gives youa safer, more convenient and more fun wayof using this resource.

zh-cn:对于还不懂飞行的人来说无非是四个原因让他们不能想飞就飞：首先是天气费用，及门旅运时间长还有达到目的地后交通问题那么现在碰上坏天气降落 收起机翼直接开回家下点雨也不是问题，反正有雨刷也不同花钱租停机坪停在自己车库就是我们用的油就是一般的无铅汽油比起航空用油便宜又环保及门旅运时间也减少了因为不用装行李，找停泊位脱鞋检查，把飞机从停机坪开出来那么一大阵功夫你就能开到目的地了而目的地交通问题也解决了只要收起机翼继续开就好了
en:For those of you who aren&#39;t yet pilots,there&#39;s four main reasons why those of us who aredon&#39;t fly as much as we&#39;d like to:the weather, primarily,cost, long door-to-door travel timeand mobility at your destination.Now, bad weather comes in,just land, fold up the wings, drive home.Doesn&#39;t matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger,park it in your garage.And the unleaded automotive fuel that we useis both cheaper and better for the environmentthan traditional avgas.Door-to-door travel time is reduced,because now, instead of lugging bags, finding a parking space,taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger,you&#39;re now just spending that time getting to where you want to go.And mobility to your destination is clearly solved.Just fold up the wings and keep going.

zh-cn:这个陆空两用飞车拓展了我们的视野让世界更小更触手可及也让生活充满探险希望你们每个人利用一点时间想一下你能怎样利用它让你自己拥抱更广阔的世界让每一次旅行都便捷而愉快
en:The Transition simultaneously expands our horizonswhile making the world a smaller, more accessible place.It also continues to be a fabulous adventure.I hope you&#39;ll each take a momentto think about how you could use something like thisto give yourself more access to your own world,and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun.
