en:This is in Venice.I just show it because I want you to knowI&#39;m concerned about context.On the left-hand side,I had the context of those little houses,and I tried to build a building that fit into that context.When people take pictures of these buildings out of that contextthey look really weird,and my premise is that they make a lot more sensewhen they&#39;re photographed or seen in that space.And then, once I deal with the context,I then try to make a place that&#39;s comfortable and private and fairly serene,as I hope you&#39;ll find that slide on the right.

en:And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.I was concerned about making a place for the study of law.And we continue to work with this client.The building on the right at the top is now under construction.The garage on the right — the gray structure — will be torn down,finally, and several small classrooms will be placedalong this avenue that we&#39;ve created, this campus.And it all related to the clients and the studentsfrom the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.They wanted a sense of place.And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of spacein downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.And it was my theory, or my point of view,that one didn&#39;t upstage the neighborhood —one made accommodations.I tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood,whether they were buildings I liked or not.

en:I mean, the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism — at po-mo —and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man,and if you&#39;re going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning.And so I started making these funny things.And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger —as the one glass at the Walker.And then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everythingand tried to translate what I was learningabout the form of the fish and the movement.And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it —accidental, again —it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it,and made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal.

en:Now, it&#39;s hard to do. It&#39;s hard to translate a fish form,because they&#39;re so beautiful — perfect —into a building or object like this.And Oldenburg, who I work with a little once in a while,told me I couldn&#39;t do it, and so that made it even more exciting.But he was right — I couldn&#39;t do the tail.I started to get the head OK, but the tail I couldn&#39;t do.It was pretty hard.The thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.And I put them together, and you walk between them.It was a dialog with the context again.Now, if you saw a picture of thisas it was published in Architectural Record —they didn&#39;t show the context, so you would think,&quot;God, what a pushy guy this is.&quot;But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around herelooking for this restaurant.Couldn&#39;t find it.So ...

en:As for craft and technology and all those thingsthat you&#39;ve all been talking about, I was thrown for a complete loop.This was built in six months.The way we sent drawings to Japan:we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models,and we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.We made the drawings of the fish and the scales.And when I got there, everything was perfect —except the tail.So, I decided to cut off the head and the tail.

en:And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker.And it&#39;s one of the nicest pieces I&#39;ve ever made, I think.And then Jay Chiat, a friend and client,asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.For reasons we don&#39;t want to talk about, it got delayed.Toxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one.And so we built a temporary building — I&#39;m getting good at temporary —and we put a conference room in that&#39;s a fish.

en:I use a lot of metal in my work,and I have a hard time connecting with the craft.The whole thing about my house,the whole use of rough carpentry and everything,was the frustration with the crafts available.I said, &quot;If I can&#39;t get the craft that I want,I&#39;ll use the craft I can get.&quot;There were plenty of models for that,in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artistswho were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.I went into the metal because it was a way of building a buildingthat was a sculpture.And it was all of one material,and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.The metalworkers, for the most part,do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff.I was given an opportunity to design an exhibitfor the metalworkers&#39; unions of America and Canada in Washington,and I did it on the condition that they become my partnersin the future and help me with all future metal buildings, etc. etc.And it&#39;s working very wellto have these people, these craftsmen, interested in it.I just tell the stories.It&#39;s a way of connecting, at least, with some of those peoplethat are so important to the realization of architecture.

en:You drive down.So it&#39;s about a 10-story C-clamp.And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum,and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.And this would be a hotel.So, the centerline of this thing — we&#39;d preserve it,and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildingsby Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.It&#39;s hard to do high-rise.I feel much more comfortable down here.

zh-cn:这是在Brentwood的一块地这是很老的项目了，大概是82年的样子在我给自己设计的住宅之后设计的一座住宅由一个庭院和它周围的几个阁楼组成的村子这片土地的业主曾为我工作制作了左边的这个实物模型后来她找到我我猜是发财了还是怎么的然后她让我给这片地设计一座住宅我们延续了村落的基本概念并在深入的过程中作了改变通过切削背（左）面的体量，我把整个建筑卡在场地里你在这张照片里看到的场地穿插进建筑里，然后把浴室和化妆间布置在里面起挡土墙的作用，在底层给主卧室创造了一个分区设计得像艘货船像艘船就是这样，建成了穹顶是客户的要求她要住宅里某处有个穹顶她才不管在哪处如果你在这卧室里睡觉，我希望我的意思是，我没在里面睡过我为了在那睡一觉向她提过亲但她说我不用这样但是当你在那个卧室里你感觉多少有点像在一艘湖上的船里很私密的空间周围布置了景观来营造一个私家花园而在上面，起居室的这边有一个花园还有一个在另一面
en:This is a piece of property in Brentwood.And a long time ago, about &#39;82 or something, after my house —I designed a house for myselfthat would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard —and the owner of this lot worked for meand built that actual model on the left.And she came back,I guess wealthier or something — something happened —and asked me to design a house for her on this site.And following that basic idea of the village,we changed it as we got into it.I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end —here you see on the photographs of the site —slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing roomslike a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom,which I designed like a kind of a barge,looking like a boat.And that&#39;s it, built.The dome was a request from the client.She wanted a dome somewhere in the house.She didn&#39;t care where.When you sleep in this bedroom, I hope —I mean, I haven&#39;t slept in it yet.I&#39;ve offered to marry her so I could sleep there,but she said I didn&#39;t have to do that.But when you&#39;re in that room,you feel like you&#39;re on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.And it&#39;s very private.The landscape is being built around to create a private garden.And then up above there&#39;s a garden on this side of the living room,and one on the other side.

zh-cn:好了，你进入一个有美丽树丛的花园这是起居室佣人的房间一个客房，有大理石吊顶的穹顶然后你进入起居室，诸如此类这是卧室你从这层经由楼梯下来然后你进入卧室，然后是湖而床在这个空间后面有向湖的窗子这些像石门一样的东西被设计成前景并在这个进深不大的场地里创造更好的进深感用的材料是铅铜，和之前波士顿的建筑相似所以我们的意图是让这一小片土地100英尺宽250英尺长，变成一个大庄园方法就是分割区域以及将卧室和餐厅放进空间较高的阁楼里我无意地把开窗与餐桌放在了一条轴线上看出去像是我搞到了一幅免费的Baldessari油画我的概念是，开窗的布置让你可以看到外面住宅的一部分最终形成框景 — 树会长高而形成一个很私密的空间你觉得有点像在你自己的村落里
en:Anyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees.That&#39;s the living room.Servants&#39; quarters.A guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.And then you enter into the living room and then so on.This is the bedroom.You come down from this level along the stairway,and you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.And the bed is back in this space,with windows looking out onto the lake.These Stonehenge things were designed to give foregroundand to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land —it&#39;s 100 by 250 — into a kind of an estate by separating these areasand making the living room and dining room into this pavilionwith a high space in it.And this happened by accident that I got this right on axiswith the dining room table.It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.But the idea is, the windows are all placedso you see pieces of the house outside.Eventually this will be screened — these trees will come up —and it will be very private.And you feel like you&#39;re in your own kind of village.

en:I&#39;m doing a building in Switzerland, Basel,which is an office building for a furniture company.And we struggled with the image.These are the early studies, but they have to sell furnitureto normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy,then people might say, &quot;Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing,but no, it ain&#39;t going to look good in my normal building.&quot;So we&#39;ve made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here,and we&#39;ve taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of themso that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.And you&#39;re looking at it from the offices and you create a kind ofinteraction between these pieces.

en:These are the models for it.I showed you the other model, the one —this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing —so I understood the problem.I was trying to get around this plan coupe — how do you do it?Apartments, etc.And these are the kind of study models we did.And the one on the left is pretty awful.You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.But out of it came finally this resolution, where the elevator pieceworked frontally to this, parallel to this street,and also parallel to here.And then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt,kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer.The restaurants here — the apartments and the theater, etc.So it would all be built in stone, in French limestone,except for this metal piece.And it faces into a park.And the idea was to make this express the energy of this.On the side facing the street it&#39;s much more normal,except I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point,these housing units made a gesture to the corner.And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard.If any of you guys have any ideas for it, please contact me.I don&#39;t know what to do.

en:This is the Disney Hall — the concert hall.It&#39;s a complicated project.It has a chamber hall.It&#39;s related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was builtwith a lot of love and tears and caring.And it&#39;s not a great building, but I approached it optimistically,that we would make a compositional relationship between usthat would strengthen both of us.And the plan of this — it&#39;s a concert hall.This is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.There&#39;s commercial at the ground floor.These are offices, which, really, in the competition,we didn&#39;t have to design.But finally, there&#39;s a hotel there.These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler,composing these elevations together and relating themto the buildings that existed — to MOCA, etc.

zh-cn:我们根据声学专家给我们列出标准设计了这个分割体量的方案赢得竞赛之后我们发现这个方案根本行不通但是大家都喜欢这个形式和它的空间这就是竞赛的麻烦你非得想办法让你的方案实现我们做了很多研究模型这是我们最初的模型这是声学上比较理想的三个建筑阿姆斯特丹的Concertgebouw音乐厅，波士顿音乐厅和柏林音乐厅大家都喜欢里面的环绕音效实际上这是尺度最小的一个音乐厅但是它设置的作为比其他几个都多因为它设置了双层看台我们的客户不喜欢看台而当我们和新的升学专家碰头时他告诉我这个形状很合适，那个形状很合适我们尝试了很多形状，想把最初方案的精神通过一个声学上可以接受的形式来实现最终我们决定了这个形状采用Concertgebouw音乐厅的比例设置倾斜的外墙，声学专家说这个至关重要后来又说其实无关紧要但反正我们是做了
en:The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria,which led to this compartmentalized scheme,which we found out after the competition would not work at all.But everybody liked these forms and liked the space,and so that&#39;s one of the problems of a competition.You have to then try and get that back in some way.And we studied many models.This was our original model.These were the three buildings that were the ideal —the Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.Everybody liked the surround.Actually, this is the smallest hall in size,and it has more seats than any of thesebecause it has double balconies.Our client doesn&#39;t want balconies, so —and when we met our new acoustician, he told usthis was the right shape or this was the right shape.And we tried many shapes, trying to get the energyof the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format.We finally settled on a shape that wasthe proportion of the Concertgebouwwith the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician saidwere crucial to this and later decided they weren&#39;t,but now we have them.

en:And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculpturaland out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.That&#39;s the idea.And the corners would have skylightsand these columns would be structural.And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you akind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit,and create intimacy.Now, this is not a final design — these are just on the way to being —and so I wouldn&#39;t take it literally, except the feeling of the space.We studied the acoustics with laser stuff,and they bounce them off this and see where it all works.But you get the sense of the hall in section.Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.In this case we&#39;re opening it back upand getting skylights in the four corners.And so it will be quite a different shape.

en:In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish, and we&#39;re working on that,at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done bySkidmore, Owings and Merrill.And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel,non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it,perverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind ofa 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit —this is the beach and the harbor out in front,and this is really a shopping center with department stores.And we split these bridges.Originally, this was all solid with a hole in it.We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind ofa foreground for this hotel.We showed this to the hotel people the other day,and they were terrified and said that nobody would cometo the Ritz-Carlton anymore, because of this fish.
