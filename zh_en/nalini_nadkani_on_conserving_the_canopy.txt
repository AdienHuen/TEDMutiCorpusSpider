zh-cn:树木是一片有趣的值得探索的领域因为树木挺拔，结构也复杂它们培育了生物多样性，它们宁静又美丽我过去常常以爬树为乐现在长大了，我从事的专业是去了解树木和树林，通过科学的方法
en:Trees are wonderful arenas for discoverybecause of their tall stature, their complex structure,the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.I used to climb trees for fun all the timeand now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding treesand forests, through the medium of science.

zh-cn:树林最神秘的地方是树的树冠部分在1983年，特里.欧文称林冠为“最后的生物防线”我会带你们进入到森林的林冠与你们分享林冠研究人员在探索的东西以及他们是如何与这个领域外的人交流的
en:The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.And Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983,called the canopy, &quot;the last biotic frontier.&quot;I&#39;d like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy,and share with you what canopy researchers are askingand also how they&#39;re communicating with other people outside of science.

zh-cn:让我们从树林底层开始这是我在哥斯达黎加的一个研究基地由于树叶和树枝四处展开你会发现下层植被很暗也很安静我想要做的是带你们到林冠部分不用绳索和吊带把你们带上去而是给你们看一个短片来自国家地理频道的短片叫：雨林林冠的探险家这是在哥斯达黎加的蒙特威尔特（一个森林保护区）拍摄的我觉得这可以让我们更好的经历爬上巨大勒颈无花果树（一种热带树种）的感觉音乐吼叫声沙沙声
en:Let&#39;s start our journey on the forest floorof one of my study sites in Costa Rica.Because of the overhanging leaves and branches,you&#39;ll notice that the understory is very dark,it&#39;s very still.And what I&#39;d like to do is take you up to the canopy,not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses,but rather showing you a very short clipfrom a National Geographic film called &quot;Heroes of the High Frontier.&quot;This was filmed in Monteverde, Costa Ricaand I think it gives us the best impression of what it&#39;s liketo climb a giant strangler fig.(Music)(Growling)(Rustling)

zh-cn:你可以看到的是林的上端的确很像一块开阔的场地有很多植物和动物适应了林冠的生活，并一直生活在那里有相同特征的动物，如树獭，可以很容易适应林冠的生活，用强有力的爪子抓住树不放但我想告诉你们一种不易察觉的生物多样性那就是蚂蚁世上有1万种蚂蚁被描述动物并给动物取名的分类学者取名其中4千种蚂蚁只生活在林冠中
en:So what you&#39;ll see up there is that it&#39;s really like the atmosphere of an open field,and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adaptedto make their way and their life in the canopy.Common groups, like the sloth here, have clear adaptationsfor forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws.But I&#39;d like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversityand tell you about the ants.There are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists —people who describe and name animals — have named.4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy.
时间： 2:39
zh-cn:我拿蚂蚁举例的其中一个原因是我的丈夫其实是一位蚂蚁分类学者我们结婚后，他许诺我用我的名字给一种蚂蚁取名Procyptocerus nalini, 一种林冠蚂蚁我们有两个孩子，奥格斯特安德鲁和埃丽卡其实他也用他们的名字给蚂蚁取了名我们可能是唯一一个用自己的名字给蚂蚁取名的家庭
en:One of the reasons I tell you about antsis because of my husband, who is in fact an ant taxonomistand when we got married, he promised to name an ant after me, which he did —Procryptocerus nalini, a canopy ant.We&#39;ve had two children, August Andrew and Erikaand actually, he named ants after them.So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us.

zh-cn:但我关注的，除了杰克和我的孩子是这些植物，所谓的附生植物这些植物长在树上它们没有长在树枝上或丛林地表的根但他们的叶子能够截留以薄雾形式出现的已溶解的营养物这些植物的种类很多世界上大约有两万八千种它们生长在这样的热带丛林里它们也生长在温带雨林里，我们在华盛顿州可以发现这些
en:But my passion — in addition to Jack and my children —are the plants, the so-called epiphytes,those plants that grow up on trees.They don&#39;t have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor.But rather, it is their leaves that are adaptedto intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog.These plants occur in great diversity,over 28,000 species around the world.They grow in tropical forests like this oneand they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state.
时间： 3:31
zh-cn:这些附生植物大多是藓类有一件事我要说明的是在这些活的附生植物下面当这些植物死去并分解，它们变成了树上的土壤温带和热带地区都有这种现象这些由分解而产生的藓类大多数是和你们院子里的泥苔藓一样它们有很强的能力锁住营养和水分
en:These epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses.One thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes,as they die and decompose, they actually construct an arboreal soil,both in the temperate zone and in the tropics.And these mosses, generated by decomposing,are like peat moss in your garden.They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water.
时间： 3:54
zh-cn:我发现一件很奇怪的事如果我们回去看这些苔藓群在它们下面我们可以找到一些联系和网络我们称之为林冠的根这些不是附生植物的根这些是主体树的树干和树枝的根所以那些附生植物其实是在支付地主（主体树）租金以便能够生活在丛林地表高处
en:One of the surprising things I discoveredis that, if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes,what you&#39;ll find underneath them are connections, networksof what we call canopy roots.These are not epiphyte roots:these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves.And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rentin exchange for being supported high above the forest floor.
时间： 4:19
zh-cn:我和我的同事都感兴趣的是林冠植物生活在丛林里的动态过程我们做了剥离实验我们剥去了苔藓群然后观察苔藓重新长出来的速度我们估计它们会长得很快并且它们会先从边上长出来但我们最后发现，其实它们花了相当长的时间20多年才长出来从底部慢慢生长甚至到现在，25年后它们没有长到那里，没有完全覆盖树表我用这张小图想说的是藓类就是这样如果它们消失了，它们就没了如果你足够幸运，你可能让它们从底部重新长出来
en:I was interested, and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interestedin the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest.We&#39;ve done stripping experimentswhere we&#39;ve removed mats of epiphytesand looked at the rates of recolonization.We had predicted that they would grow back very quicklyand that they would come in encroaching from the side.What we found, however, was that they took an extremely long time —over 20 years — to regenerate,starting from the bottom and growing up.And even now, after 25 years,they&#39;re not up there, they have not recolonized completely.And I use this little image to saythis is what happens to mosses.If it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s gone,and if you&#39;re really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom.

zh-cn:笑

zh-cn:所以，重新覆盖真的是非常慢这些林冠系统是很脆弱的那么，当我们一起俯瞰这个保护完好的主要丛林的林冠我们看到大量的碳化物如今林冠研究者面临的一个挑战是尝试了解林冠所吸收的碳化物量我们知道有很多但我们还不知道到底有多少又是通过什么途径这些碳化物被环境中吸收储存在藓类上，然后到整个生态系统
en:So, recolonization is really very slow.These canopy communities are fragile.Well, when we look out, you and I, over that canopyof the intact primary forest,what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon.One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking todayis trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered.We know it&#39;s a lot,but we do not yet know the answers to how much,and by what processes, carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere,held in its biomass, and moving on through the ecosystem.

zh-cn:所以我想我应该像你们展示了林冠上生活的生物并不仅仅是微不足道的的一点林冠高处的绿色那是泰山和珍妮感兴趣的而且他们培育了生物多样性帮助生态系统的营养循环他们也有益于全球气候的稳定
en:So I hope I&#39;ve showed you that canopy-dwellersare not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopythat Tarzan and Jane were interested in,but rather that they foster biodiversitycontribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles,and they also help to keep our global climate stable.

zh-cn:在林冠高处，如果你与我坐在一起如是你朝四周看一下那些主要的森林生态系统你也会看到这样的情景森林破坏，森林砍伐大片森林被分块于是保存完好的林冠也无法发挥它所具有的伟大作用就像当它没有受到人类的影响时
en:Up in the canopy, if you were sitting next to meand you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems,you would also see scenes like this.Scenes of forest destruction, forest harvestingand forest fragmentation,thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopyunable to function in the marvelous ways that it haswhen it is not disturbed by humans.

zh-cn:我也观察了这样的城市地区并思考着那些一生中与树木不太接触的人那些生活在这种地区的人没有什么机会爬树，与树林和森林建立感情像我还是小女孩的时候那样这让我很头疼
en:I&#39;ve also looked out on urban places like thisand thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives.People who grew up in a place like thisdid not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with treesand forests, as I did when I was a young girl.This troubles me.

zh-cn:你知道，在2009年，成为森林生态学家专心研究这些问题并找到答案不是件容易的事你知道，特别是作为一个身材矮小的棕色皮肤女性在一个小型的学院，在我们国家的西北部远离权力和金钱我真的必须问自己：在这个问题上我到底可以做什么呢我该如何重新把人和树联系起来
en:Here in 2009, you know, it&#39;s not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist,gripping ourselves with these kinds of questionsand trying to figure out how we can answer them.And especially, you know, as a small brown womanin a little college, in the upper northwest part of our country,far away from the areas of power and money,I really have to ask myself, &quot;What can I do about this?How can I reconnect people with trees?&quot;
时间： 6:54
zh-cn:我想我可以做些事作为一位科学家，我有知识作为一个人， 我可以与任何人交流无论是内行还是外行所以我就开始行动我想要首次向大家介绍国际林冠互联网我们与媒体交流这些关于林冠的问题我们有一个关于林冠的杂志我们有邮件LISTSERV然后我们尝试着去推广林冠的重要性林冠的魅力保护完好的林冠的重要性向学科外的人我们意识到我们的很多产品像那些视频或其他并不是所有人都能接触到的所以我们一直在创建一个项目，可以让学科外的人和生态学家的组织以外的人接触到
en:Well, I think that I can do something.I know that as a scientist, I have informationand as a human being, I can communicate with anybody,inside or outside of academia.And so, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve begin doing,and so I&#39;d like to unveil the International Canopy Network here.We consult to the media about canopy questions;we have a canopy newsletter;we have an email LISTSERV.And so we&#39;re trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy,the beauty of the canopy,the necessity of intact canopies,to people outside of academia.We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make —those videos and so forth —you know, they don&#39;t reach everybody,and so we&#39;ve been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia,and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to.

en:We&#39;ve also made partnerships with artists,with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beautyof trees and forest canopies.And I&#39;d like to just tell you one of our projects,which is the generation of Canopy Confluences.What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds,and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms;and we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy,and we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together.The results have been fantastic.

zh-cn:我给你们举一些例子这是布鲁斯超的一个装置他是雕塑和玻璃吹制学院的院长在罗德岛设计学校他在西北太平洋的林冠聚会上看到林冠上的鸟巢并设计了这个漂亮的雕塑我们也让舞蹈者上到林冠乔帝鲁玛斯克和她出色的剧团Capacitor参加了我在哥斯达黎加雨林基地的林冠聚会他们编排了一个很棒的舞蹈叫Biome
en:I&#39;ll just give you a few examples.This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chaowho is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Departmentat Rhode Island School of Design.He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluencesin the Pacific Northwest, and created this beautiful sculpture.We&#39;ve had dance people up in the canopy.Jodi Lomask, and her wonderful troupe Capacitor,joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica.They made a fabulous dance called &quot;Biome.&quot;

en:They danced in the forest,and we are taking this dance, my scientific outreach communications,and also linking up with environmental groups,to go to different cities and to performthe science, the dance and the environmental outreachthat we hope will make a difference.We brought musicians to the canopy,and they made their music — and it&#39;s fantastic music.We had wooden flutists, we had oboists,we had opera singers, we had guitar players,and we had rap singers.And I brought a little segment to give youof Duke Brady&#39;s &quot;Canopy Rap.&quot;(Music) That&#39;s Duke!

zh-cn:与杜克一起工作的经历激发了我去创办一个叫音乐科学的项目我能看到杜克的歌对城市青年人的影响作为一个中年教授我不寄希望于我能让他们相信林野的重要性所以我请了考逊，这位说唱歌手与一群从塔科马内城来的年轻人我们到了森林，我捡起一根树枝考逊就开始用树枝来表演说唱突然之间这个树枝变得特别酷于是这些学生会来我们的音乐工作室他们用他们自己的节拍创作音乐最后制成CD将CD带回家给家人和朋友听通过这种方式他们表达了与自然接触的经历
en:This experience of working with Dukealso led me to initiate a program called Sound Science.I saw the power of Duke&#39;s song with urban youth —an audience, you know, I as a middle-aged professor,I don&#39;t have a hope of getting to —in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands.So I engaged Caution, this rap singer,with a group of young people from inner-city Tacoma.We went out to the forest, I would pick up a branch,Caution would rap on it,and suddenly that branch was really cool.And then the students would come into our sound studios,they would make their own rap songs with their own beats.They ended up making a CDwhich they took home to their family and friends,thereby expressing their own experiences with naturein their own medium.

zh-cn:我想说的最后一个项目是特别贴近我的心灵的这个项目有它的经济和社会价值也与附生植物有关在太平洋西北部有一种产业就是从古老的森林里收集苔藓这些苔藓从森林中获取然后被花艺产业的花匠利用来做编织物和吊篮这个产业能创收2亿6千五百万并且增收迅速如果你们还记得这些秃的树木你们就知道这些树干被剥去了什么东西在太平洋西北部的古老森林里需要几十年才能恢复所以这个产业是不符合可持续发展的那么作为生态学家，我能做什么呢
en:The final project I&#39;ll talk about is one that&#39;s very close to my heart,and it involves an economic and social valuethat is associated with epiphytic plants.In the Pacific Northwest,there&#39;s a whole industry of moss-harvestingfrom old-growth forests.These mosses are taken from the forest;they&#39;re used by the floriculture industry, by florists,to make arrangements and make hanging baskets.It&#39;s a 265 million dollar industryand it&#39;s increasing rapidly.If you remember that bald guy,you&#39;ll know that what has been stripped off of these trunksin the Pacific Northwest old-growth forestis going to take decades and decades to come back.So this whole industry is unsustainable.What can I, as an ecologist, do about that?
时间：11:30
zh-cn:我的想法是我可以学习怎样种植苔藓这样的话我们就不需从野外采集苔藓并且我想如果有人在这件事上可以帮我那也很不错于是我想可能那些被监禁的男女他们不能接触到自然但他们有很多时间和空间他们也不需要尖锐的工具去种植苔藓会是很好的合作对象并且他们已经成为很棒的合作者是我可想像的最好的他们工作非常积极
en:Well, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses,and that way we wouldn&#39;t have to take them out of the wild.And I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this,that would be great.And so, I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women —who don&#39;t have access to nature,who often have a lot of time, they often have space,and you don&#39;t need any sharp tools to work with mosses —would be great partners.And they have become excellent partners.The best I can imagine.They were very enthusiastic.

zh-cn:他们有着不可思议的工作热情他们学着去分辨不同种类的苔藓老实告诉你们吧这比我在Evergreen College（一所学校）的本科生可分辨的要多得多并且他们抓住这个可以帮助研究计划的发展的机会来种植这些苔藓作为合作伙伴我们成功地了解了哪种苔藓长得最快我也一直难以抑制这样的成功感因为监狱长也对这个研究充满着热情我在监狱里开办了科学和可持续性的讲座我带着我的科学团队和可持续性实践专家去了监狱每个月讲座一次这最终成了一个在监狱实行的一个令人吃惊的可持续性发展项目有机花园，桑蚕养植法，回收利用集水处，养蜂
en:They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.They learned how to distinguish different species of mosses,which, to tell you the truth,is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do.And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research designin order to grow these mosses.We&#39;ve been successful as partnersin figuring out which species grow the fastest,and I&#39;ve just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been.Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well,I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons.I brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison.We gave talks once a month,and that actually ended up implementingsome amazing sustainability projects at the prisons —organic gardens, worm culture, recycling,water catchment and beekeeping.

zh-cn:在华盛顿州监狱局的支持下他们要求我们把这个项目扩展到另外三个监狱并且我们新的项目是让犯人和我们自己一起学习怎么养殖俄勒冈州点蛙点蛙是华盛世顿和俄勒冈州濒临灭绝的两栖动物所以犯人们在密闭的环境中养殖点蛙从卵到蝌蚪再到青蛙他们很多人都感受到了快乐当看到这些卵在他们的抚育下长大成青蛙然后把青蛙带到野外保护区在野外繁殖增加这种濒临物种的数量
en:from the Department of Corrections at Washington state,they&#39;ve asked us to expand this program to three more prisons.And our new project is having the inmates and ourselveslearn how to raise the Oregon spotted frogwhich is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon.So they will raise them — in captivity, of course —from eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs.And they will have the pleasure, many of them,of seeing those frogs that they&#39;ve raised from eggs and helped develop,helped nurture, move out into protected wildlandsto augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild.
时间：13:38
zh-cn:所以我想，从各个方面讲生态的，社会的，经济的或可能是精神上的这是一个很了不起的项目我真的期望不仅是我和我的学生在做我也希望鼓励或教授其他的科学家如何去做相信你们大多数人明白，学术界不太关心外界我尝试着帮助研究人员更关注外界建立他们与学科领域外的人的合伙关系所以我正希望着我的丈夫杰克，一位蚂蚁分类学者可以与美泰儿公司合作去生产分类学者Ken(男性芭比娃娃）可能本赞德和比尔盖茨可以合作创作关于爱滋的戏剧或者可能艾尔戈尔和Naturally 7（一个乐队）能合作创作关于气候变化的歌曲那才真的能让你们拍案叫绝
en:And so, I think for many reasons —ecological, social, economic and perhaps even spiritual —this has been a tremendous projectand I&#39;m really looking forward tonot only myself and my students doing it,but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this.As many of you are aware, the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one.I&#39;m trying to help researchers move more outwardto have their own partnershipswith people outside of the academic community.And so I&#39;m hoping that my husband Jack, the ant taxonomist,can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken.Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get togetherand make an opera about AIDS.Or perhaps Al Gore and Naturally 7 could make a song about climate changethat would really make you clap your hands.
时间：14:29
zh-cn:虽然这有点幻想，但我觉得这也很实际考虑到我们现在感觉环境上的压抑现在是科学家们该更关注外界事物的时候了也是科学学科的外行们该了解各学科的时候我的事业是一开始试图去了解森林的神秘用各种科学方法通过我先前向你们描述的这些合作项目我才真正在开拓了我的思维，我得说，我的心灵对事物有了更深的了解对自然和自身有了其他的发现
en:So, although it&#39;s a little bit of a fantasy, I think it&#39;s also a reality.Given the duress that we&#39;re feeling environmentally in these times,it is time for scientists to reach outward,and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well.I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forestswith the tools of science.By making these partnerships that I described to you,I have really opened my mind and, I have to say, my heartto have a greater understanding,to make other discoveries about nature and myself.
时间：15:05
zh-cn:当我审视我的内心时，我看到了树这其实是一颗真正心脏的图片在我们的内心有树在你们的内心也有树当我们了解了自然我们也正在触摸着我们自己最深，最重要的部分在这些合作中，我也明白了人们总喜欢把他们分类成电脑科技人才，电影明星，科学家但当他们分享自然时当我们分享对自然的看法时我们找到了一个共同点
en:When I look into my heart, I see trees —this is actually an image of a real heart —there are trees in our hearts,there are trees in your hearts.When we come to understand nature,we are touching the most deep, the most important parts of our self.In these partnerships, I have also learnedthat people tend to compartmentalize themselvesinto IT people, and movie star people, and scientists,but when we share nature,when we share our perspectives about nature,we find a common denominator.
时间：15:39
zh-cn:最后，作为一位科学家，一个普通的人现在作为TED的一员我发现我有更好的方法去研究树，研究森林，研究自然对自然有新的发现对人在自然中的地位有新的发现不论我们在哪里，不论我们是谁
en:Finally, as a scientist and as a personand now, as part of the TED community,I feel that I have better toolsto go out to trees, to go out to forests, to go out to nature,to make new discoveries about nature —and about humans&#39; place in naturewherever we are and whomever you are.
