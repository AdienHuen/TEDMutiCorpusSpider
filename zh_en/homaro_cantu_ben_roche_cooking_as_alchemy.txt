zh-cn:本.罗切：我是本哈马罗·坎图：我是哈马罗我们是厨师Moto在2004年开业的时候 人们并不知道我们卖的是什么 许多人以为这是家日本餐馆可能是因为店名或者标志看起来像日本文字 反正 我们收到了许多要点日本菜的要求其实我们不卖日本菜在收到第一万次寿司卷的要求之后我们决定满足人们的要求这张照片是一份平面食物这是我们进行味道改造的首次尝试寿司卷的所有材料 所有味道都被印到了一小张纸上
en:Ben Roche: So I&#39;m Ben, by the way.Homaro Cantu: And I&#39;m Homaro.BR: And we&#39;re chefs. So when Motoopened in 2004, people didn&#39;t really knowwhat to expect. A lot of people thoughtthat it was a Japanese restaurant, andmaybe it was the name, maybe it wasthe logo, which was like a Japanesecharacter, but anyway, we had all theserequests for Japanese food, which isreally not what we did. And after aboutthe ten thousandth request for a maki roll,we decided to give the peoplewhat they wanted. So this picture isan example of printed food, and this wasthe first foray into what we like to callflavor transformation. So this is allthe ingredients, all the flavor of, you know,a standard maki roll, printed ontoa little piece of paper.

zh-cn:后来 客人们都吃厌了我们延续这个思路决定给他们双份同样的食物我们把寿司卷中的一样材料拿出来给这道菜照了张照片把照片上的菜一起端上桌这道菜主要是香槟和海鲜上面的香槟葡萄实际上是碳酸葡萄一点点海鲜和一些鲜奶油这张照片的味道和这道菜一模一样（众人笑）我们并不满足于做出可食用的照片我们决定玩些新花样 把人们熟知的味道进行改变 这一次我们做的是胡萝卜蛋糕我们把一个胡萝卜蛋糕放进搅拌机打成汁 接着把它灌进一个在液态氮中冷冻的气球中在这个空壳中形成胡萝卜蛋糕冰淇淋它看起来就像木星悬浮在你的盘子上
en:HC: So our diners started to get boredwith this idea, and we decided to give themthe same course twice, so here we actuallytook an element from the maki roll andand took a picture of a dish and thenbasically served that picture with the dish.So this dish in particular is basicallychampagne with seafood.The champagne grapes that you see areactually carbonated grapes. A little bit ofseafood and some crème fraiche and thepicture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter)BR: But it&#39;s not all just edible pictures.We decided to do somethinga little bit different and transform flavorsthat were very familiar — so in this case,we have carrot cake.So we take a carrot cake, put itin a blender, and we have kind of likea carrot cake juice, and then that went intoa balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to createthis hollow shell of carrot cakeice cream, I guess, and it comes offlooking like, you know,Jupiter&#39;s floating around your plate.

zh-cn:我们把东西变成你们从来没见过的东西有些菜看起来跟食物搭不上任何关系这是一支雪茄一支用古巴猪肉三明治做成的古巴雪茄我们把猪肩肉用调味料淹好制作出烟灰的效果在把它裹在一片羽衣甘蓝叶里 加上一个可食用标签这个标签不与高希霸雪茄的任何标签雷同我们把这道菜摆在一个价值1.99美元的烟灰缸上20美元卖给你（众人笑）味道好极了
en:So yeah, we&#39;re transforming things intosomething that you have absolutelyno reference for.HC: And here&#39;s something we have noreference to eat. This is a cigar, andbasically it&#39;s a Cuban cigar made out ofa Cuban pork sandwich, so we take thesespices that go into the pork shoulder,we fashion that into ash. We takethe sandwich and wrap it up ina collard green, put an edible labelthat bears no similarity toa Cohiba cigar label, and we put itin a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and chargeyou about twenty bucks for it. (Laughter)HC: Delicious.

zh-cn:这还没完呢除了把食物做成不能吃的东西的样子我们决定把材料做成你们熟悉的食物这是一盘玉米片我们的玉米片和其他人的玉米片不同之处在于它其实是一道甜点玉米片是用糖做的碎牛肉是巧克力做的奶酪是用芒果冰糕做的冰糕在液态氮中被切成丝看起来酷似奶酪完成所有这些将食材进行改造和重组我们发现这种做法非常有意思当把这道菜端上桌奶酪开始融化我们发现这道菜产生了和原菜同样的效果当你在餐厅里看着这道菜你还真的以为这是一盘玉米片直到你尝上一口才惊觉这其实是一道甜点让人大吃一惊（众人笑）
en:BR: That&#39;s not it, though.Instead of making foods thatlook like things that you wouldn&#39;t eat,we decided to make ingredientslook like dishes that you know.So this is a plate of nachos.The difference between our nachosand the other guy&#39;s nachos,is that this is actually a dessert.So the chips are candied,the ground beef is made from chocolate,and the cheese is made from a shreddedmango sorbet that gets shreddedinto liquid nitrogen to look like cheese.And after doing all of thisdematerialization and reconfiguringof this, of these ingredients, we realizedthat it was pretty cool,because as we served it, we learned thatthe dish actually behaves like the real thing,where the cheese begins to melt.So when you&#39;re looking at this thingin the dining room, you have this sensationthat this is actually a plate of nachos,and it&#39;s not really until you begin tasting itthat you realize this is a dessert, andit&#39;s just kind of like a mind-ripper.(Laughter)

zh-cn:我们创造这些菜式的地方与其说是厨房不如说是机械车间下一步自然就是在建造一间先进的实验室这就是我们的设备这些设备放置在地下室里我们对食物进行严肃的研究好比在进行严谨的实验这个地方很棒的一点是除了在厨房里建起了科学实验室我们还得到了新设备新方法打开了我们之前意想不到的创新之门我们进行的试验和创造的菜式能够越走越远
en:HC: So we had been creatingall of these dishes out of akitchen that was more likea mechanic&#39;s shop than a kitchen, andthe next logical step for us was to installa state-of-the-art laboratory,and that&#39;s what we have here.So we put this in the basement, and wegot really serious about food, likeserious experimentation.BR: One of the really cool things aboutthe lab, besides that we have a newscience lab in the kitchen, is that,you know, with this new equipment, andthis new approach, all thesedifferent doors to creativity that we neverknew were there began to open, and so theexperiments and the food and the dishesthat we created, they just kept goingfurther and further out there.

zh-cn:我们来说一说味道的改造我们来创造一些好东西这是一头牛 它伸出了舌头我看 它正准备美餐一顿这头牛吃什么呢为什么那么美味这头牛主要吃三样食物玉米 甜菜头 大麦于是我向员工提出了一个疯狂的要求我们能不能用牛吃的食物来取代牛肉来制作汉堡结果员工的反应大多都是这样的 （众人笑）这位是我们的厨师长克里斯·琼斯他不是唯一一个被我们荒唐的任务逼疯的人许多这些想法都很难理解不是一时半会就能弄明白的
en:HC: Let&#39;s talk about flavor transformation,and let&#39;s actually make some cool stuff.You see a cow with its tongue hanging out.What I see is a cow about to eat somethingdelicious. What is that cow eating?And why is it delicious?So the cow, basically, eats three basicthings in their feed: corn, beets, and barley,and so what I do is I actuallychallenge my staff with these crazy,wild ideas. Can we take what the coweats, remove the cow, and then makesome hamburgers out of that?And basically the reaction tends to bekind of like this. (Laughter)BR: Yeah, that&#39;s our chef de cuisine,Chris Jones. This is not the only guythat just flips out when we assigna ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas,they&#39;re hard to understand.They&#39;re hard to just get automatically.

zh-cn:要做许多研究每试验一道菜都经历失败 尝试 错误 错误占大多数我们并不总是一帆风顺要花上一些功夫向人们解释我和克里斯面面相觑了一整天之后我们找到了一种非常接近汉堡肉饼的东西你看它看起来跟汉堡肉差不多这是由三种原料制成的甜菜头 大麦 玉米它煮熟之后就像汉堡肉模样和味道都像汉堡肉不仅如此我们还把牛肉从这个过程中省去了我们的目标是复制食物 在此基础上更进一步（众人鼓掌）
en:There&#39;s a lot of research and a lot offailure, trial and error — I guess, more error —that goes into each and every dish,so we don&#39;t always get it right, and it takesa while for us to be able to explain thatto people.HC: So, after about a day of Chris and Istaring at each other, we came up withsomething that was pretty closeto the hamburger patty, and as you cansee it basically forms like hamburger meat.This is made from three ingredients:beets, barley, corn, and so itactually cooks up like hamburger meat,looks and tastes like hamburger meat,and not only that, but it&#39;s basicallyremoving the cow from the equation.So replicating food, taking it into thatnext level is where we&#39;re going.(Applause)

zh-cn:这可谓是世界上第一个血淋淋的素汉堡啊不错的附加效果这是神秘果一种天然调料含有一种特殊成分即一种名为神秘果蛋白的糖类蛋白是纯天然的我每次吃它 都感到不可思议它能够蒙骗舌头上的某些味蕾主要是酸味味蕾所以那些味道酸涩的食物尝起来是非常甜的你吃一个柠檬像在喝加糖的柠檬汁试想一下这蕴含着多大的经济实惠啊我们可以省去所有糖类食品和汽水中的糖而用全天然鲜果取而代之
en:BR: And it&#39;s definitely the world&#39;s firstbleeding veggie burger,which is a cool side effect.And a miracle berry, if you&#39;re not familiarwith it, is a natural ingredient, and itcontains a special property.It&#39;s a glycoprotein called miraculin,a naturally occurring thing. It still freaksme out every time I eat it, but it has aunique ability to mask certain tastereceptors on your tongue, so that primarilysour taste receptors, so normally thingsthat would taste very sour or tart,somehow begin to taste very sweet.HC: You&#39;re about to eat a lemon,and now it tastes like lemonade.Let&#39;s just stop and think about theeconomic benefits of something like that.We could eliminate sugar across the boardfor all confectionary products and sodas,and we can replace it withall-natural fresh fruit.

zh-cn:你看 我们在切西瓜我们的想法是通过在本地制作金枪鱼肉或其他异域或风味食品来省去外地制作同样的食品所耗费的食物里程和能源并杜绝了过度捕捞金枪鱼因此 我们拿来了一个产自威斯康辛州的西瓜神秘果能把酸的食物变成甜食我们还有另一种神奇药粉能把西瓜的甜味变咸经过这样的处理后我们将西瓜真空包装 加一点海苔调味料 把它一卷它开始变得像金枪鱼肉而关键是让它吃起来也像金枪鱼肉在液态氮中迅速蘸一下它得到恰到好处的焦脆质感这样 我们就做出了与金枪鱼口感一模一样的替代品
en:BR: So you see us here cutting upsome watermelon. The idea with thisis that we&#39;re going to eliminate tons offood miles, wasted energy,and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna,or any exotic produce or itemfrom a very far-away place,with local, organic produce;so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.HC: So if miracle berries take sour thingsand turn them into sweet things,we have this other pixie dustthat we put on the watermelon, and itmakes it go from sweet to savory.So after we do that, we put it intoa vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed,some spices, and we roll it, and thisstarts taking on the appearance of tuna.So the key now is to make itbehave like tuna.BR: And then after a quick dip into someliquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear,we really have something that looks,tastes and behaves like the real thing.

zh-cn:重要的是我们并不在乎这是不是真的金枪鱼只要对人的健康和环境有好处 就行了但是这一步怎么走呢我们如何把这个蒙蔽味蕾的手法进一步升华来发展出颠覆性的食品科技下一项挑战任务来了我对手下说我们拿一堆野生植物只要它们对人体无害都拿来当作调料到芝加哥的大街上随手摘下来 搅碎 煮一煮让在Moto店里的每个顾客都尝尝收他们一大笔钱看看他们有什么反应 （众人笑）
en:HC: So the key thing to remember here is,we don&#39;t really carewhat this tuna really is.As long as it&#39;s good for you and good forthe environment, it doesn&#39;t matter.But where is this going?How can we take this idea of tricking yourtastebuds and leapfrog it into somethingthat we can do today that could bea disruptive food technology?So here&#39;s the next challenge.I told the staff, let&#39;s just take a bunchof wild plants, think of them asfood ingredients. As long as they&#39;renon-poisonous to the human body,go out around Chicago sidewalks,take it, blend it, cook it and thenhave everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto.Let&#39;s charge them a boatload of cash for thisand see what they think. (Laughter)

zh-cn:你们可以想象得到这又是一项让员工把我们恨得咬牙切齿的任务但我们几乎不得不重新学习如何烹饪因为我们对这些材料植物的生长周期都不熟悉我们也不知道怎么烹饪这些材料因为人们平时都不吃这些东西我们不得不想出新奇的方法来调味 来烹饪来改变口感这些是主要的挑战所在
en:BR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a tasklike this — this is another one of thoseassignments that the kitchen staffhated us for. But we really had to almostrelearn how to cook in general,because these are ingredients, you know,plant life that we&#39;re, one, unfamiliar with,and two, we have no reference for howto cook these things becausepeople don&#39;t eat them.So we really had to think about new, creative waysto flavor, new ways to cookand to change texture — and that wasthe main issue with this challenge.

zh-cn:这就是我们未来发展的方向我们向前跨越所以发展中国家和第一世界国家设想如果你能把这些野生植物拿去消费 你就能大大缩短食物里程这种对食物的概念颠覆性的思维能够让食材的定义更加丰富多彩如果面粉能够被取代我们就能省下大量能源减少浪费这里有一个例子我们可以给顾客吃这些东西这是一袋稻草还有一些山楂我们把稻草和山楂做成了烧烤酱尝过这种烧烤酱的人都说这跟真的烧烤酱没有区别 而这不花一分钱谢谢大家
en:HC: So this is where we step into the futureand we leapfrog ahead.So developing nationsand first-world nations,imagine if you could take these wild plantsand consume them, food miles wouldbasically turn into food feet.This disruptive mentality of what food iswould essentially open up the encyclopediaof what raw ingredients are, even if we justswapped out, say, one of these for flour,that would eliminate so much energyand so much waste.And to give you a simple example here as towhat we actually fed these customers,there&#39;s a bale of hay thereand some crab apples.And basically we took hay and crab applesand made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients.People swore they were eatingbarbecue sauce, and this is free food.BR: Thanks, guys.
