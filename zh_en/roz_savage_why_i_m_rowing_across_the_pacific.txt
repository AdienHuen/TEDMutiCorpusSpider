zh-cn:大家好，我是罗兹·萨维奇我划船穿越大洋。四年前，我曾独自划船横渡了大西洋，之后，我又完成了跨越太平洋的两个阶段，从旧金山到夏威夷以及从夏威夷到基里巴斯。明天，我将离开这条船飞回基里巴斯去继续我第三段也是最后一段横渡太平洋的旅程。我一共要划行8000多英里，做300多万个划船动作，在23英尺长的小船上，我将独自在海上渡过超过312天。这次旅程使我和海洋的关系非比寻常。我们对事物或多或少都会热爱或者讨厌的情绪，我的感觉就如同以前在学校里和我那个严厉的数学老师相处一样我并不是一直都喜欢她，但是我的确很尊敬她。她教会了我许多许多今天在这里我想与大家分享一些我横渡大洋时的冒险经历同时，也想告诉大家海洋究竟都教会了我什么我想也许我们能从中吸取一些经验用它们来应对我们现在所面对的环境挑战
en:Hi, my name is Roz Savageand I row across oceans.Four years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic,and since then, I&#39;ve done two out of three stagesacross the Pacific,from San Francisco to Hawaiiand from Hawaii to Kiribati.And tomorrow, I&#39;ll be leaving this boatto fly back to Kiribatito continue with the third and final stageof my row across the Pacific.Cumulatively, I will have rowedover 8,000 miles,taken over three million oar strokesand spent more than 312 days aloneon the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.This has given me a veryspecial relationship with the ocean.We have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.I feel a bit about it like I did abouta very strict math teacher that I once had at school.I didn&#39;t always like her, but I did respect her,and she taught me a heck of a lot.So today I&#39;d like to share with yousome of my ocean adventuresand tell you a little bit about what they&#39;ve taught me,and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessonsand apply them to this environmental challengethat we face right now.

zh-cn:在座的有些人现在一定可能在想“得了吧，她长得一点也不像个横渡大洋者”她是不是长得这么高或者这么强壮是不是和这些家伙们有那么一点相似呢?大家看得出他们具备的一些东西我的确没有我不知道大家心理想的是什么，我是指我没有他们那样的胡子无论我在大洋上渡过多长时间我依然无法让自己拥有他们那样的漂亮胡子我希望还是保持原状吧
en:Now, some of you might be thinking,&quot;Hold on a minute. She doesn&#39;t look very much like an ocean rower.Isn&#39;t she meant to be about this talland about this wideand maybe look a bit more like these guys?&quot;You&#39;ll notice, they&#39;ve all got something that I don&#39;t.Well, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re thinking, but I&#39;m talking about the beards. (Laughter)And no matter how long I&#39;ve spent on the ocean,I haven&#39;t yet managed to muster a decent beard,and I hope that it remains that way.

zh-cn:在很长一段时间里，我都无法相信自己可以去冒险我所认为的冒险就是这些人所做的看上去，我不适合这样的冒险我曾经觉得我们和他们是两种人，而我不能成为他们中的一员所以在11年里，我默守陈规我完成了我这个背景的人应该做的事情我以前在伦敦的一间办公室里作管理顾问的工作我想我从工作的第一天就知道这份工作并不对我的心思但是那份工作的丰厚待遇还是让我从事了多年一直到我三十四、五岁的时候，我意识到“是啊，我已经不再年轻。我知道我的人生当中还有追求，但我不知道是什么，我十分确定的是，管理顾问工作绝不是我追求的目标。
en:For a long time, I didn&#39;t believe that I could have a big adventure.The story that I told myself wasthat adventurers looked like this.I didn&#39;t look the part.I thought there were them and there were us,and I was not one of them.So for 11 years, I conformed.I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.I was working in an office in Londonas a management consultant.And I think I knew from day one that it wasn&#39;t the right job for me.But that kind of conditioningjust kept me there for so many years,until I reached my mid-30s and I thought,&quot;You know, I&#39;m not getting any younger.I feel like I&#39;ve got a purpose in this life, and I don&#39;t know what it is,but I&#39;m pretty certain that management consultancy is not it.

zh-cn:几年的时间转瞬即逝我也经历了一些改变我认真思考回答了这个问题在我的人生里，我到底最想做什么？终于有一天，我坐下来为自己写了两种不同的讣告一个是我想要的，是充满了冒险经历的一生而另一个则是按照我现在的生活轨迹所能达到的一个享受正常、安逸、舒适生活的一生而在我生命终结时，后者并不是我想要达到的目标我希望拥有一个我为之自豪的一生我记得我面对着我的这两份讣告心想：哦，天呐，我处在错误的人生轨道上如果我继续这样生活下去我是不会完成我生命的终极目标的不论是在5年还是10年内甚至到生命走到尽头是，我都不会完成。我做了一些改变放弃了一些以前生活的奢华经过几次逻辑跳跃然后决定去横渡大西洋
en:So, fast forward a few years.I&#39;d gone through some changes.To try and answer that question of,&quot;What am I supposed to be doing with my life?&quot;I sat down one dayand wrote two versions of my own obituary,the one that I wanted, a life of adventure,and the one that I was actually heading forwhich was a nice, normal, pleasant life,but it wasn&#39;t where I wanted to be by the end of my life.I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituaryand thinking, &quot;Oh boy,I&#39;m on totally the wrong track here.If I carry on living as I am now,I&#39;m just not going to end up where I want to bein five years, or 10 years,or at the end of my life.&quot;I made a few changes,let go of some loose trappings of my old life,and through a bit of a leap of logic,decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.

zh-cn:划船横渡大西洋的行程从卡纳里亚斯群岛到安提瓜行程大约3000英里而这次旅程也成为了我所完成的最困难的事的确，我曾很想摆脱我安逸的生活但是我确从来没意识到跳我舒适生活之外，我却过得如此不舒服而且，我对时机的把握也不是很好2005年，我正在横渡大西洋的时候也正是卡特里娜飓风肆虐的那一年北大西洋上的热带风暴也多于史上有纪录的任何时候很快这些风暴就显示出了它们的威力
en:The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua,it&#39;s about 3,000 miles,and it turned out to bethe hardest thing I had ever done.Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,but what I&#39;d sort of failed to notice was thatgetting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,extremely uncomfortable.And my timing was not great either:2005, when I did the Atlantic,was the year of Hurricane Katrina.There were more tropical storms in the North Atlanticthan ever before, since records began.And pretty early on,those storms started making their presence known.

zh-cn:我的四个桨在我的行程还没有达到一半的时候就全坏了看上去，桨不应该是这样的但，你又能怎么办？你正处在大洋当中这些桨是你唯一的动力来源我只好找遍了整条船想办法找到能够修好这些桨的东西，这样才能继续我的旅程我找到了一个船竿和我信赖的多功能胶布然后，我把船竿弄断用它们加固船桨然后，等它们不起作用了我又把我的备用划船座椅的轮轴锯了下来用它们来修我的桨当它们不起走用了，我又把我的一支坏桨拆下来使用我以前并不是一个擅长修补的人但当你身处海洋之中的时候你会惊奇地发现你变得能够随机应变而这也是通向彼岸的唯一办法
en:All four of my oars brokebefore I reached halfway across.Oars are not supposed to look like this.But what can you do? You&#39;re in the middle of the ocean.Oars are your only means of propulsion.So I just had to look around the boatand figure out what I was going to useto fix up these oars so that I could carry on.So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tapeand splintered the boat hookto the oars to reinforce it.Then, when that gave out,I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seatand used those.And then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.I&#39;d never been very good at fixing stuffwhen I was living my old life,but it&#39;s amazing how resourceful you can becomewhen you&#39;re in the middle of the oceanand there&#39;s only one way to get to the other side.

zh-cn:这些桨也变成了我可以用多种方式来突破我自认为是极限的标志肩部的腱鞘炎让我十分痛苦海水也杀的臀部非常疼我在心理上也非常挣扎过，完全是因为挑战的规模之大击垮了我我意识到，如果我按照每小时2英里的速度划行3000英里会让我划行很长很长时间好几次，我都觉得自己已经达到了极限但我没有别的选择，只有一路向前我必须努力克制自己，好让自己能够知道如何前行达到彼岸
en:And the oars kind of became a symbolof just in how many waysI went beyond what I thought were my limits.I suffered from tendinitis on my shouldersand saltwater sores on my bottom.I really struggled psychologically,totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,3,000 miles was going totake me a very, very long time.There were so many timeswhen I thought I&#39;d hit that limit,but had no choice but to just carry onand try and figure out how I was going to get to the other sidewithout driving myself crazy.

zh-cn:最终在海上航行了103天以后我终于抵达了安提瓜在我整个人生里，我从没这么高兴过这感觉有点像把完成了马拉松、走出禁闭室以及赢得了奥斯卡的感觉合在一起的感觉那一刻，我心潮澎湃所有的人都跑过来向我问候人们站在悬崖顶上鼓掌和唤呼我觉得自己像电影明星那感觉简直太棒了我也确实明白了一个道理，困难越大往往最终获得的成就感就越大
en:And eventually after103 days at sea,I arrived in Antigua.I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt so happyin my entire life.It was a bit like finishing a marathonand getting out of solitary confinementand winning an Oscar all rolled into one.I was euphoric.And to see all the people coming out to greet meand standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,I just felt like a movie star.It was absolutely wonderful.And I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,the bigger the sense of achievementwhen you get to the end of it.

zh-cn:现在也许正好可以利用一点时间来进行关于大洋横渡的一些问题的解答当然，这些问题有可能就是你们想问的第一个问题是：你都吃什么？有时候我会吃冷冻的干食，但大部分时间我都会尝试吃更多的未加工的食品我自己会种一些豆芽我会吃水果和一些坚果块我吃了许多的坚果到达终点的时候，我大概瘦了30磅问题2：你怎样睡觉？当然是把眼睛闭上了啊，哈哈我猜你们是想问如果你睡着了，船会怎样？我周密地计划过路线，在我睡着的时候我的船会随着风向和水流漂浮有一晚，运气比较好，我朝着正确的方向漂了11英里最差的一晚，则向着错误的方向漂了13英里那是工作中最糟糕的一天我穿什么衣服？我大部分的时候都会戴一顶棒球帽，一副划船手套，还有是面带微笑或者是眉头紧锁当然，这取决于夜里我的船有没有向反方向漂我还擦了许多防晒霜是否有跟着我的船?当然没有.我在海上是完全靠自己的总的来说,我在海上的时候全程没见到任何人最后一个问题:我是不是疯了?这个问题嘛,我想留给大家来评论吧
en:So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-outto answer a few FAQs about ocean rowingthat might be going through your mind.Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?A few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eatmuch more unprocessed foods.So I grow my own beansprouts.I eat fruits and nut bars,a lot of nuts.And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighterat the other end.Question number two: How do you sleep?With my eyes shut. Ha-ha.I suppose what you mean is:What happens to the boat while I&#39;m sleeping?Well, I plan my route so that I&#39;m driftingwith the winds and the currents while I&#39;m sleeping.On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 milesin the right direction.Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.That&#39;s a bad day at the office.What do I wear?Mostly, a baseball cap,rowing gloves and a smile — or a frown,depending on whether I went backwards overnight —and lots of sun lotion.Do I have a chase boat?No I don&#39;t. I&#39;m totally self-supporting out there.I don&#39;t see anybody for the whole timethat I&#39;m at sea, generally.And finally: Am I crazy?Well, I leave that one up to you to judge.

zh-cn:你怎么才能超越横渡大西洋?很自然，你会决定横渡太平洋我知道大西洋很大但是太平洋是非常非常大我认为我们应该对平常的地图做一点小小的改动我不确定是不是英国人发明了这个看世界特别角度,但是我推测是我们发明的,因为我们处在中间的位置我们把太平洋一分为二而且把它放在了天涯海角如果你用Google Earth的话,你会看到太平洋是这副模样它差不多覆盖了半个地球你能够在它的上面看到一点北美洲在下面也可以看到澳大利亚的一个边它确实太大了6500万平方英里就算是直线横渡太平洋也得有8000英里不幸的是,划船渡洋很少能走直线在我达到澳大利亚我是说如果我顺利地达到澳大利亚我大概一共要划9000到1万英里
en:So, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?Well, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.Well, I thought the Atlantic was big,but the Pacific is really, really big.I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.I don&#39;t know for sure that the Britsinvented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so:we are right in the middle,and we&#39;ve cut the Pacific in halfand flung it to the far corners of the world.Whereas if you look in Google Earth,this is how the Pacific looks.It pretty much covers half the planet.You can just see a little bit of North America up hereand a sliver of Australia down there.It is really big —65 million square miles —and to row in a straight line across itwould be about 8,000 miles.Unfortunately, ocean rowboatsvery rarely go in a straight line.By the time I get to Australia,if I get to Australia,I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.

zh-cn:所有的正常人都会考虑在划船经过夏威夷的时候顺便停留一下于是我决定把这个大航程分成三个阶段进行我的第一次尝进行得并不顺利2007年，我有一次在24小时内3次被卷入了足以令我翻船的漩涡当中感觉有点像掉进了洗衣机里我的船受到了一点损坏我也受了点轻伤我把这段经历写在了博客里.一些有英雄情结的人认为我身处困境并且需要帮助当海岸警卫队的飞机在我头上盘旋的时候我才知道这些我请他们离开我们交涉了一段时间然后，我服从了他们被接到飞机上简直太糟糕了那是我一生中心情最差的时候我被用吊绳运送到了直升飞机里我朝下面看了看与我并肩作战的小船正在20英尺高的海浪里摇摆我不知道还能不能再看见它我不得不开展了花费甚高的抢救行动然后又等待了漫长的九个月我才又可以卷土重来开始我的横渡之旅
en:So, because nobody in their straight mind would rowstraight past Hawaii without dropping in,I decided to cut this very big undertakinginto three segments.The first attempt didn&#39;t go so well.In 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drillthree times in 24 hours.A bit like being in a washing machine.Boat got a bit dinged up,so did I.I blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebodywith a bit of a hero complex decided thatthis damsel was in distress and needed saving.The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.I tried to tell them to go away.We had a bit of a battle of wills.I lost and got airlifted.Awful, really awful.It was one of the worst feelings of my life,as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopterand looked down at my trusty little boatrolling around in the 20 foot wavesand wondering if I would ever see her again.So I had to launch a very expensivesalvage operationand then wait another nine monthsbefore I could get back out onto the ocean again.

zh-cn:能怎么样呢只有屡败屡战第二年，我重新出发我这次比较走运，安全地划渡到达了夏威夷但也不是完全地一帆风顺我的制水机坏了它可是我船上最重要的装备它由太阳能电池板发电吸收海水然后把它变成淡水但如果它被海水浸泡，则不能正常运转而这样的事情却不幸地发生了万幸的是，我立刻得到了帮助
en:But what do you do?Fall down nine times, get up 10.So, the following year, I set outand, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.But it was not without misadventure.My watermaker broke,only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.Powered by my solar panels,it sucks in saltwaterand turns it into freshwater.But it doesn&#39;t react very well to being immersed in ocean,which is what happened to it.Fortunately, help was at hand.

zh-cn:正好有条与众不同的船经过那里他们和我做着同一件事情用行动来呼吁对北太平洋垃圾大陆的重视那个地区在太平洋北部，面积是德克萨斯州的两倍据北太平洋环流系统中心测试所得大约有350万吨的垃圾存在于北太平洋垃圾大陆之中为了能引起人们重视，这些家伙用塑料垃圾建造了他们的船他们把15000个空水瓶捆成了两个趸船他们航行速度缓慢他们在一定程度上被拖延他们不的不在离开长滩后不久便在卡达琳纳岛休整了一段时间因为他们所有水瓶的盖子都松动了所以他们的船开始下沉所以他们不得不停下来，把这些盖子盖紧
en:There was another unusual boat out thereat the same time, doing as I was doing,bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,with an estimated 3.5 milliontons of trash in it,circulating at the center ofthat North Pacific Gyre.So, to make the point, these guyshad actually built their boat out of plastic trash,15,000 empty water bottleslatched together into two pontoons.They were going very slowly.Partly, they&#39;d had a bit of a delay.They&#39;d had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beachbecause the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,and they were starting to sink.So they&#39;d had to pull in and do all the lids up.

zh-cn:但是正当我储备的水接近枯竭时我们幸运地碰到了一起他们没有了食物，我没有了水我们用卫星电话取得了联系，安排见面大约一周以后我们才真正会了面我划行的速度慢的可怜只有1.3海里而他们的最低速度也少于1.4海里就像两只蜗牛在缓慢地跳着交欢舞不管怎么样，我们最终还是会面了乔伊跳下船为我们抓住了一条漂亮的大鲯鳅鱼这是我在三个月以来吃到的最好吃的东西
en:But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,luckily, our courses were converging.They were running out of food; I was running out of water.So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.And it took about a weekfor us to actually gradually converge.I was doing a pathetically slow speedof about 1.3 knots,and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:it was like two snails in a mating dance.But, eventually, we did manage to meet upand Joel hopped overboard,caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,which was the best food I&#39;d hadin, ooh, at least three months.

zh-cn:我们很走运，那天抓到的鱼要比几个星期前他抓到的那要好当他们宰鱼的时候发现鱼的胃里全是塑料糟糕的是，塑料是惰性物质可怜的小生物吃下这些塑料而后塑料分解出的化学物质进入他们的肌体里然后我们再吃那些可怜的生物然后这些有毒物质也会在我们的身体里积攒起来这也会对我们人类的健康造成潜在的危害
en:Fortunately, the one that he caught that daywas better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.When they opened this one up,they found its stomach was full of plastic.And this is really bad news because plasticis not an inert substance.It leaches out chemicalsinto the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,and then we come along and eat that poor critter,and we get some of the toxins accumulatingin our bodies as well.So there are very real implications for human health.

zh-cn:最后，我还是活着到了夏威夷转年，我又出发进行我横渡太平洋的第二个阶段从夏威夷到塔拉瓦你们也许对塔拉瓦有所了解它的海拔很低它就像地平线上的一小段绿线这使得他们非常担心海平面的上升对这些人来讲，这是个大麻烦在高于海平面六英尺的地方就没有立锥之地了然而,极端天气的增多导致气候变化巨浪也会随之增多巨浪淹没岸礁就将导致他们的淡水源受到污染我在那与该国的总统会面总统也向我透露了他为国家制定的生存战略他预期在未来的50年里万千上万的该国国民将不得不去新西兰或澳大利亚定居这不禁使我思考如果某一天英国也消失在海浪里,我将会有如何的感受如果这个生我的地方我受教育的地方我结婚的地方如果这些地方将永远的消失会令我会感到多么多么的不真实
en:I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.And, the following year, set outon the second stage of the Pacific,from Hawaii down to Tarawa.And you&#39;ll notice something about Tarawa;it is very low-lying.It&#39;s that little green sliver on the horizon,which makes them very nervousabout rising oceans.This is big trouble for these guys.They&#39;ve got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.And also, as an increase in extremeweather events due to climate change,they&#39;re expecting more wavesto come in over the fringing reef,which will contaminate their fresh water supply.I had a meeting with the president there,who told me about hisexit strategy for his country.He expects that within the next 50 years,the 100,000 people that live therewill have to relocate toNew Zealand or Australia.And that made me think about how would I feelif Britain was going to disappear under the waves;if the places where I&#39;d been bornand gone to schooland got married,if all those places were just going to disappear forever.How, literally, ungroundedthat would make me feel.

en:Very shortly, I&#39;ll be setting out to try and get to Australia,and if I&#39;m successful, I&#39;ll be the first woman ever to row soloall the way across the Pacific.And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues,to bring a human face to the ocean.If the Atlantic was about my inner journey,discovering my own capabilities,maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey,figuring out how I can usemy interesting career choiceto be of service to the world,and to take some of those things that I&#39;ve learned out thereand apply them to the situationthat humankind now finds itself in.

zh-cn:我认为有三个关键问题第一个关键是我们对自己的认识在很长的时间里,我一直都认为自己不能去冒险因为我没有六英尺高也不好运动,而且也没胡子但是后来,这些看法都改变了我发现像我这样的人也有横渡大洋的我甚至见过其中一位,她和我的个头差不多所以我就想尽管我不能长得更高我也不可能再长胡子但我还是可以改变的,我的内心世界改变了我们都一致的认为我们需要材料我们需要石油但是如果我们改变我们的想法呢？我们当然还有别的选择我们当然可以自由选择另外的一些可持续发展的原料创造更加绿色的未来
en:I think there are probably three key points here.The first one is aboutthe stories that we tell ourselves.For so long, I told myselfthat I couldn&#39;t have an adventurebecause I wasn&#39;t six foot talland athletic and bearded.And then that story changed.I found out that people had rowed across oceans.I even met one of them and she was just about my size.So even though I didn&#39;t grow any taller,I didn&#39;t sprout a beard,something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselvesis that we need all this stuff,that we need oil.But what about if we just change that story?We do have alternatives,and we have the power of free willto choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones,to create a greener future.
时间：14:26
zh-cn:第二个关键是这些细微行动的积累我们一般认为我们所做的这些是纯属个人行为如九牛一毛，这些行动也不会带来任何改变但是，它们确实能带来改变我们还没有陷入大灾难带来的混乱中尽管发生过埃克森瓦尔德斯事故和切尔诺贝利核泄漏事件但它们主要是由无数人的日复一日，年复一年的错误决定积累造成的寄于同样的原因，我们可以改变形势我们要开始做出更好更明智、更有利于可持续发展的决定当我们那样做的时候，我们不再是一个人我们所做的任何事情都是为了造成影响其它的人会看到，你在超市排队时拿出了重复使用的购物袋如果我们所有人开始做这么做也许我们能让全社会拒绝结账时使用塑料袋这只是一个例子世界是一个大家庭
en:The second point is aboutthe accumulation of tiny actions.We might think that anything that we do as an individualis just a drop in the ocean, that it can&#39;t really make a difference.But it does. Generally, we haven&#39;tgot ourselves into this mess through big disasters.Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezesand the Chernobyls,but mostly it&#39;s been an accumulationof bad decisionsby billions of individuals,day after day and year after year.And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.We can start making better,wiser, more sustainable decisions.And when we do that, we&#39;re not just one person.Anything that we do spreads ripples.Other people will see if you&#39;re in the supermarket lineand you pull out yourreusable grocery bag.Maybe if we all start doing this,we can make it socially unacceptableto say yes to plastic in the checkout line.That&#39;s just one example.This is a world-wide community.
时间：15:25
zh-cn:另外的一个关键问题是关于承担责任的问题我在生活的大部分时间里都努力使自己高兴我曾认为如果我有称心房子、满意的轿车或对的人我就会心满意足但是，当我为自己写讣告的时候我发现自己在那一刻成熟了许多我意识到我要自己创造未来我不能够消极地等待幸福自己找上门来我假想自己是一名自私的环境专家我打算长期致力于此项工作当我90岁的时候我希望自己健康快乐然而如果我们居住的星球满目疮痍，充满了饥荒和干旱我们很难会找到快乐如果我们的星球到处是受污染的土壤海水和空气我们无法维持健康
en:The other point:It&#39;s about taking responsibility.For so much of my life,I wanted something else to make me happy.I thought if I had the right house or the right caror the right man in my life,then I could be happy.But when I wrote that obituary exercise,I actually grew up a little bit in that momentand realized that I needed to create my own future.I couldn&#39;t just wait passivelyfor happiness to come and find me.And I suppose I&#39;m a selfish environmentalist.I plan on being around for a long time,and when I&#39;m 90 years old,I want to be happy and healthy.And it&#39;s very difficult to be happyon a planet that&#39;s rackedwith famine and drought.It&#39;s very difficult to be healthy on a planetwhere we&#39;ve poisoned the earthand the sea and the air.

zh-cn:简单地说，我打算发起一项新的行动它叫做生态英雄这项运动倡导我们所有的生态英雄们每天至少做一件绿色环保的事情它有点像游戏我们打算以此来制作一个iPhone软件我们只是努力地创造那人们的环保意识因为，当然了，更换一个灯泡并不会改变世界但是，那种促使你去换这个灯泡或自带可重复使用咖啡杯的环保意识和环保态度却可以改变世界
en:So, shortly, I&#39;m going to belaunching a new initiativecalled Eco-Heroes.And the idea here is thatall our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.It&#39;s meant to be a bit of a game.We&#39;re going to make an iPhone app out of it.We just want to try and create that awarenessbecause, sure, changing a light bulb isn&#39;t going to change the world,but that attitude,that awareness that leads you to change the light bulbor take your reusable coffee mug,that is what could change the world.

zh-cn:我确信我们所处的历史时期是非常关键的一个阶段我们面临一个选择。我们会被保佑还是会被诅咒，完全凭我们自己的意志我们可以选择一个更加绿色的未来如果我们团结一心、齐心协力，我们就可实现这个目标
en:I really believe that we standat a very important point in history.We have a choice. We&#39;ve been blessed,or cursed, with free will.We can choose a greener future,and we can get thereif we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time.
