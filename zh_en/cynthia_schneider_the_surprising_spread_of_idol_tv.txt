zh-cn:我想问一下大家以下这三个人有什么共同之处?你们可能都认得第一位我相信你们都是&quot;美国偶像&quot;的忠实观众你们也许不认识Aydah Al Jahani她是一位参赛选手，实际上她是“百万诗人”比赛的决赛选手这档节目不仅在阿卜杜比播出在整个阿拉伯世界都有观众这个比赛要求选手创作并朗诵原创诗歌，且为纳巴蒂体这是一种传统的贝都因部落的诗歌形式Lima Sahar也是一位决赛选手她参加的是&quot;阿富汗之星&quot;歌唱比赛
en:I&#39;d like to ask you,what do these three people have in common?Well, you probably recognize the first person.I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all avid &quot;American Idol&quot; watchers.But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani,who is a contestant, indeed a finalist,in the Poet of the Millions competition,which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi,and seen throughout the Arab world.In this contestpeople have to write and reciteoriginal poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry,which is the traditional Bedouin form.And Lima Sahar was a finalistin the Afghan Star singing competition.

zh-cn:在我继续之前是的，我知道&quot;英国达人&quot;是此类节目的鼻祖但我所说的重点是想向大家说明— 希望我可以讲清楚这些比拼才艺的竞赛人人均可参与通过短信投票选出胜者它们如何改变部落社会我将以阿富汗和阿拉伯世界的阿联酋为例他们改变部落社会的方法并不是通过引入西方思想而是通过融合各部落的语言
en:Now, before I go any further,yes, I know it all began with &quot;Britain&#39;s Got Talent.&quot;But my point in discussing thisis to show you — I hope I&#39;ll be able to show youhow these merit-based competitions,with equal access to everyone,with the winner selected via voting by SMS,are changing tribal societies.And I&#39;m going to focus on Afghanistanand the Arab world with the UAE,how they&#39;re changing tribal societies,not by introducing Western ideas,but by being integrated into the language in those places.

zh-cn:一切以娱乐开始我们来不及看&quot;阿富汗之星&quot;了我们要看&quot;阿富汗之星&quot; 已经晚了我们要晚了我们一定要去看&quot;阿富汗之星&quot;这些节目已经深入人心在阿富汗，人们不远数里为了能够看到这个节目自家没有电视也没有关系全国上下都在收看这一节目甚至在公共场所都有得看但不仅仅是观看这么简单因为，其中的一部分是拉选票人人参与甚至还有志愿者，类似政治选举的志愿者他们跑遍全国上下为他们支持的选手拉票选手们也主动推销自己
en:It all begins with enjoyment.Video: We are late to watch &quot;Afghan Star.&quot;We are going to watch &quot;Afghan Star.&quot; We are late.We are running late.We must go to watch &quot;Afghan Star.&quot;Cynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society.In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengthsto be able to watch this program.And you don&#39;t necessarily have to have your own TV set.People watch it all over the countryalso in public places.But it goes beyond watching,because also, part of thisis campaigning.People become so engagedthat they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway,who fan out over the countryside,campaigning for their candidate.Contestants also put themselves forward.

zh-cn:当然，一些人只把选票投给来自本地区的选手，但并非完全如此因为每年的冠军都来自不同的部落谁都可以报名参赛尤其是对于女性来说上一个赛季，有两位女选手闯入了决赛其中一位的Lima Sahar是普什图族人，来自坎大哈一个非常保守的地区在&quot;阿富汗之星&quot;的记录片中，她告诉我们她的朋友们劝她不要参赛说她为了民主背离了他们但同时她透露她知道有塔利班基地组织成员发短信为她投票
en:Now, of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely.Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group.This has opened up the door,particularly for women.And in the last season there were two women in the finalists.One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar,a very conservative part of the country.And here she relates, in the documentary film &quot;Afghan Star,&quot;how her friends urged her not to do thisand told her that she was leaving them for democracy.But she also confides thatshe knows that members of the Talibanare actually SMS-ing votes in for her.

zh-cn:Aydah Al Jahnani也是冒风险去参加“百万诗人”的比赛我必须说，她的丈夫从一开始就支持她但是她的部落和家庭都不支持甚至极力反对她参加但当她开始赢得比赛时他们就开始支持她了看来竞争和好胜是全人类的价值取向她参加比赛写的诗歌是关于女性以及社会中妇女生活情况的仅仅通过展现自己和男性同台竞技从节目的投票结果可以看出她为年轻女性做出了很好的榜样节目观众中有年轻女性在阿卜杜比，还有电视机前的观众
en:Aydah Al Jahnani also took risksand put herself out, to competein the Poet of the Millions competition.I have to say, her husband backed her from the start.But her tribe and family urged her not to competeand were very much against it.But, once she started to win,then they got behind her again.It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.And she&#39;s out there.Her poetry is about women,and the life of women in society.So just by presenting herselfand being in competition with men —this shows the voting on the program —it sets a very important example for young women —these are young women in the audience of the program —in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.

zh-cn:你们可能认为&quot;美国偶像&quot;会带来美国化的潮流但事实却恰恰相反通过全民动员的形式弘扬传统本土文化实际上促使海湾地区人民重拾对纳巴蒂体诗歌的关注传统服饰、舞蹈、音乐也开始得到复兴在阿富汗塔利班管制音乐已多年这个活动重新向人们介绍了他们的传统音乐他们不唱流行歌曲他们唱阿富汗民歌他们也开始学会体面地接受失败而不是对胜出者进行报复(笑声)样样都很重要
en:Now you&#39;d think that &quot;American Idol&quot;would introduce a measure of Americanization.But actually, just the opposite is happening.By using this engaging popular formatfor traditional, local culture,it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revivalof interest in Nabati poetry,also in traditional dress and dance and music.And for Afghanistan,where the Taliban banned music for many years,it is reintroducing their traditional music.They don&#39;t sing pop songs,they sing Afghan music.And they also have learned how to lose gracefully,without avenging the winner.(Laughter)No small thing.

zh-cn:最后，一种终极版的“美国偶像”形式的节目在阿富汗新鲜出炉这档节目叫做“候选人”在节目中，人们提出政策主张，然后进行投票虽然许多参赛选手太年轻，不能竞选总统但通过提出提议他们影响着总统竞选对我来说，潜在的意义是看真人秀节目如何影响现实谢谢（掌声）
en:And the final, sort of, formulationof this &quot;American Idol&quot; format,which has just appeared in Afghanistan,is a new program called &quot;The Candidate.&quot;And in this program, people presentpolicy platforms that are then voted on.Many of them are too young to run for president,but by putting the issues out there,they are influencing the presidential race.So for me, the substance of things unseenis how reality TV is driving reality.Thank you.(Applause)
