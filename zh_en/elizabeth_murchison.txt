zh-cn:每个人都熟悉癌症但我们通常认为癌症不是传染病袋獾（又称塔斯马尼亚恶魔）已经向我们证实癌症不但可能是传染病也可能导致整个一个物种灭绝
en:Everyone&#39;s familiar with cancer,but we don&#39;t normally think of canceras being a contagious disease.The Tasmanian devil has shown usthat, not only can cancer be a contagious disease,but it can also threatenan entire species with extinction.

zh-cn:首先，袋獾是什么？很多人可能熟悉塔斯这个卡通形象（华纳兄弟－Looney Tunes）一直不停转圈的那个但很多人并不知道确实有一种动物叫塔斯马尼亚恶魔（袋獾）这是世界上最大的肉食性有袋动物有袋动物是一种身前有口袋的哺乳动物比如袋鼠袋獾被称作塔斯马尼亚恶魔是因为它们在夜间发出吓人的尖叫声
en:So first of all, what is a Tasmanian devil?Many of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character,the one that spins around and around and around.But not many people knowthat there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil,and it&#39;s the world&#39;s largest carnivorous marsupial.A marsupial is a mammal with a pouchlike a kangaroo.The Tasmanian devil got its namefrom the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.

zh-cn:袋獾主要食腐肉它们用有利的下颌骨和尖利的牙齿啃食腐烂动物尸体的骨头袋獾只分布在塔斯马尼亚岛这是一个在澳洲大陆南边的小岛虽然袋獾的面孔有点吓人但它们其实是很可爱的小动物我本人在塔斯马尼亚岛长大能在野外看到袋獾一直是件令人兴奋的事情
en:The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger,and it uses its powerful jawsand its sharp teethto chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania,which is that small islandjust to the south of the mainland of Australia.And despite their ferocious appearance,Tasmanian devils are actuallyquite adorable little animals.In fact, growing up in Tasmania,it always was incredibly excitingwhen we got a chance to seea Tasmanian devil in the wild.

zh-cn:但袋獾数量呈急速下降的趋势很多人担心这个物种可能将在二三十年内消失殆尽原因就是一种新疾病的出现一种传染性癌症
en:But the Tasmanian devil populationhas been undergoing a really extremely fast decline.And in fact, there&#39;s concernthat the species could go extinct in the wildwithin 20 to 30 years.And the reason for thatis the emergence of a new disease,a contagious cancer.

zh-cn:事情始于1996年一位野外摄影师拍下了这张袋獾的照片它的脸部有个巨大的肿瘤当时这被认为是个个例动物，和人一样有时会长出奇形怪状的肿瘤但是，如今我们发现那是这种新型疾病的初露端倪现在已经肆虐整个塔斯马尼亚岛这种新型疾病首先于1996年在塔斯马尼亚岛北部发现然后大规模波及到整个岛如今只剩下群体的小部分还未被感染
en:The story begins in 1996when a wildlife photographer took this photograph hereof a Tasmanian devilwith a large tumor on its face.At the time, this was thought to be a one-off.Animals, just like humans,sometimes get strange tumors.However, we now believethat this is the first sighting of a new disease,which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania.The disease was first sightedin the northeast of Tasmania in 1996and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave.Now there&#39;s only a small part of the population,which remains unaffected.

zh-cn:这种病首先表现为肿瘤通常出现在袋獾的脸部或口腔内这些肿瘤最终长成大块的肿瘤比如这样的下一张图片比较恶心最终，这些肿瘤不断繁殖，溃烂的肿瘤就像这样
en:This disease appears first as tumors,usually on the face or inside the mouthof affected Tasmanian devils.These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors,such as these ones here.And the next image I&#39;m going to showis quite gruesome.But inevitably, these tumors progresstowards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here.

zh-cn:这个病例我一直记忆犹新因为这是我接触的第一个病例我仍然记得当时看到这个嘴里长着溃烂并发出恶臭的大肿瘤的袋獾时受到的惊吓实际上它的整个下巴因为这个肿瘤已经脱开几天没有进食腹中大量寄生虫繁殖整个身体因为次发性肿瘤已经千疮百孔然而它还得喂养袋里三个嗷嗷待哺的小袋獾毫无疑问，小袋獾和妈妈一起死掉了他们太幼小无法独立生存事实上，在这只袋獾的生活区域那里百分之九十以上的袋獾都已经死于这种病
en:This one in particular sticks in my mind,because this is the first case of this diseasethat I saw myself.And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devilwith this huge ulcerating, foul-smelling tumorinside her mouththat had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw.She hadn&#39;t eaten for days.Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms.Her body was riddled with secondary tumors.And yet, she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devilsin her pouch.Of course, they died along with the mother.They were too young to survive without their mother.In fact, in the area where she comes from,more than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil populationhas already died of this disease.

zh-cn:世界上的科学家开始研究这种癌症这种在整个袋獾群体中传播的传染性癌症我们首先立刻想到了子宫颈癌这是通过病毒传播还有艾滋病感染者可能患上几种不同的癌症所有证据都表明这种癌症是通过病毒传播然而现在我们知道－我正要告诉你们的－是这种癌症并不是通过病毒传播事实上，该癌症的传播病原体是更险恶的东西一种完全出乎意料的东西为了更好地解释此内容先让我花上几分钟谈谈癌症本身
en:Scientists around the worldwere intrigued by this cancer,this infectious cancer,that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population.And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women,which is spread by a virus,and to the AIDS epidemic,which is associated with a number of different types of cancer.All the evidence suggested that this devil cancerwas spread by a virus.However, we now know — and I&#39;ll tell you right now —that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus.In fact, the infectious agent of disease in this canceris something altogether more sinister,and something that we hadn&#39;t really thought of before.But in order for me to explain what that is,I need to spend just a couple of minutestalking more about cancer itself.

zh-cn:每年全世界有上百万人患上癌症这个屋子里的人有三分之一会在未来患上不同程度的癌症我14岁的时候就从大肠摘除了一个肿瘤当你体内的一个细胞上的重要基因发生一系列的偶发突变这个细胞开始不断自我增殖癌症就产生了然后，一旦上述情况发生自然选择的规律却使癌症不断长大自然选择是适者生存在一群快速分裂的癌细胞中如果一个细胞获得新的突变从而更快的繁殖更好的吸收营养侵入机体他们则被自然保留
en:Cancer is a diseasethat affects millions of people around the world every year.One in three people in this roomwill develop cancer at some stage in their lives.I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestinewhen I was only 14.Cancer occurswhen a single cell in your bodyacquires a set of random mutations in important genesthat cause that cell to start to producemore and more and more copies of itself.Paradoxically, once established,natural selection actually favorsthe continued growth of cancer.Natural selection is survival of the fittest.And when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells,if one of them acquires new mutations,which allow them to grow more quickly,acquire nutrients more successfully,invade the body,they&#39;ll be selected for by evolution.

zh-cn:所以癌症是非常难以治疗的疾病它会进化进行药物治疗抗药性的细胞会卷土重来令人不可思议的是如果给以适当的环境和营养一个癌细胞可以无限繁殖然而癌症也受制于它寄生的身体癌细胞不断生长遍布整个身体吞噬掉组织最后导致癌细胞的寄主死亡的同时也是癌细胞自己的末日
en:That&#39;s why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.It evolves.Throw a drug at it,and resistant cells will grow back.An amazing fact is that,given the right environment and the right nutrients,a cancer cell has the potentialto go on growing forever.However cancer is constrainedby living inside our bodies,and its continued growth,its spreading through our bodiesand eating away at our tissues,leads to the death of the cancer patientand also to the death of the cancer itself.

zh-cn:所以癌症可以被看作一个奇怪的，短命的，自我毁灭性的生命形式进化的死胡同但是袋獾的癌细胞具备一种令人无比惊奇的进化适应能力通过研究袋獾癌症的DNA我们找到了答案这是很多人工作的结果但是将通过几年前我做的一个验证试验来向各位解释
en:So cancer could be thought ofas a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form —an evolutionary dead end.But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancerhas acquired an absolutely amazingevolutionary adaptation.And the answer came from studyingthe Tasmanian devil cancer&#39;s DNA.This was work from many people,but I&#39;m going to explain it through a confirmatory experimentthat I did a few years ago.

zh-cn:下张幻灯片会比较恶心这是乔纳斯我们发现它的脸上有一个大肿瘤作为遗传学家我一直对DNA及其突变感兴趣所以我借此机会收集了一样乔纳斯肿瘤的样本和他身体其他部位的样本带回实验室我从样本上提取了DNA当我完成DNA测序并将肿瘤的测序结果和身体其他部分的测序结果对比时我发现两者的基因图谱完全不同实际上，乔纳斯和它的肿瘤就像你和你旁边的人一样完全不同这就告诉我们乔纳斯的肿瘤并不是来自它的身体更多的基因图谱告诉我们乔纳斯的肿瘤可能最先来自于一个雌袋獾而乔纳斯是雄性
en:The next slide is going to be gruesome.This is Jonas.He&#39;s a Tasmanian devil that we foundwith a large tumor on his face.And being a geneticist,I&#39;m always interested to look at DNA and mutations.So I took this opportunityto collect some samples from Jonas&#39; tumorand also some samples from other parts of his body.I took these back to the lab.I extracted DNA from them.And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA,and compared the sequence of Jonas&#39; tumorto that of the rest of his body,I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile.In fact, Jonas and his tumorwere as different from each otheras you and the person sitting next to you.What this told us was that Jonas&#39; tumordid not arise from cells of his own body.In fact, more genetic profilingtold us that this tumor in Jonasactually probably first arosefrom the cells of a female Tasmanian devil —and Jonas was clearly a male.

zh-cn:所以一个来自另一个体的细胞是如何长到乔纳斯脸上去的？下一个研究突破来自于塔斯马尼亚岛上成千只袋獾的癌细胞研究我们发现所有的癌细胞具有一样的DNA这意味着什么？意味着所有的癌细胞实际上是同一个癌细胞从第一个袋獾个体上产生的癌症突破了单个个体的限制传播到了整个袋獾群体
en:So how comea tumor that arose from the cells of another individualis growing on Jonas&#39; face?Well the next breakthroughcame from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancersfrom all around Tasmania.We found that all of these cancersshared the same DNA.Think about that for a minute.That means that all of these cancersactually are the same cancerthat arose once from one individual devil,that have broken free of that first devil&#39;s bodyand spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population.
时间： 8:30
zh-cn:那一个癌症是怎么在群体中扩散的？揭开谜题最后答案的是袋獾在野外相遇时的行为方式它们会咬对方通常会很激烈，并且常常是咬脸部我们认为癌细胞从肿瘤进入唾液当袋獾相互撕咬时癌细胞就被植入另一个袋獾体内从而肿瘤得以继续生存所以袋獾癌症可能是终极版癌症它不受产生个体的限制可以在群体中传播并通过突变侵入免疫系统这是唯一一个我们目前知道的能导致一个物种整体灭绝的癌症
en:But how can a cancer spread in a population?Well the final piece of the puzzle camewhen we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild.They tend to bite each other,often quite ferociously and usually on the face.We think that cancer cellsactually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.When the devil bites another devil,it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil,so the tumor continues to grow.So this Tasmanian devil canceris perhaps the ultimate cancer.It&#39;s not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.It spreads through the population,has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system,and it&#39;s the only cancer that we know ofthat&#39;s threatening an entire species with extinction.

zh-cn:但是如果这种癌症见于袋獾为什么没有发生在其他动物身上甚至是人类？答案是，确实有过。这是金波它的主人住在肯尼亚的蒙巴萨去年，它的主人发现它的生殖器官区域开始滴血她带着金波去看兽医兽医发现些很恶心的东西如果你比较敏感，请转头看别处兽医发现了这个一个很大的滴血的肿瘤长在金波的阴茎上兽医诊断为一种传染性生殖道肿瘤一种犬类间传染的性病正如同袋獾的癌症通过癌细胞活体传播这只狗的癌症也是
en:But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils,why hasn&#39;t it happened in other animalsor even humans?Well the answer is, it has.This is Kimbo.He&#39;s a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya.Last year, his owner noticed some bloodtrickling from his genital region.She took him to the vetand the vet discovered something quite disgusting.And if you&#39;re squeamish, please look away now.He discovered this,a huge bleeding tumorat the base of Kimbo&#39;s penis.The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor,a sexually transmitted cancerthat affects dogs.And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagiousthrough the spread of living cancer cells,so is this dog cancer.
时间：10:08
zh-cn:但这只狗的更厉害因为它已经传播到全世界事实上，金波感染的这种癌细胞也出现于纽约的狗身上喜马拉雅山区村子里狗的身上还有澳大利亚的内陆我们认为这种癌症很久历史了基因图谱告诉我们它有几万年之久这意味着它可能最初来自一个生活在尼安德特人年代的狼身上这个癌症十分厉害这是我们目前所之的最古老的哺乳动物源性生命体这是从遥远上古活下来的遗迹
en:But this dog cancer is quite remarkable,because it spread all around the world.And in fact, these same cellsthat are affecting Kimbo hereare also found affecting dogsin New York City,in mountain villages in the Himalayasand in Outback Australia.We also believe this cancer might be very old.In fact, genetic profiling tellsthat it may be tens of thousands of years old,which means that this cancermay have first arisenfrom the cells of a wolfthat lived alongside the Neanderthals.This cancer is remarkable.It&#39;s the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.It&#39;s a living relicof the distant past.

zh-cn:我们了解到动物感染的情况那在人类间传播的癌症呢？这个问题引起切斯特･索伦医生的极大兴趣他是50年代的一个癌症医生他决定通过对人体进行实际注射癌细胞来进行试验这是索伦医生于1957的照片他正给一个志愿者注射癌细胞这个志愿者是俄亥俄州管教所的一个犯人索伦医生注射过的大部分人并没有因为注射的癌细胞患上癌症但是一小部分得了患癌这些人大部分也会生病因为他们的免疫系统估计早败下阵来
en:So we&#39;ve seen that this can happen in animals.Could cancers be contagious between people?Well this is a questionwhich fascinated Chester Southam,a cancer doctor in the 1950s.Ad he decided to put this to the testby actually deliberately inoculating peoplewith cancer from somebody else.And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957injecting cancer into a volunteer,who in this case was an inmatein Ohio State Penitentiary.Most of the people that Dr. Southam injecteddid not go on to develop cancerfrom the injected cells.But a small number of them did,and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill —whose immune systems were probably compromised.

zh-cn:这告诉我们不追究道德问题的话就是（笑声）是人之间传播的癌症是非常罕见的但是，在某些情况下仍然可能发生我认为这是肿瘤学家和流行病学家将来要关注的问题
en:What this tells us,ethical issues aside,is that ...(Laughter)it&#39;s probably extremely rarefor cancers to be transferred between people.However, under some circumstances,it can happen.And I think that this is somethingthat oncologists and epidemiologistsshould be aware of in the future.

zh-cn:最后癌症是细胞分化并适应环境的必然结果但是这不意味着我们在与癌症的斗争中毫无希望我相信，在掌握更多的关于癌细胞生长的复杂进化过程的知识后我们可以打败癌症我的个人目标是打败袋獾癌症让我们共同努力不让袋獾成为第一个因癌症灭绝的物种
en:So just finally,cancer is an inevitable outcomeof the ability of our cellsto divideand to adapt to their environments.But that does not mean that we should give up hopein the fight against cancer.In fact, I believe, given more knowledgeof the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer&#39;s growth,we can defeat cancer.My personal aimis to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer.Let&#39;s prevent the Tasmanian devilfrom being the first animalto go extinct from cancer.
