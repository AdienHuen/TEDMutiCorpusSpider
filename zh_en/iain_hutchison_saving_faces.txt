zh-cn:我们的面部十分重要因为它是身体外部可视的部分所有人都可以看见。我们别忘了它也是一个功能实体。我们有坚固的头盖骨用来保护我们身体中最重要的器官:大脑。我们感官也位于面部,我们的一些特殊感官 —我们的视觉,我们的言语,我们的听力,我们的嗅觉,我们的味觉。这块骨头布满了 正如你看到的 穿透过头盖骨的光线还有空腔, 鼻窦,使我们吸入的空气变的温暖和湿润。但想象一下,如果这全是实心的骨头,我们的头会变得非常重,我们将不能抬起头,我们也不能看到我们四周的世界。这个女人正在慢慢的死去因为她面颅骨里的良性肿瘤已经彻底毁坏了她的嘴巴和鼻子,所以她不能呼吸也不能吃东西。
en:Our face is hugely importantbecause it&#39;s the external, visual partthat everybody else sees.Let&#39;s not forget it&#39;s a functional entity.We have strong skull bonesthat protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.It&#39;s where our senses are located, our special senses —our vision, our speech,our hearing, our smell, our taste.And this boneis peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skullwith cavities, the sinuses,which warm and moisten the air we breathe.But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone —our head would be dead weight,we wouldn&#39;t be able to hold it erect,we wouldn&#39;t be able to look at the world around us.This woman is slowly dyingbecause the benign tumors in her facial boneshave completely obliterated her mouth and her noseso she can&#39;t breathe and eat.

zh-cn:依附于面颅骨用来勾画我们面部结构的是传递我们面部表情的肌肉,我们通用的表情语言我们的社会信号体系。覆盖其上的是皮肤褶皱，它是个极其复杂的三维结构 —在这里那里会有各种角度的弯折有薄如眼睑的区域，有厚如脸颊的区域和不同的颜色组成。我们的脸上也有官能要素。我们喜欢亲吻别人什么地方?嘴唇上。也许在耳边轻咬。这正是因为我们被面部所吸引。
en:Attached to the facial bonesthat define our face&#39;s structureare the muscles that deliver our facial expression,our universal language of expression,our social-signaling system.And overlying this is the skin drape,which is a hugely complexthree-dimensional structure —taking right-angled bends here and there,having thin areas like the eyelids,thick areas like the cheek, different colors.And then we have the sensual factor of the face.Where do we like to kiss people?On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe.It&#39;s the face where we&#39;re attracted to with that.

zh-cn:不过我们也不要忘记头发。你现在看一下你左手边的图片 —这是我儿子有眉毛的照片，而他没有眉毛的照片看起来是不是很奇怪。这有着决定性的差异。想象一下他如果从鼻子中间有毛发他会看起来更加奇怪。
en:But let&#39;s not forget the hair.You&#39;re looking at the image on your left-hand side —that&#39;s my son with his eyebrows present.Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing.There&#39;s a definite difference.And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose,he&#39;d look even odder still.

zh-cn:曲影症是一个事实的极端特例我们看我们自己和别人看我们是不同的。这是个让人震惊的事实我们只能看到我们的镜像，我们只能看到我们自己在定格的照片中这些照片只能捕获我们生活中的短暂瞬间。曲影症是这一事实的反常行为有些相貌很好看的人认为自己面目狰狞并且不断寻求通过手术来矫正他们的容貌。他们并不需要手术, 他们需要心理辅导。马克斯好心的把他的照片捐赠给我。他没有曲影症，但我用他的照片来说明他看起来跟一个曲影症患者一样。换句话说，他看起来完全正常。
en:Dysmorphophobiais an extreme versionof the fact that we don&#39;t see ourselvesas others see us.It&#39;s a shocking truththat we only see mirror images of ourselves,and we only see ourselvesin freeze-frame photographic imagesthat capture a mere fraction of the time that we live.Dysmorphophobiais a perversion of thiswhere people who may be very good lookingregard themselves as hideously uglyand are constantly seeking surgeryto correct their facial appearance.They don&#39;t need this. They need psychiatric help.Max has kindly donated his photograph to me.He doesn&#39;t have dysmorphophobia, but I&#39;m using his photographto illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic.In other words, he looks entirely normal.

zh-cn:年龄是另外一个因素在我们对待自己容貌态度的改变之中。所以孩子们自我衡量，学习自我衡量是通过他们身边成年人的行为。这是个经典案例:丽贝卡的良性血管瘤从她的头骨中长出来，并且毁坏了她的鼻子，她看东西已经成问题。你可以看到，肿瘤阻挡了她的视线。如果她弄破了肿瘤她的生命也会因为大出血而有危险。我们的研究表明这些孩子们的父母和亲近的人们极其喜欢他们。他们已经习惯了这些孩子们的脸；他们觉得这些孩子很特殊。其实，有的时候父母们会讨论是不是要把这些孩子的病变除去。偶尔的，他们会难过因为他们心爱的孩子会有如此大的变化以至于都不能认出他们来了。但另外的成年人会说一些让人难以置信的心痛的话。他们会说，“你们怎么敢把这个孩子带出家门这会吓到其他人的。你们难道不应该做些什么么? 为什么不把这些病变除去？”其他的孩子们会好奇的上来戳一戳，因为一种自然的好奇心。这当然会让这个孩子意识到他不寻常的特质。手术之后，一切归于正常。大人们的举动更自然，这些孩子和其他孩子也更玩的来。
en:Age is another thingwhen our attitude toward our appearance changes.So children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves,by the behavior of adults around them.Here&#39;s a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumorthat&#39;s growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose,and she&#39;s having difficulty seeing.As you can see, it&#39;s blocking her vision.She&#39;s also in danger, when she damages this,of bleeding profusely.Our research has shownthat the parents and close loved ones of these childrenadore them.They&#39;ve grown used to their face; they think they&#39;re special.Actually, sometimes the parents argueabout whether these children should have the lesion removed.And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactionsbecause the child they&#39;ve grown to lovehas changed so dramatically and they don&#39;t recognize them.But other adultssay incredibly painful things.They say, &quot;How dare you take this child out of the houseand terrify other people.Shouldn&#39;t you be doing something about this? Why haven&#39;t you had it removed?&quot;And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion,because — a natural curiosity.And that obviously alerts the childto their unusual nature.After surgery, everything normalizes.The adults behave more naturally,and the children play more readily with other children.

zh-cn:作为青少年—回想一下你们的青少年时期—我们经历着戏剧性的时常是不成比例的面部变化。我们努力的寻找自己的身份我们渴望得到同龄人的认可。所以我们的面容对我们来说极其重要当我们努力的向世界展现自己。还记得吗？一个青春痘就可以让你好几天都精神萎靡。你每天花多长时间盯着镜子，练习讽刺的表情，严肃的表情，尝试看起来更像肖恩·康纳利，像我小时候一样。尝试着扬起一只眉毛。那是个让人束手无策的时期。
en:As teenagers —just think back to your teenage years —we&#39;re going through a dramaticand often disproportionate changein our facial appearance.We&#39;re trying to struggle to find our identity.We crave the approval of our peers.So our facial appearance is vital to usas we&#39;re trying to project ourselves to the world.Just remember that single acne spotthat crippled you for several days.How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day,practicing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look,trying to look like Sean Connery, as I did,trying to raise one eyebrow?It&#39;s a crippling time.

zh-cn:我选择给你们看苏的侧面像，因为这样可以看出来她的下颚向前凸出她的下唇也向前凸出。我想让你们在座的每一位现在把你们的下颚推向前，然后转向旁边的人，把你们的下颚推向前，然后转向你旁边的人看着他们 — 他们看起来很忧愁。正如所有人告诉苏的一样。她一点也不忧愁。但是大家以前都会问她：“为什么你那么难过？”人们总是错误的判断她的情绪。她被老师和同学低估，在学校被取笑。所以她选择了面部手术。手术之后，她说：“现在我的脸是我的个性的写照。人们现在知道我很积极，我是个很幸福的人。”青少年们可以实现这样的改变。
en:I&#39;ve chosen to show this profile view of Suebecause what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forwardand her lower lip jutting forward.I&#39;d like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward.Turn to the person next to you,push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to youand look at them — they look miserable.That&#39;s exactly what people used to say to Sue.She wasn&#39;t miserable at all.But people used to say to her, &quot;Why are you so miserable?&quot;People were making misjudgments all the timeon her mood.Teachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school.So she chose to have facial surgery.After the facial surgery,she said, &quot;My face now reflects my personality.People know now that I&#39;m enthusiastic,that I&#39;m a happy person.&quot;And that&#39;s the change that can be achieved for teenagers.

zh-cn:这样的改变到底是真实的改变，还是只是虚构的病人自己的想象？我们考察青少年们对矫正面部手术患者照片的态度。我们发现 —我们把这些照片混杂在一起所以他们不能识别哪些是手术前那些是手术之后 —我们发现这些病人们在手术之后被认为更加有吸引力。这并不让人惊讶, 但我们继续让这些青少年们对诚信度，聪明程度,友善度,暴力程度进行评判。在手术之前的病人们都被认为在这些品质上不够正常比如更暴力,等等。手术之后，病人们被认为更聪明,更友好,更诚实,更平和 —可是我们并没有对他们的智力或者性格动手术。
en:Is this change, though, a real change,or is it a figment of the imaginationof the patient themselves?Well we studied teenagers&#39; attitudesto photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery.And what we found was —we jumbled up the photographsso they couldn&#39;t recognize the before and after —what we found was that the patients were regardedas being more attractive after the surgery.Well that&#39;s not surprising, but we also asked them to judge themon honesty, intelligence,friendliness, violence.They were all perceived as beingless than normal in all those characteristics —more violent, etc. — before the surgery.After the surgery,they were perceived as being more intelligent,more friendly, more honest, less violent —and yet we hadn&#39;t operated on their intellector their character.

zh-cn:当人们的年龄增长,他们不一定选择这类手术。他们对咨询室的光顾是被厄运打击的结果。他们正在经历的可能是癌症或者创伤的折磨。这是亨利的一张照片在他把恶性肿瘤从他左侧的脸上 - 他的颧骨,他的上颚和眼窝上切除几周之后照得。他这个时期看起来还不错。但是接下来的15年,他接受了14次手术,因为疾病毁了他的脸也毁了我定期对他面部的整容。我从亨利那里学到了很多东西。亨利告诉了我我还可以继续工作。他是个辩护律师。他还在继续打板球。他全心全意地享受生命。这可能因为他有一份成功的令他满意的工作一个充满关爱的家庭他也可以参与社会活动。他依旧镇定自若。我并不是说他战胜了肿瘤;他没有。但重要的是:他忽略了它。他忽略发生在他脸上的毁容他忘却疾病, 继续生活。这是这些人可以做到的。
en:When people get older,they don&#39;t necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery.Their presence in the consultation suiteis a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.What happens to themis that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.So this is a photograph of Henry,two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removedfrom the left side of his face — his cheekbone,his upper jaw, his eye-socket.He looks pretty good at this stage.But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations,as the disease ravaged his faceand destroyed my reconstruction regularly.I learned a huge amount from Henry.Henry taught methat you can carry on working.He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket.He enjoyed life to the full,and this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling joband a caring familyand was able to participate socially.He maintained a calm insouciance.I don&#39;t say he overcame this; he didn&#39;t overcome it.This was something more than that. He ignored it.He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his lifeand carried on oblivious to it.And that&#39;s what these people can do.

zh-cn:亨利阿皮也阐述了这个现象。这是个二十多岁的年轻尼日利亚男子他第一次出国是因为他的恶性肿瘤他需要到英国做手术。这是我最长的一次手术。历时23个小时。我跟我的神经外科医生一起。我们把他右脸的所有骨头都除去 —他的眼睛,鼻子,头骨,面部皮肤 —用他背部的组织给他整容。亨利阿皮继续着他精神科护士的工作。他结了婚,他的儿子叫耶利米。他说,“这幅我跟我儿子耶利米的画像告诉我我觉得到我是个成功的人。”他的面部畸形没有影响到他因为他有他家人的支持，他有一份成功的令他满足的工作。
en:Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well.This is a man in his 20swhose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancerthat he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on.It was my longest operation.It took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon.We removed all the bones at the right side of his face —his eye, his nose,the skull bones, the facial skin —and reconstructed him with tissue from the back.He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse.He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah.And again, he said,&quot;This painting of me with my son Jeremiahshows me as the successful man that I feel that I am.&quot;His facial disfigurementdid not affect himbecause he had the support of a family;he had a successful, fulfilling job.

zh-cn:所以我们看到我们可以改变这些人的面部。但当我们改变人们的面部时，我们同时也改变了他们的身份，这到底是好还是不好?比如说,有两种不同的面部手术。我们可以这样归类。我们可以说一种是病人选择进行面部手术 —正如苏.他们进行面部手术之后,感觉到他们的生活改变了,因为其他人认为他们是更好的人。他们本身并没感觉有什么不一样。但他们觉得他们获得了一些他们曾经没有的东西,他们的面部现在反映了他们的个性。这可能是整容手术和这些手术的不同之处。因为你可能会说，“这种手术也可以被认为是整容性质的。”如果你进行整容手术，病人们通常不会那么满意。整容手术病人想要改变生活。苏并没有想改变生活，她只是想让她的面部和她的个性相匹配。
en:So we&#39;ve seen that we can change people&#39;s faces.But when we change people&#39;s faces,are we changing their identity —for better or for worse?For instance,there are two different types of facial surgery.We can categorize it like that.We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery —like Sue.When they have facial surgery,they feel their lives have changedbecause other people perceive themas better people.They don&#39;t feel different.They feel that they&#39;ve actually gainedwhat they never had,that their face now reflects their personality.And actually that&#39;s probably the difference between cosmetic surgeryand this kind of surgery.Because you might say, &quot;Well, this type of surgerymight be regarded as cosmetic.&quot;If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy.They&#39;re trying to achieve difference in their lives.Sue wasn&#39;t trying to achieve difference in her life.She was just trying to achieve the facethat matched her personality.

zh-cn:也有其他一些人他们没有选择面部手术。这些人的面部被严重毁坏。我还是赶紧把图片移开，为了你们中感觉不舒服的人我们还是看着这张空白的幻灯片吧。但是他们被迫要做面部手术。正如我告诉你的，如果他们有个关心他们的家庭好的工作和生活，他们可以过正常和满意的生活。他们的身份并没有变化。
en:But then we have other peoplewho don&#39;t choose to have facial surgery.They&#39;re people who have their face shot off.I&#39;ll move it off, and we&#39;ll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you.They have it forced upon them.And again, as I told you,if they have a caring familyand good work life,then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.Their identity doesn&#39;t change.

zh-cn:这样的关于外表和对其专注的行业是一种西方的现象么？Muzetta一家的经历说明并不是这样的。这个住在伦敦东部的孟加拉国小女孩她右脸上巨大的恶性肿瘤，已经使她看不见东西，并且还在急速生长，在不久的将来会杀死她。在她手术移除肿瘤之后，她的父母给她穿上漂亮的绿色天鹅绒连衣裙，用粉色丝带装饰她的头发，他们希望全世界都可以看到这个画像，虽然他们是正统的穆斯林教徒她的母亲一直穿罩袍。所以这并不只是一个西方现象。
en:Is this businessabout appearance and preoccupation with ita Western phenomenon?Muzetta&#39;s family give the lie to this.This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of Londonwho&#39;s got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face,which has already made her blindand which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.After she had surgery to remove the tumor,her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress,a pink ribbon in her hair,and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world,despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslimsand the mother wore a full burqa.So it&#39;s not simply a Western phenomenon.

zh-cn:我们根据人的面部做判断每时每刻。从Lombrosso和他定义罪犯脸部方法开始。他说你可以只从照片就看出来哪些是罪犯的面孔。好看的人们总是会被认为更加友好。当我们看到O.J (O·J·辛普森) —他长的不错。我们愿意花时间和他相处。他看起来挺友善。我们现在知道他因为殴打他的妻子而判有罪，他其实并不是个好人。美貌并不等同于善良，更不等同于满足。
en:We make judgments on people&#39;s facesall the time.It&#39;s been going on since we can think of Lombrosoand the way he would define criminal faces.He said you could see criminal faces,judging them just on the photographs that were showed.Good-looking peopleare always judged as being more friendly.We look at O.J. —he&#39;s a good-looking guy.We&#39;d like to spend time with him. He looks friendly.Now we know that he&#39;s a convicted wife-batterer,and actually he&#39;s not the good guy.And beauty doesn&#39;t equate to goodness,and certainly doesn&#39;t equate to contentment.

zh-cn:我们谈了静态的面部和对静态面部的判断，事实上，我们更习惯于从动态的面部来判断。我们觉得我们可以从人们的表情进行判断。英国法律体系下的陪审员喜欢见到现场目击者这样他们可以看出来是否有泄露真相的迹象 —眨眼，犹豫。所以他们想见到现场目击人。托多罗夫告诉我们，只用十分之一秒，我们就可以根据他人的面部来做判断。我们对这个画面感觉的不舒服么？确实是这样。如果我们的医生，律师，金融顾问的脸被遮起来，我们会开心么?我们会挺不舒服的。但是我们能够很好的根据面部外观和活动做判断么？真实情况是有一个五分钟准则 —并不是托多罗夫所说的十分之一秒，但是是一个五分钟准则。如果你和某个人相处五分钟，你会开始注意到他们面部外观之外的地方，这些一开始吸引你的人可能会让你觉得很无聊，你对他们不再有兴趣，然后有些并没有立刻就引起你注意的人，因为你一开始并没觉得他们特别有吸引力，变得更加引人瞩目是因为他们的个性。
en:So we&#39;ve talked about the static faceand judging the static face,but actually, we&#39;re more comfortablewith judging the moving face.We think we can judge people on their expressions.U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice systemlike to see a live witnessto see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity —the blink, the hesitation.And so they want to see live witnesses.Todorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second,we can make a judgment on somebody&#39;s face.Are we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are.Would we be happy if our doctor&#39;s face, our lawyer&#39;s face,our financial adviser&#39;s face was covered?We&#39;d be pretty uncomfortable.But are we good at making the judgmentson facial appearance and movement?The truth is that there&#39;s a five-minute rule,not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule.If you spend five minutes with somebody,you start looking beyond their facial appearance,and the people who you&#39;re initially attracted tomay seem boring and you lose interest in them,and the people who you didn&#39;t immediately seek out,because you didn&#39;t find them particularly attractive,become attractive peoplebecause of their personality.

zh-cn:我们谈了一些面部外观。现在我想和你们分享一些我们做的手术 —我们现在和未来在做的手术。这是一幅安的图片她的右下颚和头骨底部被移除了。你可以看到手术后的图片，我们对她整形的很成功。但依旧不够好。安想要到外面去划皮划艇，她想去爬山。这些她曾经都做过，而这是我们现在需要努力的方向。
en:So we&#39;ve talked a lot about facial appearance.I now want to sharea little bit of the surgery that we do —where we&#39;re at and where we&#39;re going.This is an image of Annwho&#39;s had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed.And you can see in the images afterward,we&#39;ve managed to reconstruct her successfully.But that&#39;s not good enough.This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking,she wants to be out climbing mountains.And that&#39;s what she achieved, and that&#39;s what we have to get to.

zh-cn:这是一张恐怖的图片，所以我把我的手盖在上面。这是阿迪的一张照片，一位尼日利亚的银行经理，他的面部在一起持枪抢劫中被严重毁容。他失去了下颚，嘴唇，下巴还有上颚和牙齿。这是他对我们的期望。“我想看起来像这样。这是我以前的样子。”使用现代技术，我们用电脑做出模型。我们做了个无骨的的颚部模型。然后我们折弯一块薄板。放入适当的地方这样我们可以知道一个精确的位置。之后我们把骨头和组织放在其后。你可以看到薄板支撑着它，植入体正在被放进去—在一次手术之中我们做到了这个还有这个。这位病人恢复了正常生活。这是好消息。虽然如此，他下颚的皮肤看起来跟以前不一样。这是他背部的皮肤。所以更厚，颜色更深，更粗糙一些，也没有应有的轮廓。这些是我们不足的地方。这时候我们需要面部移植。
en:This is a horrific image,so I&#39;m putting my hand up now.This is a photograph of Adi,a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot offin an armed robbery.And he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chinand his upper jaw and teeth.This is the bar that he set for us.&quot;I want to look like this. This is how I looked before.&quot;So with modern technology,we used computers to make models.We made a model of the jaw without bone in it.We then bent a plate up to it.We put it in placeso we knew it was an accurate position.We then put bone and tissue from the back.Here you can see the plate holding it,and you can see the implants being put in —so that in one operationwe achieve thisand this.So the patient&#39;s life is restored.That&#39;s the good news.However, his chin skindoesn&#39;t look the same as it did before.It&#39;s skin from his back.It&#39;s thicker, it&#39;s darker, it&#39;s coarser, it doesn&#39;t have the contours.And that&#39;s where we&#39;re failing,and that&#39;s where we need the face transplant.

zh-cn:面部移植手术可能在更换烧伤病人的皮肤中扮演了一个重要角色。我们可以替换底层的骨骼结构，但是我们对面部皮肤的替换还很不足。所以在我们医疗设备中有这样的工具是十分重要的。可是病人们会终身需要服药用来抑制他们的免疫系统。这说明什么呢?他们会更可能被感染，有更大风险使病情恶化。这并不是一个挽救生命的移植 —比如心脏,肝脏,肺部移植 —这是一种生命质量的移植，移植的结果是这些病人们是不是会说，如果他们十年或者十五年后会罹患恶性肿瘤，“我还不如当时用常规的整容方法而不是用这个，因为我现在正在死于恶性肿瘤？”我们还不清楚。我们也不知道他们对此的认可度和认同有什么感受。首先尝试此类手术的伯纳德·德沃谢勒和塞尔维·泰斯特兰对他们进行了研究。接受手术的人不会很多，有多少人愿意自己关爱的人的脸部在他/她过世的时候被移除。所以会有很多的问题对于面部移植。
en:The face transplant has a roleprobably in burns patients to replace the skin.We can replace the underlying skeletal structure,but we&#39;re still not good at replacing the facial skin.So it&#39;s very valuableto have that tool in our armamentarium.But the patients are going to have to take drugsthat suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.What does that mean?They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.This is not a life-saving transplant —like a heart, or liver, or lung transplant —it is a quality-of-life transplant,and as a result,are the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on,&quot;I wish I&#39;d had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than thisbecause I&#39;m now dying of a malignant cancer&quot;? We don&#39;t know yet.We also don&#39;t know what they feelabout recognition and identity.Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin, who did the first operation,are studying that.Donors are going to be short on the ground,because how many people want to have their loved one&#39;s faceremoved at the point of death?So there are going to be problemswith face transplantation.

en:So the better news isthe future&#39;s almost here —and the future is tissue engineering.Just imagine,I can make a biologically-degradable template.I can put it in place where it&#39;s meant to be.I can sprinkle a few cells,stem cells from the patient&#39;s own hip,a little bit of genetically engineered protein,and lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown.This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe.

en:But we&#39;ve still got problems.We&#39;ve got mouth cancer to solve.We&#39;re still not curing enough patients — it&#39;s the most disfiguring cancer.We&#39;re still not reconstructing them well enough.In the U.K. we have an epidemicof facial injuries among young people.We still can&#39;t get rid of scars.We need to do research.And the best news of allis that surgeons knowthat we need to do research.And we&#39;ve set up charitiesthat will help us fundthe clinical researchto determine the best treatment practice nowand better treatment into the future,so we don&#39;t just sit on our laurels and say, &quot;Okay, we&#39;re doing okay.Let&#39;s leave it as it is.&quot;
