zh-cn:我今天不太想谈论简约主义那就把我的生活变得复杂些 让它严肃一点接下来 我会播放一些幻灯片先回到从前然后向你们展示我是如何一步一步走到这里
en:I&#39;m kind of tired of talking about simplicity, actually,so I thought I&#39;d make my life more complex, as a serious play.So, I&#39;m going to, like, go through some slidesfrom way back when,and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here.

zh-cn:其实一切都源于这一个概念 - 计算机.那谁有计算机呢? 嗯.好吧, 每个人都有自己的计算机甚至一部手机也算是台计算机那.. 谁还记得这本操作手册&quot;充分利用你的苹果电脑&quot; —每本书都附一张免费海报?然后计算就开始了别忘了：计算机刚诞生时，里面并没有软件.你买来它, 带它回家, 给它插上电源,结果它什么事情也做不了.因此, 你还得为它写点程序,要编程的话是有一些很棒的 教程 比如这个我想说它真的很棒这好象是 你知道的 ‘’Herbie教你学苹果二代‘’这种书真的很棒—我说 他们真应该把Java书也写成这样那学编程简直就易如反掌了当时对计算机来说可真是个好时候很原始 很初级 就像是 黄金时代然后 大家看这一时代恰好和我的童年互相重合
en:So, basically it all began withthis whole idea of a computer.Who has a computer? Yeah.O.K., so, everyone has a computer.Even a mobile phone, it&#39;s a computer.And — anyone remember this workbook,&quot;Instant Activities for Your Apple&quot; —free poster in each book?This was how computing began.Don&#39;t forget: a computer came out; it had no software.You&#39;d buy that thing, you&#39;d bring it home, you&#39;d plug it in,and it would do absolutely nothing at all.So, you had to program it,and there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this.I mean, this was great.It&#39;s, like, you know, Herbie the Apple II.It&#39;s such a great way to —I mean, they should make Java books like this,and we&#39;ve have no problem learning a program.But this was a great, grand time of the computer,when it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era.And, you see,this era coincided with my own childhood.

zh-cn:我在西雅图的一家豆腐厂里长大在座的有谁是在家庭作坊中长大的?吃了不少苦? 是的, 是的.逆境出人才 受点磨难不好么?磨难能改变你一生 我这一生 你知道的 我在豆腐厂长大那是一个家庭作坊我母亲从某种意义上来说也是设计师她做了这种 豆腐料理墙然后顾客们都很疑惑,因为他们都觉得这是一家餐馆品牌形象没弄对 是吧但是, 不管怎样, 我就在这儿长大这家西雅图的小豆腐作坊当时大概就这样:小房间 我在这儿长大 照片里显得我很大
en:I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.Who of you grew up in a family business,suffered the torture? Yes, yes.The torture was good. Wasn&#39;t it good torture?It was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu;it was a family business.And my mother was a kind of a designer, also.She&#39;d make this kind of, like, wall of tofu cooking,and it would confuse the customers,because they all thought it was a restaurant.A bad sort of branding thing, or whatever.But, anyway, that&#39;s where I grew up,in this little tofu factory in Seattle,and it was kind of like this:a small room where I kind of grew up. I&#39;m big there in that picture.

zh-cn:这是我爸爸. 我爸有点像MacGyver, 说真的他会发明些把东西变重的方法比如这后面 有一个水泥块他需要用这些水泥块来挤压豆腐因为豆腐其实是有点像液体的东西,所以你得用沉的东西把水分挤出来 把它弄结实豆腐出来时很大一块然后我爸就会用手把它们切开.这个不能说 家族机密了 大家都理解的我的父亲是世上最实在的人了一次下雨天他走进一家喜互惠超市滑倒 手骨折了 马上跑出来他不想给喜互惠添麻烦结果 我把的手就断了两个星期 整整两星期我和我哥哥就不得不在店里帮忙做所有事这可真是苦 真苦啊再来说 我爸把那么一大块豆腐切开像刀切一样 嚓 嚓 嚓 “哇哦~”而我第一次切的时候就像这样 “唔哦..”报废了 不过不管咋说豆腐就像我的根 基本上在店里工作实在太苦我就很喜欢上学 学校简直就是天堂在学校我表现也很好
en:That&#39;s my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really:he would invent, like, ways to make things heavy.Like back here, there&#39;s like, concrete block technology here,and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu,because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing,and so you have to have heavy stuffto push out the liquid and make it hard.Tofu comes out in these big batches,and my father would sort of cut them by hand.I can&#39;t tell you — family business story: you&#39;d understand this —my father was the most sincere man possible.He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day,slipped, broke his arm, rushed out:he didn&#39;t want to inconvenience Safeway.So, instead, you know, my father&#39;s, like, arm&#39;s brokenfor two weeks in the store, and that week —now, those two weeks were when my older brother and Ihad to do everything.And that was torture, real torture.Because, you see, we&#39;d seen my fathertaking the big block of tofu and cutting it,like, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow.So, the first time I did that, I went, like, whoa! Like this.Bad blocks. But anyways,the tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically.And because working in a store was so hard,I liked going to school; it was like heaven.And I was really good at school.

zh-cn:然后 我考上了麻省理工 大家知道的和在座大部分创意人士一样你们的父母都阻断过您的创意之路 是吧?所以 都一样的我美术很好 数学也好 我爸就说约翰的数学最好了那我去了麻省理工 学数学直到我遇到这个绝佳机会计算机开始变得视觉化苹果电脑正好问世了我去MIT时就拥有一台苹果电脑那当时对于一个可以横跨两个领域的人来说是很好的机遇
en:So, when I got to MIT, you know,as most of you who are creatives,your parents all told you not to be creative, right?So, same way, you know,I was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he&#39;s —John&#39;s good at math.I went to MIT, did my math,but I had this wonderful opportunity,because computers had just become visual.The Apple — Macintosh just came out;I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT.And it was a time when a guy who, kind of,could cross the two sides —it was a good time.

zh-cn:结果 我记得我第一个重要的软件是直接模仿当时的 Aldus PageMaker我做了一个在桌面出版系统由此我在第一次了解到嗯 融合这两方面挺有趣的而对于年轻人来说有个问题在做的各位学生记好了 —就是 你非常容易自我膨胀当我设计图标的时候 我就像是图标之王然后我就说 是啊 我真的很在行然后很幸运地我有幸去了某个地方——图书馆在图书馆里我遇到了这本书我找到了这本书 它叫做&quot;设计的思考&quot; 是一个叫做保罗·兰德的人写的它的出版量有点小; 不知你们见过没有很好的一本小书 关于这个人的 保罗·兰德当时最杰出的平面设计师之一书也写得及很不错当我看到此人作品时我才意识到我自己在设计上多么糟糕不管当时我怎么说的吧突然我就有了某种职业目标追求的欲望还很强烈
en:And so, I remember that my first major piece of softwarewas on a direct copy of then-Aldus PageMaker.I made a desktop publishing system way back when,and that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to —oh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix.And the problem when you&#39;re younger —for all you students out there —is, your head gets kind of big really easy.And when I was making icons, I was, like,the icon master,and I was, like, yeah, I&#39;m really good at this, you know.And then luckily, you know,I had the fortune of going to something called a library,and in the library I came upon this very book.I found this book. It&#39;s called,&quot;Thoughts on Design,&quot; by a man named Paul Rand.It&#39;s a little slim volume; I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve seen this.It&#39;s a very nice little book. It&#39;s about this guy, Paul Rand,who was one of the greatest graphic designers,and also a great writer as well.And when I saw this man&#39;s work,I realized how bad I was at design,or whatever I called it back then,and I suddenly had a kind of career goal,kind of in hot pursuit.

zh-cn:这是个比较重要的转变 我去了MIT 念完了拿到硕士学位 又去了艺术学校开始设计些东西比如筷子包装 餐巾 菜单 — 任何我可以得到的机会有点横冲直撞 呆头呆脑地在设计路上前进 随便了发表设计作品的时候你们有没有觉得奇怪过?还记得那个时刻吗 — 发表自己的设计?记得那一刻吗? 感觉特好, 是不是?是的 我的设计出版了哇哦 我的设计被发表在一本书中了耶之后 事情就有点怪怪的了我开始思考计算机这个东西因为计算机总是会让我犯糊涂我并不十分理解它 而Paul Rand是个有些暴躁的设计师懂么 暴躁的设计师 就像是一块.. 好的法国面包?他的一本书中写道:&quot;一名耶鲁的学生曾说&#39;我来到这儿是学设计的 不是学怎么使用计算机的&#39;设计学校当心了。&quot;当时是80年代支持和反对计算机的人讨论得正激烈那段时间其实很难熬对我来说这是Rand给我的重要信息
en:So I kind of switched. I went to MIT, finished.I got my masters,and then went to art school after that.And just began to design stuff,like chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus — whatever I could get a handle on:sort of wheel-and-deal, move up in the design world, whatever.And isn&#39;t it that strange moment when you publish your design?Remember that moment — publishing your designs?Remember that moment? It felt so good, didn&#39;t it?So, I was published, you know,so, wow, my design&#39;s in a book, you know?After that, things kind of got strange,and I got thinking about the computer,because the computer to me always, kind of, bothered me.I didn&#39;t quite get it. And Paul Randwas a kind of crusty designer,you know, a crusty designer, like a good — kind of like a good French bread?You know, he wrote in one of his books:&quot;A Yale student once said,&#39;I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.&#39;Design schools take heed.&quot;This is in the &#39;80s,in the great clash of computer/non-computer people.A very difficult time, actually.And this to me was an important message from Rand.

zh-cn:于是我开始捣鼓计算机这是我的第一次玩儿的东西, 我自己的严肃玩意儿我做了一个类似Adobe Illustrator的实用程序它看起来很像Illustrator 它可以 比如 画图做这个其实挺难的做这部分花了一个月时间然后我想, 要是加这样一个功能会怎样呢比如我可以说 这个点你可以像鸟一样飞 你自由了 那意思所以我可以 好像 改变稳定性利用一个控制盘上的小控件我就可以看它翻来翻去.当是是1993年我的教授们看到这个时 都生气极了他们说 为什么它要动?他们说 马上让它停下来我就说 嗯 这才是一切的重点：让它动。然后他说 那么 它什么时候停下来?我说 永远不然后他说 这更糟 现在就停下来我开始研究这整个概念这个叫计算机的东西是什么? 它是一个很奇怪的媒介它不像印刷 也不像视频它持续永久 一种很奇怪的媒介所以 我从这个开始并且开始开始寻找更多的东西
en:And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time.This is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play.I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator-ish thing.It looks like Illustrator; it can, like, draw.It was very hard to make this, actually.It took a month to make this part.And then I thought, what if I added this feature,where I can say, this point,you can fly like a bird. You&#39;re free, kind of thing.So I could, sort of, change the kind of stabilitywith a little control there on the dial,and I can sort of watch it flip around.And this is in 1993.And when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me.They were saying, Why&#39;s it moving?They were saying, Make it stop now.Now, I was saying, Well, that&#39;s the whole point: it&#39;s moving.And he says, Well, when&#39;s it going to stop?And I said, Never.And he said, Even worse. Stop it now.I started studying this whole idea,of like, what is this computer? It&#39;s a strange medium.It&#39;s not like print. It&#39;s not like video.It lasts forever. It&#39;s a very strange medium.So, I went off with this,and began to look for things even more.

zh-cn:所以 在日本 我开始做与人相关的试验其实这不太好: 人类试验我会做这样的事情, 让学生当笔:这是蓝笔, 红笔, 绿笔, 黑笔.然后一个人坐下来 画一副画他们在笑 因为他说从中间靠右画到中间 然后他搞错了看 人类不知道如何接收命令计算机却很在行这个人解决出了怎么让这个计算机用两支笔同时画:你知道 你, 笔, 做这个; 然后 你, 笔, 做这个.所以开始在纸上有了多支笔 —仍然, 用我们的手很难做.然后一个人发现这个&quot;啊哈时刻&quot;就是你可以利用坐标系统.我们想, 哈, 这样问题就迎刃而解了.到最后, 他画了一座房子. 这事最无聊了太计算机化了 我们开始像计算机一样思考 —X, Y系统 — 有点革命性
en:And so in Japan, I began to experiment with people.This is actually bad: human experiments.I would do these things where I&#39;d have students become pens:there&#39;s blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen.And someone sits down and draws a picture.They&#39;re laughing because he said,draw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.See, humans don&#39;t know how to take orders;the computer&#39;s so good at it.This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once:you know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this.And so began to have multiple pens on the page —again, hard to do with our hands.And then someone discovered this &quot;a-ha moment&quot;where you could use coordinate systems.We thought, ah, this is when it&#39;s going to happen.In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing.It became computerish; we began to think computerish —the X, Y system — and so that was kind of a revelation.

zh-cn:在这之后我又想用人建造一台计算机,叫做人力计算机.这是在1993年.请调低声音.这是一台计算机, 人就是计算机部件.在这面墙后面是一个存储器 一个CPU一个图形卡 一个存储系统他们正在搬起一张巨大的用纸板做的软盘它被放到计算机中那个小程序被输入到那张纸板盘中然后 她穿着盘从盘上的分段中读出数据然后计算机开始运行 启动起来这有点像一台工作着的计算机 我建造这个计算机时在某一个刻突然 — 怎么说? —顿悟了 我意识到计算机真是太快了这台计算机看起来挺快 - 她干得很卖力大家都跑来跑去 我们想 哇 它正在很快地运行这台计算机只被编程做一件事 就是当你移动鼠标的时候 屏幕上的鼠标就发生改变在计算机上 你挪动鼠标时 那小箭头跟着动在这台计算机上 如果你挪动鼠标 它会花半小时的时间来让鼠标箭头改变位置让你体会一下速度的量级计算机真是惊人的快 对吧?
en:And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people,called a human-powered computer.So, this happened in 1993.Sound down, please.It&#39;s a computer where the people are the parts.I have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU,a graphics card, a memory system.They&#39;re picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard.It&#39;s put inside the computer.And that little program&#39;s on that cardboard disk.So, she wears the disk,and reads the data off the sectors of the disk,and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really.And it&#39;s a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer,I had a moment of — what is it called? —the epiphany where I realized that the computer&#39;s just so fast.This computer appears to be fast - she&#39;s working pretty hard,and people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.And this computer&#39;s programmed to do only one thing, which is,if you move your mouse, the mouse changes on the screen.On the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around.On this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hourfor the mouse cursor to change.To give you a sense of the speed, the scale:the computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.?

zh-cn:在这之后我开始为不同公司做试验这是我在1996年为索尼做的这是三个索尼的H系列的设备响应声音如果你对着话筒讲话你会从耳机中听到一些音乐如果你对着电话讲话 会显示视频我开始以不同的方式与工业界进行试验用这种混合的技能我做了这广告 我不相信这种酒 但有时会喝还有香奈尔 是的 我开始做不同的项目
en:And so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies.This is something I did for Sony in 1996.It was three Sony &quot;H&quot; devicesthat responded to sound.So, if you talk into the mike,you&#39;ll hear some music in your headphones;if you talk in the phone, then video would happen.So, I began to experiment with industry in different wayswith this kind of mixture of skills.I did this ad. I don&#39;t believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes.And Chanel. So, getting to do different projects.

zh-cn:而且 我意识到一件事我喜欢创造我们都喜欢创造东西 做东西的过程很有趣.因此我从不尝试去招募员工我没有员工 所有东西都是我亲手所做 —这些有点受伤的手而影响这双手的是这个叫Inami Neomi的先生.这个人算是我的指导老师他是东京第一位数字媒体制作人可以说是他发现了我把我带入数字媒体领域他是个特别鼓舞人心的人我记得 我们在他的工作室里 大概早上2点然后他出现了 刚忙完某个客户会议他会进来说有我在这 一切都没问题.然后你就会感觉好很多我永远不会忘记.. 不会忘记...他惨遭横祸 — 会上了动脉瘤.后来就不省人事在他去世前的三年里 他就只能眨眼睛这一刻我突然意识到 哇啊我们的躯壳多么的脆弱我们外在的躯壳与思想多脆弱我就在想 我要怎么更多地利用它?你应该如何好好利用剩余的时间?Naomi让我想到了这一点
en:And also, one thing I realized is thatI like to make things.We like to make things. It&#39;s fun to make things.And so I never developed the ability to have a staff.I have no staff; it&#39;s all kind of made by hand —these sort of broken hands.And these hands were influencedby this man, Mr. Inami Naomi.This guy was my kind of like mentor.He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo.He&#39;s the guy that kind of discovered me,and kind of got me going in digital media.He was such an inspirational guy.I remember, like, we&#39;d be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m.,and then he&#39;d show up from some client meeting.He&#39;d come in and say, you know,If I am here, everything is okay.And you&#39;d feel so much better, you know.And I&#39;ll never forget how, like, but — I&#39;ll never forget how, like,he had a sudden situation with his — he had an aneurysm.He went into a coma.And so, for three years he was out, and he could only blink,and so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow —how fragile is this thing we&#39;re wearing,this body and mind we&#39;re wearing,and so I thought, How do you go for it more?How do you take that time you have left and go after it?So, Naomi was pivotal in that.
时间：10:41
zh-cn:后来 我开始更认真地思考计算机这时候我就在想好, 你有一个计算机程序,它响应动作 — X 和 Y —我意识到每一个计算机程序在程序内部都有这些图像如果你能看见这里在这角落你正在看的程序如果你把它展开 所有东西同一时间呈现真正同时发生的 和我们以前接触的东西都不一样我们习惯于在一个维度上工作而这全部同一时间发生计算机处于多元维度中而且 在那时我还很失望因为我要到各地的这些艺术和设计学校中去那儿有那些 &quot;计算机实验室&quot;这大概是90年代后期的事这是在巴塞尔一家很好的平面设计学校这个 脏脏的 有点破旧的阴暗的计算机房里我开始琢磨 这就是目标吗?这就是我们要的吗?
en:And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer.This was a moment where I was thinking about,so, you have a computer program,it responds to motion — X and Y —and I realized that each computer programhas all these images inside the program.So, if you can see here, you know,that program you&#39;re seeing in the corner,if you spread it out, it&#39;s all these things all at once.It&#39;s real simultaneity. It&#39;s nothing we&#39;re used to working with.We&#39;re so used to working in one vector.This is all at the same time.The computer lives in so many dimensions.And also, at the same time I was frustrated,because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere,and there were these, like, &quot;the computer lab,&quot; you know,and this is, like, in the late 1990s,and this is in Basel,a great graphic design school.And here&#39;s this, like, dirty, kind of, shoddy,kind of, dark computer room.And I began to wonder, Is this the goal?Is this what we want, you know?

zh-cn:同时 我开始对机器着迷 —比如说，复印机 — 这是在巴塞尔我注意到我们花了很多时间才令其交互可用 —这个 触摸屏 —我发现怎么只能触摸五个地方&quot;为什么我们浪费了那么多交互的可能呢?&quot;这是一个问题 还有 声音我发现我可以把我的ThinkPad当电话来用明白吗? 没有? 好吧另外, 我在Logan机场发现,这个好像冲我叫喊你听到了么? 像奶牛似的. 这是早上4点在Logan
en:And also, I began to be fascinated by machines —you know, like copy machines — and so this is actually in Basel.I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive —this is, like, a touch screen —and I noticed how you can only touch five places,and so, &quot;why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere?&quot;became a question. And also, the sound:I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it&#39;s a telephone.You get it? No? O.K.And also, I discovered in Logan airport,this was, like, calling out to me.Do you hear that? It&#39;s like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan.

en:So, I was wondering, like,what is this thing in front of me, this computer thing?It didn&#39;t make any sense.So, I began to make things again. This is another series of objectsmade of old computers from my basement.I made — I took my old Macintoshesand made different objects out of them from Tokyo.I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves,so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots.I made this series of works.They&#39;re paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middleas a kind of display that&#39;s sort of thinking,I&#39;m abstract art. What am I? I&#39;m abstract.And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction.

en:I began to be fascinated by plastic,so I spent four months making eight plastic blocksperfectly optically transparent,as a kind of release of stress.Because of that, I became interested in blue tape,so in San Francisco, at C.C., I had a whole exhibition on blue tape.I made a whole installation out of blue tape — blue painters&#39; tape.And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me,so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think,Well, what else is there in life?And so computers, as you know,these big computers, there are now tiny computers.They&#39;re littler computers, so the one-chip computers,I began to program one-chip computersand make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs.I began to make LED sculpturesthat would live inside little boxes out of MDF.This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy.Very simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs.This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp:it&#39;s sort of a plastic rice lamp;it&#39;s very friendly.I did a show in London last year made out of iPods —I used iPods as a material.So I took 16 iPod Nanosand made a kind of a Nano fish, basically.Recently, this is for Reebok.I&#39;ve done shoes for Reebok as well,as a kind of a hobby for apparel.

en:So anyways, there are all these things you can do,but the thing I love the most is toexperience, taste the world.The world is just so tasty.We think we&#39;ll go to a museum; that&#39;s where all the tastes are.No, they&#39;re all out there.So, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really,actually, around the Louvre area.This I found, where nature had made a picture for me.This is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature.In this strange moment where, like, these things kind of appeared.We all are creative people.We have this gene defect in our mind.We can&#39;t help but stop, right? This feeling&#39;s a wonderful thing.It&#39;s the forever-always-on museum.This is from the Cape last year.I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design,which we know as circle-triangle-square.It&#39;s everywhere on the beach, I discovered.I began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square.I put these all back, by the way.And I also discovered how .some rocks are twins separated at birth.This is also out there, you know.I&#39;m, like, how did this happen, kind of thing?I brought you guys together again.

I have to do this.And I went after it with passion.However, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose —going to RISD — and I couldn&#39;t reconcile this real easy,because the letters had told me, MIT forever.But I discovered in the French word raison d&#39;être.I was, like, aha, wait a second.And there RISD appeared.And so I realized it was O.K. to go.

en:There&#39;s my perspective. Because in reality,the problem isn&#39;t how to make the world more technological.It&#39;s about how to make it more humane again.And if anything, I think RISD has a strange DNA.It&#39;s a strange exuberanceabout materials, about the world:a fascination that I think the world needsquite very much right now.So, thank you everyone.
