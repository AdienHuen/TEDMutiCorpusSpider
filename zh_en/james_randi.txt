zh-cn:上午好。能见到这么多名流在座真开心。看来大家心情也不错。面对真实的世界，我的背景，态度和方法都别具一格，因为我是魔术师。我可不是什么变戏法的，若是变戏法的，就得采用咒语符文，古里古怪的手势，那样才能变出戏法。我可不来那一套；我是魔术师，假扮成货真价实的术士。
en:Good morning.Happy to see so many fine folks out hereand so many smiling faces.I have a very peculiarbackground, attitude and approachto the real worldbecause I am a conjurer.Now, I prefer that term over magician,because if I were a magician, that would meanthat I use spells and incantationsand weird gesturesin order to accomplish real magic.No, I don&#39;t do that; I&#39;m a conjurer,who is someone who pretends to bea real magician. (Laughter)

zh-cn:那么，那种把戏是怎么弄的呢？有个前提是像你们一样的观众都会对所闻所见进行假设。举个例子，我走上台来，我从讲台上取下麦克风把它拧开，你们就认定这是个麦克风了，其实错了。（笑声）事实上，这件东西是你们当中至少一半人所不熟悉的。这是把剃须刀，看到了吧。当麦克风用它一点儿都不好使。我试用多次了。你们的另一个假定是—这只是告诉大家你们都会假设—可能并且即将进行种种假设—当你们受到一定的暗示。你们相信我正在看着你们。错。我没在看你们。我看不到你们。我知道你们就座在大厅里 ，上台之前他们已经说了，观众座无虚席。我知道你们在座是因为我听见你们了，但我看不到，原因是我通常戴眼镜才看得见。我现在戴的只是没镜片的空镜框，的确是空镜框。
en:Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?We depend on the factthat audiences, such as yourselves,will make assumptions.For example, when I walked up hereand I took the microphone from the standand switched it on,you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.(Laughter)As a matter of fact, this is somethingthat about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.It&#39;s a beard trimmer, you see?And it makes a very bad microphone;I&#39;ve tried it many times. (Laughter)The other assumption that you made —and this little lesson is to show youthat you will make assumptions.Not only that you can, but that you willwhen they are properly suggested to you.You believe I&#39;m looking at you.Wrong. I&#39;m not looking at you. I can&#39;t see you.I know you&#39;re out there, they told me backstage, it&#39;s a full house and such.I know you&#39;re there because I can hear you,but I can&#39;t see you because I normally wear glasses.These are not glasses, these are empty frames. (Laughter)Quite empty frames.

zh-cn:为什么一个上了年纪的人戴着个空镜框出现在你们眼前？是来骗你们的，先生们女士们勾引你们上当，让大家明白你们也会做出假设，这一点千万别忘记。现在，我得先把眼镜戴上，这样才能看见你们，或许能方便我看清楚，也不一定。我还没好好看一看呢。哦，马马虎虎，跟不戴差不多。
en:Now why would a grown man appear before youwearing empty frames on his face?To fool you, ladies and gentlemen,to deceive you, to show that you, too,can make assumptions.Don&#39;t you ever forget that.Now, I have to do something — first of all, switch to real glassesso I can actually see you,which would probably be a convenience. I don&#39;t know.I haven&#39;t had a good look. Well, it&#39;s not that great a convenience.

zh-cn:现在我得做的事情，对魔术师来说，看着有点儿怪异。我要吃些药。这儿是满满一瓶的安睡药片。待会儿我再解释。不看服用说明。说明书都是按政府要求写的，肯定是让你看着糊涂的。我吃足够量的药片。其实是一整瓶的量。32片安睡药。
en:I have to do something now, which seemsa little bit strange for a magician.But I&#39;m going to take some medication.This is a full bottle ofCalms Forte.I&#39;ll explain that in just a moment.Ignore the instructions,that&#39;s what the government has to put in thereto confuse you, I&#39;m sure.I will take enough of these. Mm.Indeed, the whole container.Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.
时间： 2:46
zh-cn:既然已经服下去了—我过一会跟大家解释—我必须告诉你们，我是个演员。我扮演某一特定的角色。我演个术士，男巫，或者干脆叫神汉。要是有谁到台上来出现在我跟前，他又号称是哈姆雷特，一位古代丹麦的王子，你们肯定觉着被侮辱了，的确如此。怎么会有谁可以假定你们就相信这类稀奇古怪的事情呢？还真大有人在，他们明目张胆地告诉众生他们具备灵异的、魔幻的力量，他们能预知未来，他们能与亡人接触。啊，他们还说，可以把占星术以及其它占卜用的方法卖给你们。哦，他们可真是巴不得卖给你们呢。他们还说能给你永动机和什么不耗能的玩意儿。他们自称灵媒师，或者有特异功能什么的。
en:Now that I&#39;ve done that — I&#39;ll explain it in a moment —I must tell you thatI am an actor.I&#39;m an actor who plays a specific part.I play the part of a magician,a wizard, if you will, a real wizard.If someone were to appear on this stage in front of meand actually claim to bean ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet,you would be insultedand rightly so.Why would a man assume that you would believesomething bizarre like this?But there exists out therea very large populationof people who will tell youthat they have psychic, magical powersthat they can predict the future,that they can make contact with the deceased.Oh, they also saythey will sell you astrologyor other fortunetelling methods.Oh, they gladly sell you that, yes.And they also saythat they can give you perpetual motion machinesand free energy systems.They claim to be psychics,or sensitives, whatever they can.

zh-cn:但是有一点让他们现了原形，就在近期发生的，竟有这样的事儿，跟死人说话。恕我孤陋寡闻了，我以为死亡即不能与人交流。你们也这么想吧。可这帮人，他们要跟你们说的是，他们不但能跟死人交流—你好哇—还能听见死人说的话呢，再把他们听到的讯息回传给生者。我怀疑其真实性。我不以为然是因为处于非主流文化中的这帮人用的手法跟我们魔术师一模照样，完全一样，同样的物质方法，同样的心理手段。迄今他们有效地、深刻地欺骗了全球上百万众生令人深受其害。他们向老百姓行骗。骗取大量钱财。令众生陷入感情的痛苦之中。上亿美元都被骗走年年如此，随处可见，这类自吹自擂的骗子。
en:But the one thing that has made a big comebackjust recentlyis this business ofspeaking with the dead.Now, to my innocent mind,dead impliesincapable of communicating. (Laughter)You might agree with me on that.But these people, they tend to tell you thatnot only can they communicate with the dead —&quot;Hi, there&quot; —but they can hear the dead as well,and they can relay this information back to the living.I wonder if that&#39;s true.I don&#39;t think so, becausethis subculture of peopleuse exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do,exactly the same —the same physical methods, the same psychological methods —and they effectively and profoundlydeceive millions of people around the earth,to their detriment.They deceive these people,costs them a lot of money,cost them a lot of emotional anguish.Billions of dollars are spentevery year, all over the globe,on these charlatans.

zh-cn:我有两个问题我要向这类人发问如果我有这个机会。第一个问题：如果我要他们召唤谁—-因为他们用耳朵听到那些讯息。他们像这样听灵魂说些什么。我要你召唤我奶奶的灵魂，她去世的时候有一份家庭遗嘱，她给藏在什么地方了，我们都不知道。所以我们得问问奶奶，“遗嘱放在哪儿，奶奶？”奶奶怎么说的？她说，“我在天堂，这儿真美。我在这儿跟所有的老朋友一起，那些故去的朋友，以及我的家人，还有我小时候养过的宠物阿猫阿狗。我爱你们，永远和你们在一起。再见。她死活就没回答问题。遗嘱放在哪儿？其实她本来就该直接说，“哦，放在百科全书后面了，在阅览室的第二层架子上。”但她就不说。她没说。她不把有用的信息带给我们。我们可是为获得信息付了大价钱的，钱花了，信儿没问到。
en:Now, I have two questionsI would like to ask these peopleif I had the opportunity to do so.First question: If I want to ask them to call up —because they do hear them through the ear.They listen to the spirits like this —I&#39;m going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmotherbecause, when she died, she had the family will,and she secreted it someplace. We don&#39;t know where it is,so we ask Granny, &quot;Where is the will, Granny?&quot;What does Granny say? She says, &quot;I&#39;m in heaven and it&#39;s wonderful.I&#39;m here with all my old friends, my deceased friends,and my familyand all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.And I love you, and I&#39;ll always be with you.Good bye.&quot;And she didn&#39;t answer the damn question!Where is the will?Now, she could easily have said,&quot;Oh, it&#39;s in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia,&quot;but she doesn&#39;t say that. No, she doesn&#39;t.She doesn&#39;t bring any useful information to us.We paid a lot of money for that information,be we didn&#39;t get it.
时间： 5:50
zh-cn:我要问的第二个问题，相当简单。比方说，假设我请他们跟我已经故去的岳父的灵魂取得联系。为什么他们坚持说—-记住，他们对着他的耳朵说—-为什么要说，“我的名字是J打头还是M？”这玩的是猎杀游戏吗？打猎还是钓鱼？什么把戏？不就一个问题么？难道问了20个问题？不，更像是120个问题。太不幸，太邪恶了，彻底丧失良心了—-我没事儿，你们别担心—-这伙人搞什么鬼把戏。他们在沾别人的便宜，利用那些天真、无知、悲伤和贫穷的人们。
en:The second question that I&#39;d like to ask, rather simple:Suppose I ask them to contactthe spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.Why do they insist on saying —remember, they speak into this ear —why do they say, &quot;My name starts with J or M?&quot;Is this a hunting game?Hunting and fishing? What is it?Is it 20 questions? No, it&#39;s more like 120 questions.But it is a cruel, vicious,absolutely conscienceless —I&#39;ll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) —game that these people play.And they take advantage of the innocent, the naive,the grieving, the needy people out there.

zh-cn:其中有个过程，所谓冷读术。有个知名知姓的男巫，他叫凡•普拉，全名是詹姆斯•凡•普拉。干这行的里面他算大佬。还有约翰•爱德华，斯尔维亚•布朗，罗斯玛丽•艾尔提，他们都是这行当里面数得着的。全球有几百个专干这行的巫师巫婆，但在这个国家，詹姆斯•凡•普拉就是老大了。知道他管用的伎俩吗？他通常会忽悠你已经故去的人是怎么走的，他用耳朵与逝者交谈。他惯用的专业术语是，在他生前，他告诉我，他告诉我，他呼吸困难。”在座的各位，那不就是人死亡的过程么。（笑声）停止呼吸，然后宣告死亡。多显而易见的事儿。那就是逝者要带回给人们的信息吗？我想不是。马上，这帮专业人士要进行猜测了，他们会说，“为什么我得到一个“电”字？他在跟我说“电”。“他是个电工？”不是。“他曾用过一个电动剃须刀？”没有。少来这种搜索问题的把戏。他们无非就指着这套骗钱。
en:Now, this is a processthat is called cold reading.There&#39;s one fellow out there,Van Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.He&#39;s one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.John Edward, Sylvia Browneand Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.There are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country,James Van Praagh is very big.And what does he do? He likes to tell youhow the deceased got deceased,the people he&#39;s talking to through his ear, you see?So what he says is, very often, is like this: he says,&quot;He tells me, he tells me, before he passed,that he had trouble breathing.&quot;Folks, that&#39;s what dying is all about!(Laughter)You stop breathing, and then you&#39;re dead.It&#39;s that simple.And that&#39;s the kind of information they&#39;re going to bring back to you?I don&#39;t think so.Now, these people will make guesses, they&#39;ll say things like,&quot;Why am I getting electricity?He&#39;s saying to me, &#39;Electricity.&#39;Was he an electrician?&quot; &quot;No.&quot;&quot;Did he ever have an electric razor?&quot; &quot;No.&quot;It was a game of hunting questions like this.This is what they go through.

en:Now, folks often ask usat the James Randi Educational Foundation,they call me, they say, &quot;Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?Isn&#39;t it just a lot of fun?&quot;No, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.Now, it may bring a certain amount of comfort,but that comfort lastsonly about 20 minutes or so.And then the people look in the mirror, and they say,I just paid a lot of money for that reading.And what did she say to me? &#39;I love you!&#39;&quot;They always say that.They don&#39;t get any information,they don&#39;t get any value for what they spend.

zh-cn:斯尔维亚•布朗就是目前的头号骗子。我们都叫她“大魔爪”。斯尔维亚•布朗—谢谢你—现在这行当中，斯尔维亚•布朗就算老大了。斯尔维亚•布朗—你听好了—我要揭穿你如何打一通20分钟的电话，就骗取了700美元。她甚至都不必走一趟。而你得等上两年的时间才约得到她，因为她提前预定的时间就是两年。可以用信用卡或别的方式付款，接下来两年之内的某个时间，她会给你打电话。一听就知道是她本人。“你好，我是斯尔维亚•布朗。”错不了。一听就是她。蒙特尔·威廉姆斯智能过人。这位美国著名电视节目主持人家喻户晓。他修养高，又聪明。他晓得斯尔维亚•布朗的勾当。但他不去理会。事不关己，高高挂起。因为只要赞助商们喜欢，他就会随时向电视观众推介她。
en:Now, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.We call her &quot;The Talons.&quot;Sylvia Browne — thank you —Sylvia Browne is the big operatorin this field at this very moment.Now, Sylvia Browne — just to show you —she actually gets 700 dollarsfor a 20 minute reading over the telephone,she doesn&#39;t even go there in person,and you have to wait up to two years becauseshe&#39;s booked ahead that amount of time.You pay by credit card or whatever,and then she will call yousometime in the next two years.You can tell it&#39;s her. &quot;Hello, this is Sylvia Browne.&quot;That&#39;s her, you can tell right away.Now, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.We all know who he is on television.He&#39;s well educated, he&#39;s smart,he knows what Sylvia Browne is doingbut he doesn&#39;t give a damn.He just doesn&#39;t care.Because, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it,and he will expose herto television publicity all the time.

zh-cn:而问题是斯尔维亚•布朗凭什么收了你700美元呢。首先，她会说出你的守护天使是谁。没有那可怎么行呢？她告诉你的前世叫什么名字，上辈子你是谁。切—结果那些听她瞎掰扯的女人，都成了古巴比伦的公主，或者有类似的显赫身世。男的都曾经是跟随阿伽门农打仗的希腊斗士。却从没有人提及伦敦大街上擦皮鞋的孩童，14岁就死于肺病。显然，卑微的小生命死不足惜。可能你们也注意到了，有件事很奇怪—-在电视上露面的这些家伙—-从来不召回地狱的死人。他们找的都是天堂里的，从来不去敲地狱的门。若是把我故去的某个朋友叫回来，他们也不会去叫......反正大家都明白。
en:Now, what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars?She gives you the names of your guardian angels, that&#39;s first.Now, without that, how could we possibly function? (Laughter)She gives you the names of previous lives,who you were in previous lives.Duh.It turns out that the womenthat she gives readings forwere all Babylonian princesses, or something like that.And the men were all Grecian warriorsfighting with Agamemnon.Nothing is ever said abouta 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of Londonwho died of consumption.He isn&#39;t worth bringing back, obviously.And the strange thing — folks, you may have noticed this too.You see these folks on television —they never call anybody back from hell.

zh-cn:开始我吞下了一些药片，我得解释一下。同种疗法，我们看看这是什么疗法。嗯，你们多少有所了解。对，是另一种形式的疗法。事实上同种疗法包括—-仅此而已。这是解压舒眠锭。我忘了告诉大家—-这是32片安眠药。我刚消化了合六天半剂量的安眠药。（笑声）六天半，当然是致命的剂量。这背面的说明书写着。&quot;万一吞服过量，立即联系您附近的毒药控制中心。&quot;后面写着个800的号码。都别担心。我没事儿。我不需要急救，因为我在过去八至十年间，一直向全世界的观众表演这项绝技，服用过量的同种疗法安眠药。
en:Now, I popped some pills earlier.I have to explain that to you.Homeopathy, let&#39;s find out what that&#39;s all about.Hmm. You&#39;ve heard of it.It&#39;s an alternative form of healing, right?Homeopathy actually consists — and that&#39;s what this is.This is Calms Forte,32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.I just ingestedsix and a half days worth of sleeping pills.(Laughter)Six and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.It says right on the back here,&quot;In case of overdose,contact your poison control center immediately,&quot;and it gives an 800 number.Keep your seats — it&#39;s going to be okay.I don&#39;t really need itbecause I&#39;ve been doing this stuntfor audiences all over the worldfor the last eight or 10 years,taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills.
时间：12:24
zh-cn:这些药对我怎麽不管用呀？（笑声）（掌声）答案你可能想不到。什么是同种疗法？其实是服用真正有效的药物，进行稀释，刚好在阿伏伽德罗界限之内。稀释到一定程度，淡化为乌有。朋友们，我可不是在打比方，实际情况如此。这正相当于将325毫克阿司匹林药片投入塔霍湖里，然后搅动一番，当然是用很大一根木棒，等过了大约两年的时间，直到溶解得均匀了。之后，一旦你犯了头疼病，喝一口这湖里的水，哇塞！不疼了。（笑声）事实上，同种疗法不过如此。
en:Why don&#39;t they affect me?(Laughter)(Applause)The answer may surprise you.What is homeopathy?It&#39;s taking a medicine that really worksand diluting it downwell beyond Avogadro&#39;s limit.Diluting it down to the pointwhere there&#39;s none of it left. (Laughter)Now folks, this is notjust a metaphor I&#39;m going to give you now, it&#39;s true.It&#39;s exactly equivalent to takingone 325 milligram aspirin tablet,throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe,and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick,and waiting two years or sountil the solution is homogeneous.Then, when you get a headache,you take a sip of this water, and — voila! — it is gone.(Laughter)Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about.

zh-cn:他们还说—-你们一定觉得好玩—-药物越稀释，疗效越强。但是，我们听说佛罗里达的一个人，可怜的家伙，服用了同种疗法的药。他死于服药过量。他忘了吃他的药。（笑声）这是怎么说的。荒唐，绝对荒唐。真不知道我们在干什么。多年来相信这些胡说八道。
en:And another claim that they make — you&#39;ll love this one —the more dilute the medicine is, they say,the more powerful it is.Now wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.The poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.He died of an overdose.He forgot to take his pill.(Laughter)Work on it.

Clarke said,The rotting of the human mind,the business of believing in the paranormal and the occultand the supernatural —all of this total nonsense,this medieval thinking —I think something should be done about that,and it all lies in education.Largely, it&#39;s the mediawho are to blame for this sort of thing.They shamelessly promoteall kinds of nonsense of this sortbecause it pleases the sponsors.It&#39;s the bottom line, the dollar line.That&#39;s what they&#39;re looking at.
