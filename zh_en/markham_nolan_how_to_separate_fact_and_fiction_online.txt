zh-cn:我十七岁开始从事记者工作这在当时可是一个有趣的工作，因为正如你们所知，媒体行业经历着巨变，你们大多数是从商业层面来看这些事情，如这个产业媒体的经济状况十分糟糕，就像我祖父的说的，利润都被谷歌独吞了。
en:I&#39;ve been a journalist now since I was about 17,and it&#39;s an interesting industry to be in at the moment,because as you all know, there&#39;s a huge amount of upheavalgoing on in media, and most of you probably know thisfrom the business angle, which is that the business modelis pretty screwed, and as my grandfather would say,the profits have all been gobbled up by Google.

zh-cn:所以在这个时代做记者是个有趣的差事，不过我所关心的巨变不是输出端方面的。而是输入端。我关注的是我们如何获取信息和收集新闻。事情已经发生了变化，因为权力由新闻机构交到了听众的手上。长期以来观众没有任何手段影响新闻行业或带来改变。他们无法与媒体建立联系。如今改变已经不可逆转。
en:So it&#39;s a really interesting time to be a journalist,but the upheaval that I&#39;m interested in is not on the output side.It&#39;s on the input side. It&#39;s concern withhow we get information and how we gather the news.And that&#39;s changed, because we&#39;ve had a huge shiftin the balance of power fromthe news organizations to the audience.And the audience for such a long time was in a positionwhere they didn&#39;t have any way of affecting newsor making any change. They couldn&#39;t really connect.And that&#39;s changed irrevocably.

zh-cn:我最早接触新闻媒体是在1984年，那时候BBC员工罢工一天。我很不开心。我非常愤怒。我看不到动画片了。所以我写了一封信。在愤怒的信中用“爱你的四岁观众Markham”来结尾相当有效。如今也仍然有效。我不知道我是否影响了那个为期一天的罢工，不过我知道的是他们三周之后才给我回复。一去一来，一个人想要引起媒体的注意并得到反馈需要这么长时间。现在的情况与从前截然不同，因为如今的记者和观众实时互动。我们不能等着观众对新闻作出反应。现在是我们对观众的行为作出反应，并且我们依赖于此。他们正帮助我们找到新闻。他们正帮助我们找到解读新闻的最好角度，以及什么才是他们最想听的。这种互动是实时的。速度快很多 这将一直。发展下去，而记者只是充当一个追逐者的角色。
en:My first connection with the news media wasin 1984, the BBC had a one-day strike.I wasn&#39;t happy. I was angry. I couldn&#39;t see my cartoons.So I wrote a letter.And it&#39;s a very effective way of ending your hate mail:&quot;Love Markham, Aged 4.&quot; Still works.I&#39;m not sure if I had any impact on the one-day strike,but what I do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me.And that was the round journey. It took that long for anyoneto have any impact and get some feedback.And that&#39;s changed now because, as journalists,we interact in real time. We&#39;re not in a positionwhere the audience is reacting to news.We&#39;re reacting to the audience, and we&#39;re actually relying on them.They&#39;re helping us find the news. They&#39;re helping usfigure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear.So it&#39;s a real-time thing. It&#39;s much quicker. It&#39;s happeningon a constant basis, and the journalist is always playing catch up.

zh-cn:请允许我举一个记者依赖观众获取新闻的例子，9月5日哥斯达黎加发生了地震。7.6级，相当大的地震。地震波用了60秒的时间传到250公里之外的马那瓜（尼加拉瓜共和国首都）。所以，马那瓜的地面在震中发生地震60秒之后开始颤抖。三十秒后，推特上出现了第一条有关地震的消息，有人发了“temblor”这样一条信息，意思就是地震。地震波的物理传播花了60秒。30秒之后地震的消息就可以即时传遍全球。理论上世界上所有人都有可能知道马那瓜正在发生地震。这些都是因为这个人有纪实报道的直觉，公布现有的最新状态，这就是我们现在都在做的一件事， 于是，凡是有什么事情发生，我们就更新自己的状态，或者发布一张照片，一段视频，这些信息源源不断的被上传到云存储。
en:To give an example of how we rely on the audience,on the 5th of September in Costa Rica, an earthquake hit.It was a 7.6 magnitude. It was fairly big.And 60 seconds is the amount of time it tookfor it to travel 250 kilometers to Managua.So the ground shook in Managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter.Thirty seconds later, the first message went onto Twitter,and this was someone saying &quot;temblor,&quot; which means earthquake.So 60 seconds was how long it tookfor the physical earthquake to travel.Thirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveledall around the world, instantly. Everyone in the world,hypothetically, had the potential to know that an earthquakewas happening in Managua.And that happened because this one person hada documentary instinct, which was to post a status update,which is what we all do now, so if something happens,we put our status update, or we post a photo,we post a video, and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream.

zh-cn:这就意味着持续的，海量的数据出现。数据流量实际上非常惊人。如果你用数字来计算的话，每分钟有72小时以上的新视频被上传到YouTube。也就是说，每分钟YouTube上都会出现一小时以上的新视频。照片方面，每秒钟有58张新照片被上传到Instagram，每秒钟Facebook上则会出现三千五百张以上的新照片。也就是说，我今天的演讲结束之后，YouTube上就多出了864小时的新视频，Facebook和Instagram上则多出了二百五十万张新照片。
en:And what that means is just constant,huge volumes of data going up.It&#39;s actually staggering. When you look at the numbers,every minute there are 72 more hoursof video on YouTube.So that&#39;s, every second, more than an hour of video gets uploaded.And in photos, Instagram, 58 photos are uploaded to Instagram a second.More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook.So by the time I&#39;m finished talking here, there&#39;ll be 864more hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started,and two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started.

zh-cn:因此，现在做记者真的非常有趣因为理论上，我们的信息源头无处不在。我可以即时免费了解任何时间发生在世界上任何地方的任何事情。这一点在座的每一位也都可以做到。
en:So it&#39;s an interesting position to be in as a journalist,because we should have access to everything.Any event that happens anywhere in the world, I should be able to know about itpretty much instantaneously, as it happens, for free.And that goes for every single person in this room.

zh-cn:唯一的问题是，面对大量信息时，如何找到有价值的内容筛选大量信息其实相当困难。飓风桑迪袭击美国期间，这一现象尤为明显。飓风桑迪是一次难得一见的超级风暴它袭击了浩淼宇宙中的iPhone之都（笑声）因此出现了大量我们以前从未见过的媒体素材。因此，记者必须分辨真伪，我们要辨别重新发布的老照片用以前风暴的照片合成的图片。来自电影《后天》的图片。（笑声）以及那些看起来非常真实、难以辨别真伪的图片。（笑声）
en:The only problem is, when you have that much information,you have to find the good stuff, and that can beincredibly difficult when you&#39;re dealing with those volumes.And nowhere was this brought home more than duringHurricane Sandy. So what you had in Hurricane Sandy wasa superstorm, the likes of which we hadn&#39;t seen for a long time,hitting the iPhone capital of the universe — (Laughter) —and you got volumes of media like we&#39;d never seen before.And that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes,so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted.We had to deal with composite imagesthat were merging photos from previous storms.We had to deal with images from films like &quot;The Day After Tomorrow.&quot; (Laughter)And we had to deal with images that were so realisticit was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all.(Laughter)
时间： 4:29
zh-cn:玩笑之外，有一些照片，比如Instagram上的这张，经历了记者们反复的调查和核实。他们不能确定这张照片的真伪。它在Instagram上遭到了过滤。有人认为光线有问题。几乎个个方面都遭到了质疑。最终，这张图片被证明是真实的。它来自曼哈顿市中心被水淹的C大街（Avenue C）。记者判断照片真实的理由是他们找到了照片的来源这张照片的拍摄者是纽约的美食博客写手。他们都备受尊敬、有一定知名度的作者。所以这张照片不是冒牌货，记者们可以证明它的真实性。这就是记者的工作，在大量的信息中进行甄选工作。记者不是寻找信息然后将它们传达给大众记者所作的是截住那些有可能造成伤害的不良信息。
en:But joking aside, there were images like this one from Instagramwhich was subjected to a grilling by journalists.They weren&#39;t really sure. It was filtered in Instagram.The lighting was questioned. Everything was questioned about it.And it turned out to be true. It was from Avenue Cin downtown Manhattan, which was flooded.And the reason that they could tell that it was realwas because they could get to the source, and in this case,these guys were New York food bloggers.They were well respected. They were known.So this one wasn&#39;t a debunk, it was actually something that they could prove.And that was the job of the journalist. It was filtering all this stuff.And you were, instead of going and finding the informationand bringing it back to the reader, you were holding backthe stuff that was potentially damaging.

zh-cn:找到信息的来源――找到可靠的信息来源变得越来越重要――现在大部分记者都从推特入手。推特就是一个实时的新闻网络，如果你知道如何利用它，就可以从上面获得大量的信息。
en:And finding the source becomes more and more important —finding the good source — and Twitter is where most journalists now go.It&#39;s like the de facto real-time newswire,if you know how to use it, because there is so much on Twitter.

zh-cn:2011年的埃及革命就是一个很好的例子不过它同时证明了从推特获取信息的优势和困难。对于一个在都柏林关注局势发展的、不会说阿拉伯语的人来说，推特上有很多好的信息来源找到可靠的信息来源是非常重要的。我们如何从茫茫的信息海洋中甄选出这样一个名单呢？这相当有难度，但只要找对方法就可以实现。意大利学者 André Pannison创造了这个效果图。他集中了侯塞尼・穆巴拉克辞职的那一天来自解放广场的推特消息这些点都是转发如果有人转发了某一条消息，两个点就会建立联系，一条信息被转发的次数越多就会有越来越多的点出现，越来越多的联系建立。这是一种将推特互动视觉化的出色方式，可以从中看出哪些人发布的信息更意思哪些人值得调查。随着互动的规模越来越大状态越来越活跃你就会找到这些互动中重要的、有规律的线索。你可以找到这个点然后决定，“好，我要去调查一下这些人。这些的消息看起来似乎相对可靠。让我们来看看他们都是何方神圣。”
en:And a good example of how useful it can bebut also how difficult was the Egyptian revolution in 2011.As a non-Arabic speaker, as someone who was lookingfrom the outside, from Dublin,Twitter lists, and lists of good sources,people we could establish were credible, were really important.And how do you build a list like that from scratch?Well, it can be quite difficult, but you have to know what to look for.This visualization was done by an Italian academic.He&#39;s called André Pannison, and he basicallytook the Twitter conversation in Tahrir Squareon the day that Hosni Mubarak would eventually resign,and the dots you can see are retweets, so when someoneretweets a message, a connection is made between two dots,and the more times that message is retweeted by other people,the more you get to see these nodes, these connections being made.And it&#39;s an amazing way of visualizing the conversation,but what you get is hints at who is more interestingand who is worth investigating.And as the conversation grew and grew, it becamemore and more lively, and eventually you were leftwith this huge, big, rhythmic pointer of this conversation.You could find the nodes, though, and then you went,and you go, &quot;Right, I&#39;ve got to investigate these people.These are the ones that are obviously making sense.Let&#39;s see who they are.&quot;

zh-cn:现在在信息的洪流中实时网络对于记者来说愈发有趣，因为现在我们拥有比以往任何时候都更加丰富的工具来做此类调查。调查信息来源的工作也可以比以往深入许多。

zh-cn:有时候你会遇到非常吸引人的素材你非常想采用它，但因为不确定来源是否可靠有所顾忌。你不知道该素材是不是假的，不知道它是不是以前的内容被重新上传。你必须进行调查。我即将为你们播放的这个视频是几周之前发现的。
en:Sometimes you come across a piece of content thatis so compelling, you want to use it, you&#39;re dying to use it,but you&#39;re not 100 percent sure if you can becauseyou don&#39;t know if the source is credible.You don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a scrape. You don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a re-upload.And you have to do that investigative work.And this video, which I&#39;m going to let run through,was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago.

en:Markham Nolan: Okay, so now if you&#39;re a news producer, this is somethingyou&#39;d love to run with, because obviously, this is gold.You know? This is a fantastic reaction from someone,very genuine video that they&#39;ve shot in their back garden.But how do you find if this person, if it&#39;s true, if it&#39;s faked,or if it&#39;s something that&#39;s old and that&#39;s been reposted?

zh-cn:所以我们开始对这段视频进行核实一开始我们掌握的唯一信息就是一个YouTube的用户名。用户名是Rita Krill，这个账户也只上传过一个视频。我们不知道Rita是否真的存在还是仅仅是一个假名。所以我们利用免费的因特网工具开始调查。寻找Rita Krills的时候我们用到的第一个工具是Spokeo。我们在全美范围内搜索叫Rita Krills的人在纽约、宾夕法尼亚、内华达和弗罗里达都有发现。接下来我们使用了第二个名叫Wolfram Alpha的免费网络工具，查到了视频上传当天各地的天气，依次检查过所有有Rita Krill居住的城市之后，我们发现弗罗里达那天有雷暴和大雨。然后我们找到电话簿开始查询在其中找到好几个Rita Krills的地址我们在谷歌地图上检索了她们的地址，并且找到了一幢类似的房子。这座房子也有游泳池很Rita的十分相似。我们再次观看视频寻找可以对照的线索。仔细看视频的话你就会发现这里有一把很大的遮阳伞，游泳池里有一个白色的气垫，游泳池的角形状比较特别，背景里有两棵树。我们再次打开谷歌地图，仔细核对这是白色的气垫这是两棵树这是遮阳伞。在这找图片里这把伞没有撑开。所以不容易看出来。这是游泳池有弧度的角。随后我们致电Rita，核实真伪，确定是她拍摄了这段视频，随后我们的客户就可以放心的使用这条素材了。
en:So we set about going to work on this video, andthe only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account.There was only one video posted to that account,and the username was Rita Krill.And we didn&#39;t know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name.But we started looking, and we used free Internet tools to do so.The first one was called Spokeo, which allowed us to look for Rita Krills.So we looked all over the U.S. We found them in New York,we found them in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Florida.So we went and we looked for a second free Internet toolcalled Wolfram Alpha, and we checked the weather reportsfor the day in which this video had been uploaded,and when we went through all those various cities,we found that in Florida, there were thunderstorms and rain on the day.So we went to the white pages, and we found,we looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook,and we looked through a couple of different addresses,and that took us to Google Maps, where we found a house.And we found a house with a swimming pool that lookedremarkably like Rita&#39;s. So we went back to the video,and we had to look for clues that we could cross-reference.So if you look in the video, there&#39;s the big umbrella,there&#39;s a white lilo in the pool,there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool,and there&#39;s two trees in the background.And we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer,and sure enough, there&#39;s the white lilo,there are the two trees,there&#39;s the umbrella. It&#39;s actually folded in this photo.Little bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool.So we were able to call Rita, clear the video,make sure that it had been shot, and then our clientswere delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.

zh-cn:有时候追寻真相没有这么轻松，而是会带来深远的后果。我们一直对叙利亚很感兴趣你经常需要甄别那些可能构成战争犯罪证据的素材在这一方面，YouTube确实存储了全世界范围内的大量时事信息。
en:Sometimes the search for truth, though,is a little bit less flippant, and it has much greater consequences.Syria has been really interesting for us, because obviouslya lot of the time you&#39;re trying to debunk stuff that can bepotentially war crime evidence, so this is where YouTubeactually becomes the most important repositoryof information about what&#39;s going on in the world.
时间： 9:20
zh-cn:接下来这个视频画面相当血腥所以我就不完整播放了，不过你们可以听到声音。这个事件发生在哈马（叙利亚西部城市）。播放视频：（喊叫声）这个视频的完整版记录的是人们从小货车上卸下血淋淋的尸体然后从桥上扔进河里。有传言说这些人来自穆斯林联盟正在将叙利亚军队士官的尸体从桥上扔下去，一边扔嘴里还在诅咒，说一些渎神的话，但是，关于他们的身份，以及视频对他们的表现是否真实都有人持不同意见。
en:So this video, I&#39;m not going to show you the whole thing,because it&#39;s quite gruesome, but you&#39;ll hear some of the sounds.This is from Hama.Video: (Shouting)And what this video shows, when you watch the whole thing through,is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truckand thrown off a bridge.The allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhoodand they were throwing Syrian Army officers&#39; bodiesoff the bridge, and they were cursing and using blasphemous language,and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were,and whether or not they were what the video said it was.
时间： 9:53
zh-cn:所以我们找到了一些曾经在推特上和我们交流的线人问他们对这个视频有什么看法，我们对这座桥特别感兴趣，因为它相对容易辨识。三个线人对这座桥作出了不同的判断。第一个人说这座桥根本不存在。第二个人说这座桥确实存在，但是不在哈马，在其它地方。第三个人说，“我觉得这座桥确实存在，但是河流上游的堤坝是关闭的，所以这条河应该是干的，视频与此矛盾。“最后一个线人给了我们一些线索。我们仔细观看视频寻找其他的线索。我们找到了这种独特的栏杆，可以用来对照辨识。我们观察了路牙。路牙的影子朝南，所以这座桥是东西向横跨河流的。路牙黑白相间。我们再看这条河，可以发现西边有混凝土石，水中有一滩血迹。从血迹可以看出这条河从南向北流动。我们从视频中提炼出了这些信息。从桥上看出去可以发现何的左岸有一块草皮，而且河流的宽度显著缩小。
en:So we talked to some sources in Hama who we had beenback and forth with on Twitter, and we asked them about this,and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify.Three different sources said three different things about the bridge.They said, one, the bridge doesn&#39;t exist.Another one said the bridge does exist, but it&#39;s not in Hama. It&#39;s somewhere else.And the third one said, &quot;I think the bridge does exist,but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed,so the river should actually have been dry, so this doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot;So that was the only one that gave us a clue.We looked through the video for other clues.We saw the distinctive railings, which we could use.We looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south,so we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river.It had black-and-white curbs.As we looked at the river itself, you could see there&#39;sa concrete stone on the west side. There&#39;s a cloud of blood.That&#39;s blood in the river. So the river is flowingsouth to north. That&#39;s what that tells me.And also, as you look away from the bridge,there&#39;s a divot on the left-hand side of the bank,and the river narrows.
时间：10:50
zh-cn:所以我们用谷歌地图开始检查每一座桥。我们找到线人提到的水坝然而检查每一次道路与河流相交的地方，划掉那些不符合描述的桥梁。我们要找东西向横跨河流的桥。我们从大坝一直检查到哈马都没有找到符合要求的桥梁。所以我们又继续努力。我们用卫星图像对照找到了一座桥，与所有描述一一对应。这座桥东西向横跨河流。所以很可能就是视频里那座。我们放大视图。我们能看到中线，所以这是一座两车道的桥。和视频中一样，它的人行道也是黑白相间的再点击一下，我们发现有人上传了桥的照片，大大方便了我们的工作，我们打开这些照片，找到了更多可以与视频对照的细节。我们第一个看到的就是这黑白相间的路牙，很有价值，因为我们之前也找到过类似的证据。我们看到那些人扔尸体时越过的、花纹独特的栏杆。进一步的比较对照证明这就是我们要找的那座桥。
en:So onto Google Maps we go, and we startlooking through literally every single bridge.We go to the dam that we talked about, we start justliterally going through every time that road crosses the river,crossing off the bridges that don&#39;t match.We&#39;re looking for one that crosses east-west.And we get to Hama. We get all the way from the damto Hama and there&#39;s no bridge.So we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view,and we find another bridge, and everything starts to line up.The bridge looks like it&#39;s crossing the river east to west.So this could be our bridge. And we zoom right in.We start to see that it&#39;s got a median, so it&#39;s a two-lane bridge.And it&#39;s got the black-and-white curbs that we saw in the video,and as we click through it, you can see someone&#39;suploaded photos to go with the map, which is very handy,so we click into the photos. And the photos start showing usmore detail that we can cross-reference with the video.The first thing that we see is we see black-and-white curbing,which is handy because we&#39;ve seen that before.We see the distinctive railing that we saw the guysthrowing the bodies over.And we keep going through it until we&#39;re certain that this is our bridge.
时间：11:52
zh-cn:这样的结果对我有什么意义呢？我现在必须重新看看我的三个线人都给我提供了什么样的信息：一个说桥不存在一个说桥不在哈马还有一个说”是的，有这座桥，但是我不确定现在水位如何。“现在第三个人看起来最为可靠，我们坐在都柏林的办公室小隔间里使用免费的因特网工具只要二十分钟就可以得出这样的结论。这是相当有趣的。尽管网络信息好似洪流数量非常巨大，筛选越来越难，但如果你明智的使用网络，就能找到超乎想象的信息。给我一两条线索，我就能找到在座各位很多不想被人发现的信息。
en:So what does that tell me? I&#39;ve got to go back nowto my three sources and look at what they told me:the one who said the bridge didn&#39;t exist,the one who said the bridge wasn&#39;t in Hama,and the one guy who said, &quot;Yes, the bridge does exist, but I&#39;m not sure about the water levels.&quot;Number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden,and we&#39;ve been able to find that out using some free Internet toolssitting in a cubicle in an office in Dublinin the space of 20 minutes.And that&#39;s part of the joy of this. Although the webis running like a torrent, there&#39;s so much information therethat it&#39;s incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day,if you use them intelligently, you can find out incredible information.Given a couple of clues, I could probably find outa lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out.

en:But here&#39;s the thing. Algorithms are rules. They&#39;re binary.They&#39;re yes or no, they&#39;re black or white.Truth is never binary. Truth is a value.Truth is emotional, it&#39;s fluid, and above all, it&#39;s human.No matter how quick we get with computers, no matterhow much information we have, you&#39;ll never be ableto remove the human from the truth-seeking exercise,because in the end, it is a uniquely human trait.Thanks very much.
