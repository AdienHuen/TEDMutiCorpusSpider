zh-cn:请看这张图片。它带给我们一个极具吸引力的谜。这些非洲学生在做功课在首都机场的街灯下因为他们家里没有电。我还没见过这几个学生本人但我见过像他们一样的学生。
en:Take a look at this picture.It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.These African students are doing their homeworkunder streetlights at the airport in the capital citybecause they don&#39;t have any electricity at home.Now, I haven&#39;t met these particular students,but I&#39;ve met students like them.

zh-cn:拿那个穿绿衬衫的学生做例子，假设他的名字叫做Nelson。我猜他肯定有个手机有趣的是，为什么Nelson有机会享用像手机这样的前沿科技成果但却不能在家用上电力？人们早在100年前就已经发明了这一科技啊？
en:Let&#39;s just pick one — for example, the one in the green shirt.Let&#39;s give him a name, too: Nelson.I&#39;ll bet Nelson has a cellphone.So here is the puzzle.Why is it that Nelson has accessto a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,but doesn&#39;t have access to a 100-year-old technologyfor generating electric light in the home?

zh-cn:答案是“制度”。不健全的制度会妨碍这种双赢节决办法的产生（比如）人们在一定的制度之下就不会将科技带给像Nelson这样的人什么样的制度呢？这个国家的电力公司需要遵守一条制度这个制度要求它在政府补贴的条件下从用户收取极其低价电费事实上，电费便宜到另电力公司亏损的地步所以，电力公司既没有资源，也没有动机去给用户接通电源
en:Now, in a word, the answer is &quot;rules.&quot;Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that&#39;s availablewhen people can bring new technologies inand make them available to someone like Nelson.What kinds of rules?The electric company in this nationoperates under a rule, which says that it has to sellelectricity at a very low, subsidized price —in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,to hook up many other users.

zh-cn:总统想要改变这个局面他已经觉察到更换体制是具可能性的。能让商家盈利的体制才能使（商家）有动机争取更多用户卖Nelson的手机的那个厂家也正式在（让商家盈利）制度下经营着总统已经领会到（让商家盈利的）制度运行良好所以他尝试着改变现行的（补贴）电价制度但来自商人以及消费者的反对的声音四起他们想保留现行的补贴电费制度总统无能为力，只能任由现行制度阻止双赢局面产生，任由它妨碍改善国家因此，Nelson也只能在街灯下学习
en:The president wanted to change this rule.He&#39;s seen that it&#39;s possible to have a different set of rules,rules where businesses earn a small profit,so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.That&#39;s the kind of rules that the cellphone companythat Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.The president has seen how those rules worked well.So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,but ran into a firestorm of protestfrom businesses and consumerswho wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.So he was stuck with rules that prevented himfrom letting the win-win solution help his country.And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.

zh-cn:真正具有挑战性的是尝试寻找改变制度的办法我们可不可以发展“改变制度”的制度呢？我想说，我们可以把抽象化为实际或者说，如果我们给予人民更多选择给予领导者更多选择，领导者在很多国家也是人民么（笑）但，（领袖和人民）两者间的对立还是有必要解释的因为你想给予领袖的自由是像那种你给予总统提高电价（的权力）一样的自由剥夺人民在这个经济体系中的需求自由（人民）希望可以继续享用补贴电价的自由所以如果你只选取一方，或另一方你将面临矛盾或摩擦但如果我们相办法同时给两者自由那么就会产生能使我们摆脱困境的制度
en:The real challenge then, is to try to figure outhow we can change rules.Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?I want to argue that there is a general abstract insightthat we can make practical,which is that, if we can give more choices to people,and more choices to leaders —who, in many countries, are also people.(Laughter)But, it&#39;s useful to present the opposition between these two.Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,a choice like giving the president the choiceto raise prices on electricity,takes away a choice that people in the economy want.They want the choice to be able to continue consumingsubsidized electric power.So if you give just to one side or the other,you&#39;ll have tension or friction.But if we can find ways to give more choices to both,that will give us a set of rulesfor changing rules that get us out of traps.

zh-cn:Nelson现在还可以享用互联网他说如果你想看到制度的破坏性制度怎样陷人民于黑暗中看一看美国家宇航局拍摄的地球夜景特别注意一下亚洲放大这里可以看到北朝鲜，在这儿比起它的邻居，北朝鲜就像个黑洞你不会惊讶北朝鲜的制度将人民陷于黑暗
en:Now, Nelson also has access to the Internet.And he says that if you want to seethe damaging effects of rules,the ways that rules can keep people in the dark,look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.In particular check out Asia.If you zoom in here,you can see North Korea, in outline here,which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.Now, you won&#39;t be surprised to learnthat the rules in North Koreakeep people there in the dark.

zh-cn:重要的是要承认南北朝鲜曾有一模一样的制度不论法律上还是政策上而且在深层理解上准则，文化，价值，信仰南北分隔时，南北朝鲜做出了引领它们走向不同道路的选择由不同的制度而产生因而我们可以改变，我们，人类，可以改变制度人际交往与相处的制度使之变得更好，或更坏
en:But it is important to recognizethat North Korea and South Koreastarted out with identical sets of rulesin both the sense of laws and regulations,but also in the deeper senses of understandings,norms, culture, values and beliefs.When they separated, they made choicesthat led to very divergent pathsfor their sets of rules.So we can change — we as humans can change the rulesthat we use to interact with each other,for better, or for worse.

zh-cn:现在来看看另外一个地区，加勒比海域放大海地 （国名）在这儿海地也在黑暗中和邻国多米尼加共和国相比同样的人口总数但这两个国家和波多黎各比，也处于黑暗中波多黎各人口总数大概是海地或多米尼亚共和国的一半左右海地提醒了我们体制可因薄弱的政府而不健全而不完全是因为政府太强制，比如北朝鲜因此如果我们想要创建良好政策的环境我们不能总是破坏我们需要相办法建设
en:Now let&#39;s look at another region, the Caribbean.Zoom in on Haiti,in outline here.Haiti is also dark,compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic,which has about the same number of residents.Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,which has half as many residentsas either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.What Haiti warns us is thatrules can be bad because governments are weak.It&#39;s not just that the rules are bad becausethe government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.So that if we want to create environments with good rules,we can&#39;t just tear down.We&#39;ve got to find ways to build up, as well.

zh-cn:看，中国强烈地展示了体制改革带来的潜力和挑战在这图表数据（被采集）的时期，中国是世界高科技的前沿例如钢铁，印刷，火药但中国从未采用，至少那个时期任何有效的措施来鼓励这些想法的传播或者一个盈利的动机来鼓励传播中国很快采用了延缓创新的措施然后与世界隔离，自闭门户所以在其它国家创新时，在发展新科技和新制度的层面上时中国已经与这些进步脱离了脚步国民收入停滞成为了一个非常落后的国度
en:Now, China dramatically demonstratesboth the potential and the challengesof working with rules.Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,China was the world&#39;s high-technology leader.Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas —a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.And they soon adopted rules whichslowed down innovationand cut China off from the rest of the world.So as other countries in the world innovated,in the sense both of developingnewer technologies,but also developing newer rules,the Chinese were cut off from those advances.Income there stayed stagnant,as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.

zh-cn:这个图表展示较新的数据它展示了收入，中国的平均收入与之美国的平均收入百分比五六十年代，你可以看到它徘徊在3％左右但七十年代，情况变了中国开始发展，开始迅速地追赶上美国
en:This next chart looks at more recent data.It plots income, average income in Chinaas a percentage of average income in the United States.In the &#39;50s and &#39;60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.But then in the late &#39;70s something changed.Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching upvery quickly with the United States.

zh-cn:如果你晚上看这个地图， 你会发现导致中国体制急速变化的原因中国最明亮的地域你可以在轮廓的边际看到是香港香港其实是中国很小的一块地方在二十世纪的绝大部分时期都在非常不同的体制下治理着与大陆其它地方都不同体制是从当时（英国）有效的市场经济复制出来的并由英国治理
en:If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clueto the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.The brightest spot in China,which you can see on the edge of the outline here,is Hong Kong.Hong Kong was a small bit of Chinathat, for most of the 20th century,operated under a very different set of rulesthan the rest of mainland China —rules that were copiedfrom working market economies of the time,and administered by the British.
时间： 6:46
zh-cn:于19世纪五十年代，香港是百万大陆人去找像缝纫，制作玩具之类工作的地方但要想提高收入提高技术促进（经济）飞速增长香港也是像邓小平这样的领导者想要使大陆走向市场经济时要模仿的经济模型
en:In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place wheremillions of people could go, from the mainland,to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.But, to get on a process of increasing income,increasing skillsled to very rapid growth there.Hong Kong was also the modelwhich leaders like Deng Xiaopingcould copy, when they decided to moveall of the mainland towards the market model.
时间： 7:15
zh-cn:但邓小平本能地理解给予人民自由的重要性所以邓不是一下子放手让中国立即走向市场经济他先设立了特别行政区这样就可以模仿英国提供可以运行市场经济的机会向那些想要这个机会的人们所以他们创建了围绕香港的四个特殊经济开发区中国人可以去那里工作那里城市迅速发展并且外商涌入制造产品
en:But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understoodthe importance of offering choices to his people.So instead of forcing everyone in Chinato shift immediately to the market model,they proceeded by creating some special zonesthat could do, in a sense, what Britain did:make the opportunity to go work with the market rulesavailable to the people who wanted to opt in there.So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:zones where Chinese could come and work,and cities grew up very rapidly there;also zones where foreign firms could come inand make things.

zh-cn:香港旁边有个地区叫深圳深圳有个台湾公司制造你们每人都有的iPhone使用中国的劳动力那些移民到深圳的劳工所以在四个特别行政区以后有14个滨海城市向这样对外开放最终成功在这些人们选择移居的地方其实人们是因为机遇和条件而蜂拥而至这些（特别行政区）的成功引起共识带领整个经济体制走向市场经济
en:One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.In that city there is a Taiwanese firmthat made the iPhone that many of you have,and they made it with labor from Chinesewho moved there to Shenzhen.So after the four special zones,there were 14 coastal citesthat were open in the same sense,and eventually demonstrated successesin these places that people could opt in to,that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus fora move toward the market model for the entire economy.

zh-cn:现在中国的这些例子证明以下几点：一：留给人民自由二：在恰当的规模下操作如果你想在一个村庄改变体制，可以，但一个村的规模太小了不能带给你如同让百万人一样的效应在优质体制的治理下另一方面，一下子改变全国的体制又太大了如果你想改变国家体制有一部分人必然得不到照顾他们也没有机会去评估新政的优劣（无法）给人民一个聚焦未来，尝试新体制的机会但像城市就能给你这些机会来创建新领域开拓新体制，人们可以选择（尝试这个体制）并且（城市这个规模）足够大大到我们能得到应有的当百万人在新体制治理下应有的效应
en:Now the Chinese example shows us several points.One is: preserve choices for people.Two: operate on the right scale.If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,but a village would be too smallto get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of peopleall working under good rules.On the other hand, the nation is too big.If you try to change the rules in the nation,you can&#39;t give some people a chanceto hold back, see how things turn out,and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.But cities give you this opportunityto create new places,with new rules that people can opt in to.And they&#39;re large enoughto get all of the benefits that we can havewhen millions of us work together under good rules.

zh-cn:所以我提议我们设想一种叫做“特别市”的东西首先（设立）纲领详细说明所有的条例规则来吸引那些建设特别市的人才我们需要吸引投资商他们会建设基础设施（比如）能源系统，公路，码头，机场，楼房你需要吸引商家他们会来聘用最先移居特别市的人们你需要吸引家庭那些会来长期居住的人抚养小孩，供他们受教育开始他们的事业
en:So the proposal is that weconceive of something called a charter city.We start with a charter that specifiesall the rules requiredto attract the people who we&#39;ll need to build the city.We&#39;ll need to attract the investorswho will build out the infrastructure —the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.You&#39;ll need to attract firms,who will come hire the people who move there first.And you&#39;ll need to attract families,the residents who will come and live there permanently,raise their children, get an education for their children,and get their first job.
时间： 9:44
zh-cn:在这样的纲领下，人们会移居那里城市才能建立起来我们还可以改善这个模型的规模我们可以一遍又一遍地（尝试）要想成功，我们需要完善地体制。我们已经讨论过了这些（体制）将在纲领中体现出来我们还需要给人们自由去选择（自由选择）是真正融入了这个模型（的精髓）如果我们允许在无人居住的土地上建设城市的话你从荒芜的领地开始人们可以移居那里开始新的纲领但没有人是被迫的最后，我们需要给领导者自由去选择
en:With that charter, people will move there.The city can be built.And we can scale this model.We can go do it over and over again.To make it work, we need good rules. We&#39;ve already discussed that.Those are captured in the charter.We also need the choices for people.That&#39;s really built into the modelif we allow for the possibility of building citieson uninhabited land.You start from uninhabited territory.People can come live under the new charter,but no one is forced to live under it.The final thing we need are choices for leaders.
时间：10:20
zh-cn:要做到给领导者自由我们需要允许国家间的合作让不同的国家可以合作事实上像中国和英国合作（于香港一例）一样来首先建设一个市场经济的飞地然后扩大至整个中国或多或少，英国，不经意地在上个世纪它治理香港期间对削减世界贫困上做出了比任何支援项目都更为卓越的贡献所以只要我们允许这样的合作重演我们可以将这个效应扩大的整个世界的规模
en:And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaderswe need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:cases where nations work together,in effect, de facto,the way China and Britain worked togetherto build, first a little enclave of the market model,and then scale it throughout China.In a sense, Britain, inadvertently,through its actions in Hong Kong,did more to reduce world povertythan all the aid programs that we&#39;ve undertakenin the last century.So if we allow for these kind of partnershipsto replicate this again,we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.

zh-cn:有时这需要委派职责一种从一个国家到另外一个国家的责任的委派来执行某些行政管理的职责我这么说你们中有些人可能开始想“那，不是要恢复殖民主义吗？”不是的。但是认识到这种情绪却是重要的我们开始考虑这些时，这些情绪将产生（这些情绪）会阻碍我们扼杀我们的能力（打击）我们探索新想法的兴趣
en:In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility,a delegation of control from one country to anotherto take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.Now, when I say that,some of you are starting to think,&quot;Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?&quot;It&#39;s not. But it&#39;s important to recognize that the kind of emotionsthat come up when we start to think about these things,can get in the way, can make us pull back,can shut down our ability,and our interest in trying to explore new ideas.
时间：11:33
zh-cn:为什么这不是殖民主义？殖民主义的弊病以及支援项目遗留的弊端是它具有强迫和屈尊的元素但（我提议的这个）模型的核心是自由选择无论是对领导者来说，还是对来移居的人民来说这自由选择恰恰正是强迫和屈尊的解药
en:Why is this not like colonialism?The thing that was bad about colonialism,and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,is that it involved elements ofcoercion and condescension.This model is all about choices,both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.

zh-cn:那么我们来谈谈怎样实际操作拿卡斯特罗来说——他是古巴的领袖做例子卡斯特罗一定意识到他有机会对古巴采用像邓小平对中国一样的政策但古巴这个岛国没有像香港一样的地方南方倒有一处明亮的地方具有非常特殊的意义在关塔那摩湾区域一个条约给予美国行政管理的权力对这足有曼哈顿两倍大小的地方
en:So let&#39;s talk about how this could play out in practice.Let&#39;s take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.It must have occurred to Castrothat he has the chance to do for Cubawhat Deng Xiaoping did for China,but he doesn&#39;t have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the souththat has a very special status.There is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay,where a treaty gives the United Statesadministrative responsibilityfor a piece of land that&#39;s about twice the size of Manhattan.

zh-cn:卡斯特罗对加拿大总理说“看，美国佬在公共关系上有问题他们要退出了你为什么不接手呢？管理一个特别的行政区让新城市建设在那里让人们住进来让我们附近有一个像香港一样的城市我的公民会移居那里也有人不会。但这将成为会连通现代经济和现代世界的门户对我的国家来说。”
en:Castro goes to the prime minister of Canadaand says, &quot;Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.They want to get out.Why don&#39;t you, Canada, take over?Build — run a special administrative zone.Allow a new city to be built up there.Allow many people to come in.Let us have a Hong Kong nearby.Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.Others will hold back. But this will bethe gateway that will connectthe modern economy and the modern worldto my country.&quot;
时间：13:03
zh-cn:现在，还有哪里尝试过这个模型？非洲。我曾和非洲的领导者沟通过他们很多人都完全理解特别行政区的含义人们可以选择体制这是个为改变体制而建立的体制这是个创建新制度，让人民选择的办法没有压迫，也没有可以去压迫的反抗（非洲领导者）也完全理解在某些情况下他们可以向长期投资商做出更由权威的承诺那些将会修建码头的投资商修建公路，在新城市
en:Now, where else might this model be tried?Well, Africa. I&#39;ve talked with leaders in Africa.Many of them totally get the notion of a special zonethat people can opt into as a rule.It&#39;s a rule for changing rules.It&#39;s a way to create new rules, and let people opt-inwithout coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.They also totally get the idea that in some instancesthey can make more credible promises to long-term investors —the kind of investors who will come build the port,build the roads, in a new city —
时间：13:36
zh-cn:他们可以做出更有信服力的承诺如果他们与另外一个国家合作甚至在某些安排中，这有点像代管账户你把地产投入代管账户合作国从而负责管理这个账户非洲还有很多地新城市可以建设在这些地上这张照片是我在海湾上空拍摄的像这样的广阔的地有很多成百上千的人可以居住让我们概括并思考不是一两个，而是几十个特别市能提供上百万，或许上亿人在下个世纪移居到特别市
en:they can make more credible promisesif they do it along with a partner nation.Perhaps even in some arrangementthat&#39;s a little bit like an escrow account,where you put land in the escrow accountand the partner nation takes responsibility for it.There is also lots of land in Africawhere new cities could be built.This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.There are immense stretches of land like this —land where hundreds of millions of people could live.Now, if we generalize this and think aboutnot just one or two charter cites, but dozens —cities that will help create places for themany hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of peoplewho will move to cities in the coming century —

en:is there enough land for them?Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,the one thing that&#39;s misleading is that, visually, it lookslike most of the world is already built out.So let me show you why that&#39;s wrong.Take this representation of all of the land.Turn it into a square that stands forall the arable land on Earth.And let these dots represent the land that&#39;s already taken upby the cities that three billion people now live in.If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangleyou can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residentstake up only three percent of the arable land on earth.

zh-cn:如果我们想再建设些城市来容纳10亿居民他们会像这些点一样我们从占用3％可耕种土地到占用4％通过建设城市，并且让住在农村的人可以移居城市我们将急剧减少人类在地球上的足迹如果这些城市在完善的体制下治理他们可以成为人们远离犯罪、疾病以及低劣的卫生条件人们可以找工作可以有起码的公共服务，比如用电孩子可以受教育
en:So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people,they would be dots like this.We&#39;d go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.We&#39;d dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earthby building more cities that people can move to.And if these are cities governed by good rules,they can be cities where people are safe from crime,safe from disease and bad sanitation,where people have a chance to get a job.They can get basic utilities like electricity.Their kids can get an education.
时间：15:20
zh-cn:我们需要什么来开始（这个工程）呢？开始建设第一批特别市然后扩大规模，建设更多？有一个“用户使用指南”还是很有必要的（笑）大学教授能做到的是写一些可以被写入指南的细节你或许不让我们治理这些城市出去设计它们你或许不让学者走出象牙塔
en:So what will it take to get startedbuilding the first charter cities,scaling this so we build many more?It would help to have a manual.(Laughter)What university professors could dois write some details that might go into this manual.You wouldn&#39;t want to let us run the cities,go out and design them.You wouldn&#39;t let academics out in the wild.

en:But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like,suppose it isn&#39;t just Canadathat does the deal with Raul Castro.Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant,and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to beone of the partners in a four-way joint venture.How would we write the treaty to do that?There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.

zh-cn:我们怎么融资？事实上新加坡和香港还有其它在地产增值时捞上一大笔的一些城市你可以用地产的盈利来支付像警察，法院之类的设施还有教育和医疗系统让它成为让人向往居住的地方让它成为高收入的地方这样也会使得地产增值更高所以对这些建设这区域，设立基础纲领的人的奖励是完全合适的
en:How would we finance this?Turns out Singapore and Hong Kongare cities that made huge gainson the value of the land that they owned when they got started.You could use the gains on the value of the landto pay for things like the police, the courts,but the school system and the health care system too,which make this a more attractive place to live,makes this a place where people have higher incomes —which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zoneand build it, and set up the basic rules,go very much in the right direction.

zh-cn:还有很多像这样的细节我们怎样才能给那些靠组装iPhone的工人像那样的一类人群如何为他们提供他们有能力买得起的楼房？而且要让这楼房节能安全，不能塌下来比如说在地震或飓风的时候很多细节还要再疏理我们中间有些人已经在追逐这样的梦了他们可以告诉你，没有办不到的，只有想不到的只有匮乏的想像力会阻碍我们发掘出可以带来真正的全球双赢的方案
en:So there are many other details like this.How could we have buildings that arelow cost and affordable for people who workin a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,but make those buildings energy efficient,and make sure that they are safe, so they don&#39;t fall downin an earthquake or a hurricane.Many technical details to be worked out,but those of us who are already starting to pursue these thingscan already tell that there is no roadblock,there&#39;s no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,that will keep us from delivering ona truly global win-win solution.

en:Let me conclude with this picture.The reason we can be so well off,even though there is so many people on earth,is because of the power of ideas.We can share ideas with other people,and when they discover them, they share with us.It&#39;s not like scarce objects,where sharing means we each get less.When we share ideas we all get more.When we think about ideas in that way,we usually think about technologies.
