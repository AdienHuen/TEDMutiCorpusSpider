zh-cn:我要在接下来的18分钟内与大家分享一个不可思议的愿景一个非常雄伟的愿景不过首先我想请在座各位闭上双眼在几秒钟内想一想某种技术或者科学在你看来，改变了世界我打赌，这里所有的观众你一定想到了某种神奇的技术某种我甚至没听说过的玩意儿绝对是的但我同时也确信，非常肯定绝对没有人想到它这是一支脊髓灰质炎疫苗
en:I want to share with youover the next 18 minutesa pretty incredible idea.Actually, it&#39;s a really big idea.But to get us started,I want to ask if everyonecould just close your eyes for two secondsand try and think of a technology or a bit of sciencethat you think has changed the world.Now I bet, in this audience,you&#39;re thinking of some really incredible technology,some stuff that I haven&#39;t even heard of,I&#39;m absolutely sure.But I&#39;m also sure, pretty sure,that absolutely nobody is thinking of this.This is a polio vaccine.

zh-cn:其实，这很好今天在座没人想到它是因为我们已将它视为理所当然这是一项伟大的技术我们可以完全地应用它但是过去并不是这样甚至就在这里，加利福尼亚如果退后几十年情况可大不相同当时，人们惧怕这种疾病他们十分害怕脊髓灰质炎，它能引起公众惊恐原因就如图中所示在这张图片里人们生活在铁制的肺中这些人，两三天前还相当健康可几天后便丧失呼吸功能脊髓灰质炎病毒不仅仅瘫痪了他们的四肢就连控制呼吸的肌肉也不放过通常，他们的余生都得在铁肺里度过
en:And it&#39;s a great thing actuallythat nobody&#39;s had to think about it here todaybecause it means that we can take this for granted.This is a great technology.We can take it completely for granted.But it wasn&#39;t always that way.Even here in California,if we were to go back just a few years,it was a very different story.People were terrified of this disease.They were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.And it was because of scenes like this.In this scene,people are living in an iron lung.These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before,and then two days later,they can no longer breathe,and this polio virus has paralyzednot only their arms and their legs,but also their breathing muscles.And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually,in this iron lung to breathe for them.

zh-cn:这个疾病十分可怕当时却没有疗法也没有疫苗这个疾病如此恐怖以至于当时的美国总统发动了一场声势浩大的全国运动来试图阻止它的传播二十年后，他们成功地开发出脊髓灰质炎疫苗这被视为科学奇迹当时是20世纪50年代末终于，有一种疫苗能够阻止这种可怕的疾病在美国它有着惊人的影响力正如我们所知，病毒被遏制并且很快被遏制
en:This disease was terrifying.There was no cure,and there was no vaccine.The disease was so terrifyingthat the president of the United Stateslaunched an extraordinary national effortto find a way to stop it.Twenty years later, they succeededand developed the polio vaccine.It was hailed as a scientific miraclein the late 1950s.Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease,and here in the United Statesit had an incredible impact.As you can see, the virus stopped,and it stopped very, very fast.

en:Bruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio&#39;s almost been eradicated.But the reality isthat polio still exists today.We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.This is the picture.There&#39;s not very much left in the world.But the reason there&#39;s not very much leftis because there&#39;s been an extraordinary public/private partnershipworking behind the scenes, almost unknown,I&#39;m sure to most of you here today.It&#39;s been working for 20 yearsto try and eradicate this disease,and it&#39;s got it down to these few casesthat you can see here on this graphic.

zh-cn:但就在去年我们被强烈震动我们似乎总是做得不够难以应对像脊髓灰质炎这样的病毒原因如下有两个国家十多年未出现脊髓灰质炎它们各位于地球两端却突然都爆发了严重的脊髓灰质炎数百人瘫痪死亡人数上百—儿童和成年人都成了受害者在这两个国家我们都运用了基因排序的方法来观察查病毒发现这些病毒并不是来自本土他们从几千公里外的地方远道而来其中一个国家的病毒竟来自于另一个大陆不仅如此，当他们进入这些国家后很可能又登上了商务航班飞到了更远的地方如俄罗斯在那里，去年，十多年来第一次有儿童因脊髓灰质炎而瘫痪而当地已多年未见这种疾病
en:But just last year,we had an incredible shockand realized that almost just isn&#39;t good enoughwith a virus like polio.And this is the reason:in two countriesthat hadn&#39;t had this disease for more than probably a decade,on opposite sides of the globe,there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.Hundreds of people were paralyzed.Hundreds of people died —children as well as adults.And in both cases,we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses,and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.They had come from thousands of miles away.And in one case, it originated on another continent.And not only that, but when they came into these countries,then they got on commercial jetliners probablyand they traveled even fartherto other places like Russia,where, for the first time in over a decade last year,children were crippled and paralyzedby a disease that they had not seen for years.

en:Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you,these are under control now,and it looks like they&#39;ll probably stop very, very quickly.But the message was very clear.Polio is stilla devastating, explosive disease.It&#39;s just happening in another part of the world.And our big ideais that the scientific miracle of this decadeshould be the complete eradicationof poliomyelitis.

zh-cn:在这里，我想要介绍一下之前提到的合作伙伴组织，脊髓灰质炎合作机构当前的工作我们不是单纯去控制脊髓灰质炎将它的发病率降低到极低因为这种疾病就像是火种若不完全熄灭，它随时可能爆发因此我们寻求的是一种永久的解决方案我们希望在这个世界，每个孩子，都能像在座各位一样不用再为脊髓灰质炎而担心是的，我们在寻找一种永久的解决方案幸运的是脊髓灰质炎属于这样一种少见的病毒类其本身带有一定缺陷让人类可以攻克，并取得伟大成就脊髓灰质炎病毒只能在人体中存活并且存活时间很短它在自然界中几乎无法生存我们有很有效的疫苗，我刚才已展示给各位此我们正努力彻底根除这种病毒脊髓灰质炎根除项目正试图根除这种病毒本身来防止导致脊髓灰质炎在地球上肆意蔓延
en:So I want to tell you a little bitabout what this partnership, the Polio Partnership,is trying to do.We&#39;re not trying to control polio.We&#39;re not trying to get it down to just a few cases,because this disease is like a root fire;it can explode again if you don&#39;t snuff it out completely.So what we&#39;re looking foris a permanent solution.We want a world in which every child, just like you guys,can take for granteda polio-free world.So we&#39;re looking for a permanent solution,and this is where we get lucky.This is one of the very few viruses in the worldwhere there are big enough cracks in its armorthat we can try to do something truly extraordinary.This virus can only survive in people.It can&#39;t live for a very long time in people.It doesn&#39;t survive in the environment hardly at all.And we&#39;ve got pretty good vaccines, as I&#39;ve just showed you.So we are tryingto wipe out this virus completely.What the polio eradication program is trying to dois to kill the virus itselfthat causes polioeverywhere on Earth.

zh-cn:我们并不擅长根除疾病这样的任务上个世纪我们尝试了六次但只有一次真正成功因为疾病根除仍是公众健康的风险资金风险是巨大的但回报无论从经济，全人类，还是推动力来看也都是巨大的美国一位国会议员认为美国投入的用以根除天花的全部投资每26天就能收回一次成本通过抵消治疗成本和疫苗的成本如果我们能够完全根除小儿麻痹症世界上最穷的那些国家则将节省500亿美元时间是仅在未来的25年内这就是我们追求的利益
en:Now we don&#39;t have a great track recordwhen it comes to doing something like this,to eradicating diseases.It&#39;s been tried six times in the last century,and it&#39;s been successful exactly once.And this is because disease eradication,it&#39;s still the venture capital of public health.The risks are massive,but the pay-off —economic, humanitarian, motivational —it&#39;s absolutely huge.One congressman here in the United Statesthinks that the entire investmentthat the U.S. put into smallpox eradicationpays itself off every 26 days —in foregone treatment costsand vaccination costs.And if we can finish polio eradication,the poorest countries in the worldare going to save over 50 billion dollarsin the next 25 years alone.So those are the kind of stakes that we&#39;re after.
时间： 6:48
zh-cn:但是根除天花的过程是很困难的相当，相当艰难而要根除小儿麻痹症，从很多方面来讲，还要难这里有几个因素首先我们开始尝试根除脊髓灰质炎时时间大概是20年前当时，被其感染的国家数量是开始根除天花之际的两倍多而感染脊髓灰质炎国家的人口数超过感染天花的10倍因此当时的努力是艰巨的我们面临的第二个挑战是—脊髓灰质炎疫苗与天花疫苗性质不同天花疫苗性质稳定，打一次就终身免疫而脊髓灰质炎疫苗是否脆弱在赤道地区，它很快变质我们必须将特殊的疫苗检测器安在每支疫苗上因此它能迅速做出反应当疫苗因为受热过多而改变性质时我们便知道它不再适用于儿童因为效力不够，无法保护儿童即便这样，儿童仍然需要多次注射疫苗
en:But smallpox eradication was hard;it was very, very hard.And polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher,and there&#39;s a few reasons for that.The first is that,when we started trying to eradicate polioabout 20 years ago,more than twice as many countries were infectedthan had been when we started off with smallpox.And there were more than 10 times as many peopleliving in these countries.So it was a massive effort.The second challenge we had was —in contrast to the smallpox vaccine,which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life —the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.It deteriorates so quickly in the tropicsthat we&#39;ve had to put this special vaccine monitoron every single vialso that it will change very quicklywhen it&#39;s exposed to too much heat,and we can tell that it&#39;s not a good vaccine to use on a child —it&#39;s not potent; it&#39;s not going to protect them.Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.
时间： 7:44
zh-cn:我们当时面临的第三个挑战很可能是最大的一个挑战与天花作战时，我们总能看清敌人几乎每个感染天花的人都会长出明显的疹子因此我们可以从疾病周边入手给疾病存在的周边区域打疫苗,将其断绝而脊髓灰质炎则全然不同绝大多数被病毒感染的人不会表现出任何迹象因此很多时候我们根本看不见敌人因此我们需要一种与应对天花非常不同的方式来根除脊髓灰质炎
en:But the third challenge we have —and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge —is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy —every single person almost who was infected with smallpoxhad this telltale rash.So you could get around the disease;you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.With polio it&#39;s almost completely different.The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virusshow absolutely no sign of the disease.So you can&#39;t see the enemy most of the time,and as a result,we&#39;ve needed a very different approach to eradicate poliothan what was done with smallpox.

zh-cn:我们不得不创造出历史上最大的社会运动之一投入人数超过一千万甚至接近两千万大多为志愿者他们过去二十年来一直努力贡献于现在被称为和平年代最大的国际协同运作这些人，这两千万人给五亿多的儿童注射疫苗每年如此在运作繁忙的时候注射数量增倍注射脊髓灰质炎疫苗很简单就是这样简单的两针但要普及五亿多人那可是难上加难这些疫苗注射者，这些志愿者们必须投身到一些环境最恶劣的城市贫民窟中必须在炎阳下跋涉到一些最遥远，最难以到达的地方有时他们也要躲避战火因为我们必须要运作即使在不稳定的停火和休战条约下也要给孩子注射疫苗在卷入冲突的地区也如此
en:We&#39;ve had to createone of the largest social movements in history.There&#39;s over 10 million people,probably 20 million people,largely volunteers,who have been working over the last 20 yearsin what has now been calledthe largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.These people, these 20 million people,vaccinate over 500 million childrenevery single year,multiple timesat the peak of our operation.Now giving the polio vaccine is simple.It&#39;s just two drops, like that.But reaching 500 million peopleis much, much tougher.And these vaccinators, these volunteers,they have got to dive headlonginto some of the toughest, densesturban slums in the world.They&#39;ve got to trek under sweltering sunsto some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world.And they also have to dodge bullets,because we have got to operateduring shaky cease-fires and trucesto try and vaccinate children,even in areas affected by conflict.

en:One reporterwho was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago —a place which has eradicated polio,not once, but twice, because they got reinfected.He was sitting outside of the road,watching one of these polio campaigns unfold,and a few months later he wrote:&quot;This is foreign aid at its most heroic.&quot;And these heroes, they come from every walk of life,all sorts of backgrounds.But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International.This is a groupwhose million-strong army of volunteershave been working to eradicate poliofor over 20 years.They&#39;re right at the center of the whole thing.

zh-cn:我们花了很多时间来发展基础建设为的是根除脊髓灰质炎超过十五年，比我们预计要长但一旦建成，效果是显著的几年之类那些开始进行脊髓灰质炎根除的国家迅速地消灭了现有的三种脊髓灰质炎病毒唯一例外是图表上的这四个国家而在这几个国家中，疾病都只存在于一小部分区域1999年我们试图根除的三种脊髓灰质炎病毒其中之一被完全地在全世界消灭证明了这是有效的方式今天有百分之九十九超过百分之九十九的儿童免于因这恐怖疾病而瘫痪而在二十多年前我们开始之际一千名儿童因它瘫痪这是每一天的数据去年一年的总数仅为一千
en:Now it took years to build up the infrastructurefor polio eradication —more than 15 years, much longer than it should have —but once it was built, the results were striking.Within a couple of years,every country that started polio eradicationrapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses,with the exception of four countries that you see here.And in each of those, it was only part of the country.And then, by 1999,one of the three polio virusesthat we were trying to eradicatehad been completely eradicated worldwide —proof of concept.And then today,there&#39;s been a 99 percent reduction —greater than 99 percent reduction —in the number of childrenwho are being paralyzed by this awful disease.When we started, over 20 years ago,1,000 children were being paralyzedevery single day by this virus.Last year, it was 1,000.

zh-cn:同时脊髓灰质炎根除项目也在帮助其他领域的工作比如控制流行感冒非典型肺炎它也试图通过其他方式来拯救儿童例如注射维他命A，注射麻疹药物散发蚊帐来抵御疟疾在这些运动中最振奋人心的是脊髓灰质炎根除项目的行动也促使我们国际社区来采取行动，帮助每一个儿童，每一个社区—帮助那些最脆弱的人群给予他们最基本的医疗服务无论地理，贫困文化甚至武装冲突状况如何
en:And at the same time,the polio eradication programhas been working to help with a lot of other areas.It&#39;s been working to help control pandemic flu,SARS for example.It&#39;s also tried to save children by doing other things —giving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots,giving bed nets against malaria evenduring some of these campaigns.But the most exciting thingthat the polio eradication program has been doinghas been to force us,the international community,to reach every single child, every single community,the most vulnerable people in the world,with the most basic of health services,irrespective of geography, poverty,culture and even conflict.

en:So things were looking very exciting,and then about five years ago,this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.The first problem we ran intowas that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus,we just couldn&#39;t seem to get the virus rooted out.And then to make the matters even worse,the virus started to spread out of these four places,especially northern India and northern Nigeria,into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe,causing horrific outbreaksin places that had not seen this disease for decades.And then,in one of the most important, tenaciousand toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world,we found that our vaccine was workinghalf as well as it should have.In conditions like this,the vaccine just couldn&#39;t get the grip it needed toin the guts of these childrenand protect them the way that it needed to.

en:Finishing polio is a smart thing to do,and it&#39;s the right thing to do.Now we&#39;re in tough times economically.But as David Cameron of the United Kingdomsaid about a month ago when he was talking about polio,&quot;There&#39;s never a wrong timeto do the right thing.&quot;Finishing polio eradicationis the right thing to do.And we are at a crossroads right nowin this great effort over the last 20 years.We have a new vaccine,we have new resolve,and we have new tactics.We have the chanceto write an entirely new polio-free chapterin human history.But if we blink now,we will lose foreverthe chance to eradicate an ancient disease.Here&#39;s a great idea to spread:End polio now.Help us tell the story.Help us build the momentumso that very soonevery child, every parenteverywherecan also take for granteda polio-free life forever.

zh-cn:布鲁斯·艾尔沃德：就是你刚才看到的那四个地方，我们从未中止过疾病的区域尼日尼亚北部，印度北部阿富汗南角和巴基斯坦交界处这些区域是最困难的关于其中三个国家，有一点很有趣印度现在情况很好，正如刚才的数据显示在阿富汗，我们大概多次了中断了脊髓灰质炎感染但它又不断复发因此最困难的是尼日尼亚北部和巴基斯坦它们是我们最难根除脊髓灰质炎的地区
en:BA: The four places where you saw, that we&#39;ve never stopped —northern Nigeria, northern India,the southern corner of Afghanistanand bordering areas of Pakistan —they&#39;re going to be the toughest.But the interesting thing is, of those three,India&#39;s looking real good, as you just saw in the data.And Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we thinkhas probably stopped polio repeatedly.It keeps getting reinfected.So the tough ones: going to get the top of Nigeria finishedand getting Pakistan finished.They&#39;re going to be the tough ones.

zh-cn:比尔·盖茨：资金方面呢？这场运动每年大概会耗费多少钱资金的筹集容易吗？接下来几年情况如何？
en:BG: Now what about the money?Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year.And is it easy to raise that money?And what&#39;s it going to be like the next couple of years?

zh-cn:布鲁斯·艾尔沃德：这一点比较有趣我们现在每年花费7.5到8亿美元这是帮助5亿儿童的花费这数目听起来很大，的确，是花了很多钱但用这些钱，我们能给5亿儿童提供多次的帮助每个儿童仅花费了20到 30美分这其实是很少的数目而现在我们资金不够我们差的还很远。因此我们在减少开支但每减少一次就意味着更多本不该被感染的地区受到感染，同时减缓我们的进度而这项伟大交易的成本又上涨了一些
en:BA: It&#39;s interesting.We spend right now about 750 millionto 800 million dollars a year.That&#39;s what it costs to reach 500 million children.It sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.But when you&#39;re reaching 500 million children multiple times —20, 30 cents to reach a child —that&#39;s not very much money.But right now we don&#39;t have enough of that.We have a big gap in that money. We&#39;re cutting corners,and every time we cut corners,more places get infected that shouldn&#39;t have, and it just slows us down.And that great buy costs us a little bit more.
