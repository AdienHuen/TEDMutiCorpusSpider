zh-cn:我敢打赌说在座的各位都比我聪明因为我在学校里成绩很差，无法完成我的学业但我很早就知道我喜欢经商和赚钱我喜欢这种创业经商的活动我生来就是一块做企业家的料我对创业一直以来非常热忱我之前从未说过这些，一直到今天除了3天前我对妻子说过这些话，你们是第一个听到这些话的人因为她问我：“你说的是什么意思？” 我就告诉她我认为我们丧失了一个大好机会去发掘一些具有企业家潜质的孩子来打造他们或者展示给他们看当一名企业家是多么酷的一件事情而并不是一件招人诋毁的坏事在很多地方这样的事情会发生
en:I would be willing to bet that I&#39;m the dumbest guy in the roombecause I couldn&#39;t get through school. I struggled with school.But what I knew at a very early agewas that I loved money and I loved businessand I loved this entrepreneurial thing,and I was raised to be an entrepreneur,and what I&#39;ve been really passionate about ever since —and I&#39;ve never spoken about this ever, until now —so this is the first time anyone&#39;s ever heard it, except my wife three days ago,because she said, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; and I told her —is that I think we miss an opportunityto find these kidswho have the entrepreneurial traits,and to groom them or show themthat being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing.It&#39;s not something that is a bad thing and is vilified,which is what happens in a lot of society.

zh-cn:当我们还是成长的孩童时，我们有着梦想我们有着热情和憧憬但不知何故，我们不再拥有这些东西取而代之的是我们被教导要努力学习多专注一点或者参加课外补习我的父母给我请了一个法语家教但我的法语还是很烂两年前，我被麻省理工学院企业家硕士课程被评为教得最好的讲师当时我要在来自全球各地的众多企业家面前演讲当我还在大学2年级，我就赢了所在城市的演讲大赛但没人曾说过,&quot;瞧，这个娃演讲得很不错虽然他注意力不集中，但他喜欢到处走动，激励身边的人.”没人说，“给他请一个演讲的教练吧.”但他们说，给我请一个家教来弥补我的不足之处
en:Kids, when we grow up, have dreams,and we have passions, and we have visions,and somehow we get those things crushed.We get told that we need to study harderor be more focused or get a tutor.My parents got me a tutor in French,and I still suck in French.Two years ago, I was the highest-rated lecturerat MIT&#39;s entrepreneurial master&#39;s program.And it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world.When I was in grade two, I won a city-wide speaking competition,but nobody had ever said,&quot;Hey, this kid&#39;s a good speaker.He can&#39;t focus, but he loves walking around and getting people energized.&quot;No one said, &quot;Get him a coach in speaking.&quot;They said, get me a tutor in what I suck at.

zh-cn:所以孩童们展现了这些潜质而我们要开始寻找这样的孩子我认为我们应该把孩子们培养成企业家而不是律师但很不幸，学校的教育把这个世界影响成：“嘿，当律师吧，做医生吧，”我们失去了一个机会，因为从未有人说，“嘿，你要做企业家.”企业家是这样的人—这个屋子里就有很多的企业家一旦有了想法和热情，或看到世界上的需求就会挺身而出，开始动手我们会想尽一切办法来实现自己的想法也会有能力吸引到和我们同样的人加入我们和我们一起实现梦想我想如果可以让孩子们在年幼的时候就拥有做创业家的理念恐怕现在世界上的很多问题都可以得到解决只要出现问题，就会有人提出解决之道作为一名孩童，没有事情是不可能的只是因为你笨到你都不知道该怎么办
en:So as kids show these traits —and we need to start looking for them —I think we should be raising kidsto be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.Unfortunately the school systemis grooming this worldto say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s be a lawyer or let&#39;s be a doctor,&quot;and we&#39;re missing that opportunity becauseno one ever says, &quot;Hey, be an entrepreneur.&quot;Entrepreneurs are people — because we have a lot of them in this room —who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the worldand we decide to stand up and do it.And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen.We have the ability to get those groups of people around usthat want to kind of build that dream with us,and I think if we could get kidsto embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial,we could change everything in the world that is a problem today.Every problem that&#39;s out there, somebody has the idea for.And as a young kid, nobody can say it can&#39;t happenbecause you&#39;re too dumb to realizethat you couldn&#39;t figure it out.

zh-cn:我认为作为家长和社会都有一个责任要教会我们的孩子如何学习知识而不是教给他们知识本身古老的谚语说得好“授人以鱼不如授人以渔”如果我们能教育孩子们成为企业家尤其是那些有企业家天赋的孩子们就像我们培养有科研天赋的孩子们成为科学家一样如果我们发现了那些有经商天赋的孩子们并教会他们成为企业家，世界会怎样？我们本来可以让这些孩子们到处经商并搞活市场而不是等着政府来拨款刺激经济
en:I think we have an obligation as parents and a societyto start teaching our kids to fishinstead of giving them the fish —the old parable: &quot;If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.&quot;If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial —the ones that show those traits to be —like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science,what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traitsand taught them to be entrepreneurs?We could actually have all these kids spreading businessesinstead of waiting for government handouts.

zh-cn:但我们所做的却是告诉孩子们这个那个都不能做不要打人，不要咬人，不要发誓现在的小孩子被告之将来要找一份很好的工作你知道，学校里的教育告诉他们要找到医生或者律师之类的职业或是会计师，牙医教书匠或是飞行员媒体则告诉他们成为模特或是歌手是一件很风光的事情或者成为像Sidney Crosby（加拿大职业冰球手）那样的运动明星我们的MBA教育没能教会孩子们如何成为企业家我之所以不去读MBA—除了我不够格这个事实之外因为我高中平均成绩只有61%而这61%的平均成绩在加拿大只能上Carlton这样的学校——另外的原因是我们的MBA课程并不教怎样成为企业家而是教学生去公司里如何工作
en:What we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn&#39;t do:Don&#39;t hit; don&#39;t bite; don&#39;t swear.Right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs,you know, and the school system teaches them to go after things likebeing a doctor and being a lawyerand being an accountant and a dentistand a teacher and a pilot.And the media says that it&#39;s really cool if we could go outand be a model or a singeror a sports hero like Luongo, Crosby.Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs.The reason that I avoided an MBA program —other than the fact that I couldn&#39;t get into anybecause I had a 61 percent average out of high schooland then 61 percent average atthe only school in Canada that accepted me, Carlton —but our MBA programs don&#39;t teach kids to be entrepreneurs.They teach them to go work in corporations.

zh-cn:请问是谁创立了这些公司呢？是那些数量很少的企业家甚至在大众书籍中，我能找到唯一的一本书你们应该把这本书放在必读条目上这本我能找到的唯一的将企业家描述成英雄的书的名字是《地球颠栗》其余的则带着有色眼镜看待企业家说我们不是什么好人我想起我的家人我的爷爷和外公都是企业家，我的父亲也是我的兄妹和我三个人都开了自己的公司我们都决定了开始做这样的事是因为只有做这个事情才最合适我们了我们并不适合做普通的工作，我们不会给别人打工因为我们太倔强了，以及与之类似的企业家的性格
en:So who&#39;s starting these companies? It&#39;s these random few people.Even in popular literature, the only book I&#39;ve ever found —and this should be on all of your reading lists —the only book I&#39;ve ever foundthat makes the entrepreneur into the hero is &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot;Everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneursand say that we&#39;re bad people.I look at even my family.Both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs. My dad was an entrepreneur.Both my brother and sister and I, all three of us own companies as well.And we all decided to start these thingsbecause it&#39;s really the only place we fit.We didn&#39;t fit in the normal work. We couldn&#39;t work for somebody elsebecause we&#39;re too stubborn and we have all these other traits.

zh-cn:但孩子们也可以成为企业家我是几个全球组织的重要分子名称是企业家组织和青年主席组织我刚从巴塞罗纳演讲归来参加了在那举办的青年主席组织大会我在那遇到的每个人只要他是企业家都有着在学校里成绩差的经历19种注意力缺乏症的征兆，我被诊断出18种所以在我面前的这个玩意让我心神不宁呀（笑声）这可能是为什么现在我的心有点乱——也有可能是我喝下的咖啡和糖的缘故——但作为一名企业家这确实很奇怪注意力缺乏症，双相障碍你知道双相障碍被戏称为CEO综合症吗？Ted Turner（CNN创办者）有此症状，Steve Jobs（苹果CEO）也有网景公司的三个创办人都有此症我还可以说出很多这样的例子孩子们——你可以在孩子们身上发现这些但我们却递给他们利他林（药物）并说，“不要成为企业家那样的人，适应另外一种环境并成为一名学生吧。”对不起，企业家不是学生我们走捷径。我们看清怎样玩这个游戏。我偷窃论文，考试作弊我在大学里雇人做我的会计学作业一连做了13次作业但你要知道企业家不做会计的事情，只是聘请会计而已所以我早就知道了这一点
en:But kids could be entrepreneurs as well.I&#39;m a big part of a couple organizations globallycalled the Entrepreneurs&#39; Organization and the Young Presidents&#39; Organization.I just came back from speaking in Barcelonaat the YPO global conference,and everyone that I met over therewho&#39;s an entrepreneurstruggled with school.I have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.So this thing right here is freaking me out.(Laughter)It&#39;s probably why I&#39;m a little bit panicked right now —other than all the caffeine that I&#39;ve had and the sugar —but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur.Attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder.Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease?Ted Turner&#39;s got it. Steve Jobs has it.All three of the founders of Netscape had it.I could go on and on.Kids — you can see these signs in kids.And what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re giving them Ritalin and saying,&quot;Don&#39;t be an entrepreneurial type.Fit into this other system and try to become a student.&quot;Sorry, entrepreneurs aren&#39;t students.We fast-track. We figure out the game.I stole essays. I cheated on exams.I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in universityfor 13 consecutive assignments.But as an entrepreneur you don&#39;t do accounting, you hire accountants.So I just figured that out earlier.

en:At least I can admit I cheated in university; most of you won&#39;t.I&#39;m also quoted — and I told the person who wrote the textbook —I&#39;m now quoted in that exact same university textbookin every Canadian university and college studies.In managerial accounting, I&#39;m chapter eight.I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting.And I told the author, after they did my interview, that I cheated in that same course.And she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway.

zh-cn:但是你可以在孩子们身上看到这些征兆企业家的定义是“组织和运营商业活动并衡量其风险”这并不代表你必须要读MBA也不代表你一定要从学校顺利毕业这只意味着，有少许几件事情在你心里能正确地判断就够了我们也听说过是选择人工培养还是自然成长是前者还是后者？究竟是哪一个？嗯，我觉得都不对。我觉得两者皆有可能。我从小就被训练成为企业家
en:But kids, you can see these signs in them.The definition of an entrepreneur is &quot;a person who organizes, operatesand assumes the risk of a business venture.&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean you have to go to an MBA program.It doesn&#39;t mean you have to get through school.It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut.And we&#39;ve heard those things about &quot;is it nurture or is it nature,&quot; right?Is it thing one or thing two? What is it?Well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s either. I think it can be both.I was groomed as an entrepreneur.

en:When I was growing up as a young kid, I had no choice,because I was taught at a very early, young age —when my dad realized I wasn&#39;t going to fit intoeverything else that was being taught to me in school —that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age.He groomed us, the three of us,to hate the thought of having a joband to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people.

zh-cn:我第一次做生意是在Winnipeg，那会我只有七岁我当时躺在我卧室的床上打着电话我打给了Winnipeg的所有的干洗店想知道干洗店愿意付多少钱买我的晾衣架我的母亲走进房间对我说，&quot;你去哪弄晾衣架来卖给干洗店呢？&quot;我说，“我们去地下室瞧瞧吧。”于是我们到了地下室。我把橱柜的门打开里面有近一千个我收集的晾衣架因为当我告诉母亲我出去是找别的小孩子玩的时候其实我是在挨家挨户地收集晾衣架并把它们存放在地下室等待出售因为这几个星期她不在我身边——你可以赚到钱，他们会付你一个衣架2分钱所以我想，有很多种晾衣架呀我应该去收集一些衣架。而且我知道她不想让我去做这些事情，但我还是去做了我也学到你其实可以和别人讨价还价有个人付我3美分，但我和他谈价谈到了3美分半我甚至在我七岁的时候就知道了我其实可以把1美分拆成更小的单位当累计很多这样的单位后，别人仍然可以付给你钱我七岁就明白了。我的1000个晾衣架每个3美分半。
en:My first little business venture: I was seven years old, I was in Winnipeg,and I was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords.And I was calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipegto find out how much would the dry cleanerspay me for coat hangers.And my mom came into the room and she said,&quot;Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners?&quot;And I said, &quot;Let&#39;s go and look in the basement.&quot;And we went down to the basement. And I opened up this cupboard.And there was about a thousand coat hangers that I&#39;d collected.Because, when I told her I was going out to play with the kids,I was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangersto put in the basement to sell.Because I saw her a few weeks before that —you could get paid. They used to pay you two cents per coat hanger.So I was just like, well there&#39;s all kinds of coat hangers.And so I&#39;ll just go get them.And I knew she wouldn&#39;t want me to go get them, so I just did it anyway.And I learned that you could actually negotiate with people.This one person offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half.I even knew at a seven-year-old agethat I could actually get a fractional percent of a cent,and people would pay that because it multiplied up.At seven years old I figured it out. I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers.

en:I sold license plate protectors door to door.My dad actually made me go find someonewho would sell me these things at wholesale.And at nine years old, I walked around in the city of Sudburyselling license plate protectors door to door to houses.And I remember this one customer so vividlybecause I also did some other stuff with these clients.I sold newspapers.And he wouldn&#39;t buy a newspaper from me ever.But I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license plate protector.And he&#39;s like, &quot;Well, we don&#39;t need one.&quot;And I said, &quot;But you&#39;ve got two cars ...&quot; — I&#39;m nine years old.I&#39;m like, &quot;But you have two cars and they don&#39;t have license plate protectors.&quot;And he said, &quot;I know.&quot;And I said, &quot;This car here&#39;s got one license plate that&#39;s all crumpled up.&quot;And he said, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s my wife&#39;s car.&quot; And I said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we just test oneon the front of your wife&#39;s car and see if it lasts longer.&quot;So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each.If I couldn&#39;t sell all four, I could at least get one.I learned that at a young age.

en:I did comic book arbitrage.When I was about 10 years old, I sold comic booksout of our cottage on Georgian Bay.And I would go biking up to the end of the beachand buy all the comics from the poor kids.And then I would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids.But it was obvious to me, right? Buy low, sell high.You&#39;ve got this demand over here that has money.Don&#39;t try to sell to the poor kids; they don&#39;t have cash. The rich people do. Go get some.So that&#39;s obvious, right.It&#39;s like a recession. So, there&#39;s a recession.There&#39;s still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the U.S. economy.Go get some of that. And I learned that at a young age.I also learned, don&#39;t reveal your source,because I got beat up after about four weeks of doing thisbecause one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics from,and he didn&#39;t like the fact that he was paying a lot more.

en:I built these little pincushions when I was 11 years old in Cubs,and we made these pin cushions for our moms for Mother&#39;s Day.And you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins —when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside.And you&#39;d make these chairs.And I had these little pillows that I would sew up.And you could stuff pins in them.Because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion.But what I realized was that you had to have options.So I actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown.And then when I went to the door, it wasn&#39;t, &quot;Do you want to buy one?&quot;It was, &quot;Which color would you like?&quot;Like I&#39;m 10 years old; you&#39;re not going to say no to me,especially if you have two options — you have the brown one or the clear one.So I learned that lesson at a young age.

So what, right?Yeah, but you know what? You stuff that down your shorts,when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free,everybody bought them.Supply, demand, big opportunity.I also branded it, so I sold them for five times the normal cost.It had our university logo on it.

zh-cn:你知道我们教育孩子，给他们买游戏但为什么我们不提供给他们游戏，如果他们是做企业家的料最好是那种培养企业家精神的游戏为什么你不去教他们不要乱花钱？我记得在Banff,艾伯塔,我被要求走在大街中央因为我在大街上扔了1分钱我父亲对我说，“去捡起来。”他说，“我这么辛苦赚钱，不想看到你浪费一分钱。”我至今还记得这件教训
en:You know we teach our kids and we buy them games,but why don&#39;t we get them games, if they&#39;re entrepreneurial kids,that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs?Why don&#39;t you teach them not to waste money?I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in Banff, Albertabecause I&#39;d thrown a penny out in the street,and my dad said, &quot;Go pick it up.&quot;He said, &quot;I work too damn hard for my money. I&#39;m not going to see you ever waste a penny.&quot;And I remember that lesson to this day.

zh-cn:零花钱会让孩子们养成坏习惯零花钱，从根本上，会让孩子们去想要为别人工作而企业家从不期望得到工资条零花钱从小就灌输给孩子们期望得到工资条的想法这是错的，在我看来，如果你想培养企业家拿我的孩子来说——我有两个，一个9岁，另一个7岁——我让他们在屋内，院子里到处走走找一些需要做的事情和东西然后告诉我需要做的是什么或者我找到他们并说，“这是我需要做的。”你知道我们会怎么做吗？我们会商谈他们四处寻找需要做什么但是我们会商谈应该付给他们多少钱他们不会有固定的收入，但有更多机会寻找更多的事情做他们学会了怎样讨价还价也学会了寻找机会的本领
en:Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.Allowances, by nature, are teaching kidsto think about a job.An entrepreneur doesn&#39;t expect a regular paycheck.Allowance is breeding kids at a young ageto expect a regular paycheck.That&#39;s wrong, for me, if you want to raise entrepreneurs.What I do with my kids now — I&#39;ve got two, nine and seven —is I teach them to walk around the house and the yard,looking for stuff that needs to get done.Come to me and tell me what it is.Or I&#39;ll come to them and say, &quot;Here&#39;s what I need done.&quot;And then you know what we do? We negotiate.They go around looking for what it is.But then we negotiate on what they&#39;re going to get paid.And then they don&#39;t have a regular check, but they have more opportunities to find more stuff,and they learn the skill of negotiating,and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well.

zh-cn:你应该灌输这样的观念。我的每个小孩有两个存钱罐他们赚的或别人给的钱，其中一半的钱一半存入他们的家庭账户另一半存入他们的玩具账户玩具账户的钱可以买任何他们想要的东西每6个月那一半在家庭账户的钱会被存入银行在银行存的所有的钱每年会交给他们的股票经纪人我的两个9岁和7岁的孩子都有一个股票经纪人我教育他们养成储蓄的好习惯令我很不解的是30多岁的人会说“也许我现在该开始缴纳RSP保险费了.&quot;见鬼，你已经晚了25年了你可以从小就培养他们养成这些习惯以免将来他们感到后悔
en:You breed that kind of stuff. Each of my kids has two piggy banks.Fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted,50 percent goes in their house account,50 percent goes in their toy account.Anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want.The 50 percent that goes in their house account, every six months, goes to the bank.They walk up with me. Every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker.Both my nine- and seven-year-olds have a stock broker already.But I&#39;m teaching them to force that savings habit.It drives me crazy that 30-year-olds are saying,&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll start contributing to my RSP now.&quot;Shit, you&#39;ve missed 25 years.You can teach those habits to young kidswhen they don&#39;t even feel the pain yet.

zh-cn:不要每天晚上临睡前都给孩子们讲故事也许一个星期内有四个晚上是讲故事给他们听另三个晚上则让他们讲给你听为什么你不和孩子们坐在一块，交给他们四样东西一件红衬衣，一条蓝领带，一个袋鼠玩具和一个笔记本电脑让他们用这些道具给你讲一个故事我的孩子们经常这样做这样可以让他们学会销售和创新也让他们可以独立地思考尽情地去用这种方法让孩子们开心地玩
en:Don&#39;t read them bedtime stories every night.Maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime storiesand three nights of the week have them tell stories.Why don&#39;t you sit down with kids and give them four items,a red shirt, a blue tie, a kangaroo and a laptop,and have them tell a story about those four things?My kids do that all the time.It teaches them to sell; it teaches them creativity;it teaches them to think on their feet.Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it.

zh-cn:让孩子们能站在众人面前演讲哪怕面对的是他们自己的朋友也可以让他们表演和演讲这些都是你要培养的企业家的特质让孩子们知道一个糟糕的顾客或员工是什么样子的把脾气坏的员工给他们指出来当你看到差劲的客户服务时，也给他们指出来并说，“你看，那个家伙是个不称职的员工”接着说,&quot;而这些员工都很尽职尽责。&quot;（笑声）如果你去餐馆用餐遇到很差的服务时让他们看看糟糕的服务是什么样子（笑声）我们身边有很多这样的例子但我们浪费了这些机会；反而聘请家教来为孩子们补习功课
en:Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk,even if it&#39;s just stand up in front of their friendsand do plays and have speeches.Those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing.Show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like.Show them the grumpy employees.When you see grumpy customer service, point that out to them.Say, &quot;By the way, that guy&#39;s a crappy employee.&quot;And say, &quot;These ones are good ones.&quot;(Laughter)If you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service,show them what bad customer service looks like.(Laughter)We have all these lessons in front of us,but we don&#39;t take those opportunities; we teach kids to go get a tutor.

zh-cn:想一想如果你现在把所有家里属于你孩子的垃圾所有你孩子这2年积攒的玩具拿出来并说，“为什么我们不把这些东西在Craigslist网和Kijiji网上出售呢？”这些东西他们其实可以拿去网上卖并且学会如何分辨电邮里开价的真假他们会进到你的帐户或你的子账户或者其他账户但要教他们怎样定价和估价以及教他们如何通过这种方式来赚钱然后一半的所得存入家庭账户另一半存入他们买玩具的账户我的孩子们喜爱做这些事情
en:Imagine if you actually tookall the kids&#39; junk that&#39;s in the house right now,all the toys that they&#39;ve outgrown two years agoand said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?&quot;And they can actually sell itand learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in.They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever.But teach them how to fix the price, guess the price,pull up the photos.Teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money.Then the money they get, 50 percent goes in their house account,50 percent goes in their toy account.My kids love this stuff.

zh-cn:有些企业家的特质是需要你去特别培养的：成就感，毅力，领导力，自省，独立和价值观这些特质都可以在孩子们身上找到，你可以帮助培养这些特质好好地寻找这些特质吧有两个特质我想引起你的注意我们不应该将其从他们身上扼杀不需要去治疗孩子的注意力缺乏症除非是严重到非治不可的地步（掌声）对狂躁症，压力过大和忧郁症也不需要药物治疗除非从医学角度上讲已经很严重了双相障碍被戏称为首席执行官综合症当Steve Jurvetson和Jim Clark还有Jim Barksdale有这个症状时他们做出了网景浏览器想像一下如果他们接受药物（利他林）治疗我们可能就不会有网景浏览器了，不是吗？可能艾尔·戈尔（美国前副总统）会成为因特网之父吧
en:Some of the entrepreneurial traits that you&#39;ve got to nurture in kids:attainment, tenacity, leadership, introspection, interdependence, values.All these traits you can find in young kids, and you can help nurture them.Look for that kind of stuff.There&#39;s two traits that I want you to also look out forthat we don&#39;t kind of get out of their system.Don&#39;t medicate kids for attention deficit disorderunless it is really, really freaking bad.(Applause)The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression,unless it is so clinically brutal, man.Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease.When Steve Jurvetson and Jim Clarkand Jim Barksdale have all got it,and they built Netscape —imagine if they were given Ritalin.We wouldn&#39;t have have that stuff, right?Al Gore really would have had to invented the Internet.

zh-cn:这些技能是我们应该在教室里教给孩子们的当然还有其他应该教的东西我不是说不要孩子们长大后当律师而是说将成为企业家这个理想摆放到和其他的理想同样的位置上去因为这样做会给我们带来很多的机会
en:These skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroomas well as everything else.I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t get kids to want to be lawyers.But how about getting entrepreneurshipto be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well?Because there&#39;s huge opportunities in that.
