zh-cn:我主要会写些关于建筑关于楼房的东西那些作品是基于某些假设。建筑师设计一座大楼 变成一个地点或很多建筑师设计很多座大楼变成一个城市先不去考虑这些复杂的力量掺杂在一起比如政治的 文化的 经济的， 它们塑造这些地点， 最终你都能去参观它们。你可以在它们周围走一走你可以闻一闻它们的气息。 你可以感受一下它们你可以体验一下它们的存在
en:I&#39;ve always written primarily about architecture,about buildings, and writing about architectureis based on certain assumptions.An architect designs a building, and it becomes a place,or many architects design many buildings, and it becomesa city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forcesof politics and culture and economics that shapesthese places, at the end of the day, you can goand you can visit them. You can walk around them.You can smell them. You can get a feel for them.You can experience their sense of place.

zh-cn:但近年来让我吃惊的是我越来越少出门走向世界越来越多地坐在我的电脑屏幕前特别是从大概2007年开始，那时我有了一台iPhone我不止整天坐在自己的电脑屏幕前面我还在一天结束的时候盯着我放在口袋里带着的这个小屏幕让我吃惊的是我和实体世界的关系多么迅速地发生了改变在很短的时间里，你知道，不管你是说过去在线的15年或是近期总是在线的四五年我们和周围的关系已经大为改变：我们的注意力一直受到分散我们既看着这些屏幕我们也看着身边的世界
en:But what was striking to me over the last several yearswas that less and less was I going out into the world,and more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.And especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone,I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day,but I was also getting up at the end of the dayand looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.And what was surprising to me was how quicklymy relationship to the physical world had changed.In this very short period of time, you know, whether youcall it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last,you know, four or five years of being online all the time,our relationship to our surroundings had changed in thatour attention is constantly divided. You know,we&#39;re both looking inside the screens and we&#39;re lookingout in the world around us.

zh-cn:让我更加吃惊 更不安的是屏幕里的世界似乎没有任何实体存在。如果你去找因特网的影像这就是你会找到的这张非常有名的欧普特影像就像银河系一样 无限延伸我们似乎不在上面我们永远都不能抓住它的整体它常让我想起阿波罗号所拍的地球照片那张蓝色大理石也似乎意味着我认为，我们不能真正的理解地球这个整体我们在无限之下显得非常渺小
en:And what was even more striking to me, and what I reallygot hung up on, was that the world inside the screenseemed to have no physical reality of its own.If you went and looked for images of the Internet,this was all that you found, this famous image by Opteof the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expansewhere we don&#39;t seem to be anywhere on it.We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.It&#39;s always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth,the blue marble picture, and it&#39;s similarly meant to suggest,I think, that we can&#39;t really understand it as a whole.We&#39;re always sort of small in the face of its expanse.

en:And then this happened.My Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does,and the cable guy came to fix it, and he started withthe dusty clump of cables behind the couch,and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard,and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire,and he said, &quot;There&#39;s your problem.A squirrel is chewing on your Internet.&quot; (Laughter)And this seemed astounding. The Internet isa transcendent idea. It&#39;s a set of protocols that has changedeverything from shopping to dating to revolutions.It was unequivocally not somethinga squirrel could chew on. (Laughter)But that in fact seemed to be the case.A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet. (Laughter)And then I got this image in my head of what would happenif you yanked the wire from the wall and if you startedto follow it. Where would it go?Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?Could I go there? Who would I meet?You know, was there something actually out there?

zh-cn:答案是人人都说没有这就是因特网 这个带着红色灯的黑盒子正如情景喜剧“IT狂人”里所显示的通常它会放在大笨钟的最高处因为那里是接收信号最好的地方但他们谈到过他们的同事可以在某个下午将它借去在办公室展示的时候使用因特网的资深用户愿意和它分开一会儿 她看着盒子说”这就是因特网吗 整个因特网 它重吗“他们回答 ”当然不重 因特网没有任何重量“
en:And the answer, by all accounts, was no.This was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it,as represented in the sitcom &quot;The IT Crowd.&quot;Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben,because that&#39;s where you get the best reception,but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow itfor the afternoon to use in an office presentation.The elders of the Internet were willing to part with itfor a short while, and she looks at it and she says,&quot;This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?&quot;They say, &quot;Of course not, the Internet doesn&#39;t weigh anything.&quot;

zh-cn:但事实上它是一个真实的世界确实有因特网的真实世界也就是我花费了过去两年时间到访的因特网的所在地我在大型的数据中心它们使用和所在城市一样多的能源我参观了类似这样的地方，比如纽约的哈德逊街60号它是一栋大楼名单中仅有的十几座中的其中一座那里是大量的网络连接彼此的地方——比别处的连接更多这样的连接确实是个有形的过程那关乎着网络的路由器 比如面书或谷歌或B.T.或康卡斯特或时代华纳 不管是什么通常连接着黄色的光纤电缆上至天花板一直到其他网络路由器那通常都是有形的且是密切联系的像哈德逊街60号的大楼和其他十几栋或其他大楼里面有超过十倍那么多的网络连接着它相较其他大楼而言这些大楼不是很少哈德逊街60号特别有趣是因为它是近六个重要网络连接的总部这些网络连接海底电缆网络穿过海底连接欧洲和美洲 连接我们所有人我特别想谈谈那些电缆
en:But, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there,and that&#39;s what I spent about two years visiting,these places of the Internet. I was in large data centersthat use as much power as the cities in which they sit,and I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York,which is one of the buildings in the world,one of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings,where more networks of the Internet connect to each otherthan anywhere else.And that connection is an unequivocally physical process.It&#39;s about the router of one network, a Facebook ora Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is,connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up intothe ceiling and down into the router of another network,and that&#39;s unequivocally physical, and it&#39;s surprisingly intimate.A building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others,has 10 times more networks connecting within itthan the next tier of buildings.There&#39;s a very short list of these places.And 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it&#39;s hometo about a half a dozen very important networks,which are the networks which serve the undersea cablesthat travel underneath the oceanthat connect Europe and America and connect all of us.And it&#39;s those cables in particular that I want to focus on.

zh-cn:如果因特网是个全球现象 如果我们活在地球村里 那是因为有电缆在海底 像这样的电缆从这个角度看 他们真的非常小你可以用手握着它们 他们就像花园软管一样但从另一个角度看 他们非常广阔就如你能想象的那般广阔它们在大海里延伸 它们有三或五或八千英里那么长如果说材料科学和计算机技术是无比复杂的 当中的基本物理过程却是惊人的简单 灯光从海的一边进去再从另一边出来 通常是从一座叫作坐落站的大楼出来常在临近海边不显眼的地方妥善保存起来在海床设有增强器它们看起来像蓝鳍吞拿 每50英里它们会增强信号 由于传播速度无比迅速 基本单位是每秒10千兆比特光波 也许是你连接速度的一千倍或能承载1万个视频流但不止那样 你不会只把一个光波放在一条光纤里 你也许会在一根光纤里放50或60或70个不同波长或颜色的光波然后你也许会在一个电缆里放8个光纤 四个又分散到不同方向它们很细小 就像头发那么粗
en:If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we livein a global village, it&#39;s because there are cables underneaththe ocean, cables like this.And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.You can you hold them in your hand. They&#39;re like a garden hose.But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive,as expansive as you can imagine.They stretch across the ocean. They&#39;re three or fiveor eight thousand miles in length, andif the material science and the computational technologyis incredibly complicated, the basic physical processis shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the oceanand comes out on the other, and it usually comesfrom a building called a landing station that&#39;s oftentucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood,and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floorthat look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 milesthey amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmissionis incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-secondwavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your ownconnection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams,but not only that, but you&#39;ll put not just one wavelength of lightthrough one of the fibers, but you&#39;ll put maybe50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of lightthrough a single fiber, and then you&#39;ll have maybeeight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.And they&#39;re tiny. They&#39;re the thickness of a hair.

zh-cn:它们可以连接到大陆的某个地方它们会在沙井里面连接起来 像这样。 实际上这是5千英里电缆接入的地方这里是哈利法克斯 电缆从这里延伸到爱尔兰景观在变化 三年前当我开始思考这个问题的时候 有一条电缆连接到非洲的西岸也就是Steve Song这个地图上的小黑线现在已经有六条电缆 还会有更多 三条连接到东岸因为一旦一个国家连接了一条电缆他们会意识到这是不足够的 如果他们想在电缆周围建立工业 他们需要知道他们的连接不是脆弱的而是永久的 因为如果一个电缆断了你得派船到海中央扔个抓钩 钩起一头电缆 再勾起另一头然后把两端焊接在一起 再把它丢到海里这真是个很折腾的物理过程
en:And then they connect to the continent somewhere.They connect in a manhole like this. Literally,this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.And the landscape is changing. Three years ago,when I started thinking about this, there was one cabledown the Western coast of Africa, representedin this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable,they realize that it&#39;s not enough. If they&#39;re going to buildan industry around it, they need to know that their connectionisn&#39;t tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks,you have to send a ship out into the water, throwa grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end,and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.It&#39;s an intensely, intensely physical process.

zh-cn:这是我的朋友Simon Cooper 他最近在Tata通讯公司工作 Tata通讯部大型印度工业企业集团我和他没有见过面 我们只是视频通话 这常让我觉得他是因特网里面的人 (笑声)他是英国人 海底电缆工业是由英国人主导的 他们大多看起来像42岁(笑声) 因为他们都在同一时间入行从20年前的兴盛时期开始的Tata是以通讯业起家的一开始他们买了两条电缆 一条横跨大西洋一条横跨太平洋并继续完善它们直到它们连接了整个世界这意味着他们会把你的比特信息传送到东方或西方他们有真的是有一束环绕地球的光如果有电缆在太平洋中断开了 它会把光发送到另一个方向 这么做以后他们就开始寻找下一个连线的地方他们会寻找没有连线的地方 那意味着北方或者南方 首先要连去非洲让我惊奇的是Simon有非凡的地理想象力他想象中的世界无限延伸
en:So this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recentlyworked for Tata Communications, the communications wingof Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.And I&#39;ve never met him. We&#39;ve only communicatedvia this telepresence system, which always makes methink of him as the man inside the Internet. (Laughter)And he is English. The undersea cable industryis dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.(Laughter) Because they all started at the same timewith the boom about 20 years ago.And Tata had gotten its start as a communications businesswhen they bought two cables, one across the Atlanticand one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add piecesonto them, until they had built a belt around the world,which means they will send your bits to the East or the West.They have — this is literally a beam of light around the world,and if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it&#39;ll send it aroundthe other direction. And then having done that,they started to look for places to wire next.They looked for the unwired places, and that&#39;s meantNorth and South, primarily these cables to Africa.But what amazes me is Simon&#39;s incredible geographic imagination.He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.

en:And I was particularly interested because I wanted to seeone of these cables being built. See, you know, all the timeonline we experience these fleeting moments of connection,these sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook postor an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.It seemed like there was a moment when the continentwas being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.And Simon was working on a new cable,WACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretchedfrom Lisbon down the west coast of Africa,to Cote d&#39;Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.And he said there was coming soon, dependingon the weather, but he&#39;d let me know when,and so with about four days notice, he said to goto this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9,this guy will walk out of the water. (Laughter)And he&#39;ll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line,called a messenger line, and that was the first linkbetween sea and land, this link that would then beleveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from thisspecialized cable landing ship, and it was floatedon these buoys until it was in the right place.Then you can see the English engineers looking on.And then, once it was in the right place, he got backin the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off,and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cabledropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way outto the ship, and when he got there,they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie,and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore,and then he lit a cigarette.

en:And then once that cable was on shore,they began to prepare to connect it to the other side,for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.And first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they startsort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a —sort of working like chefs, and then finally they&#39;re workinglike jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line upwith the cable that had come down,and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw,you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.And what surprised me as well was that as much as thisis based on the most sophisticated technology, as muchas this is an incredibly new thing, the physical processitself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.You see the local laborers. You see the English engineergiving directions in the background. And more importantly,the places are the same. These cables still connectthese classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa,Mumbai, Singapore, New York.
