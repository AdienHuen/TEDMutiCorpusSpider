zh-cn:幸会，诸位。有一个好消息我非常清楚我负有将各位带离现场的责任因为我是你们和酒巴之间唯一的障碍了（笑声）好在是我并没有提前准备好一个长篇演讲，但我有一大盒幻灯片。我有一些能够描述我的生活，以及我如何谋生的图片。我的经验告诉我人们能够在忘记文字以后很久，还记得图片上的内容。所以我希望你们会记住其中的一些图片我将要和你们分享的，只需要几分钟时间
en:It&#39;s a great honor to be here with you.The good news isI&#39;m very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of herebecause I&#39;m the only thing standing between you and the bar.(Laughter)And the good news is I don&#39;t have a prepared speech,but I have a box of slides.I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living.I&#39;ve learned through experiencethat people remember pictures long after they&#39;ve forgotten words,and so I hope you&#39;ll remember some of the picturesI&#39;m going to share with you for just a few minutes.

zh-cn:故事从这里开始……那时候我还是宾州匹兹堡一所高中的学生，生活在一个很乱的，每个人都放弃了希望的街区。在一个星期三的下午我走在学校的过道中，一边想着自己的心事，当时这位艺术家在讲课，他做了一个巨大的老式瓷器。我无意中朝艺术教室的大门内看了一眼如果你曾经见过制陶器是怎么作出来的，那简直就是魔法我一生当中从未见过那样的东西。于是我就走进了艺术教室，说：“这是什么？”他说：“瓷器……你是谁？”我说：“我是比尔·斯特里克兰，我想你教教我弄这个。”他说：“好的，让你的主管教师签一个单子，说明你可以来这里学，我就教你。”就这样，我在中学的最后两年，我取消了所有的课程，（笑声）但我很安心，我给那些我取消了课程的老师送去我做的瓷器（笑）他们就给了我合格。我就是这样完成了中学的学业。
en:The whole story really startswith me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead.And on a Wednesday afternoon,I was walking down the corridor of my high schoolkind of minding my own business. And there was this artist teaching,who made a great big old ceramic vessel,and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room —and if you&#39;ve ever seen clay done, it&#39;s magic —and I&#39;d never seen anything like that before in my life.So, I walked in the art room and I said, &quot;What is that?&quot;And he said, &quot;Ceramics. And who are you?&quot;And I said, &quot;I&#39;m Bill Strickland. I want you to teach me that.&quot;And he said, &quot;Well, get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paperthat says you can come here, and I&#39;ll teach it to you.&quot;And so for the remaining two years of my high school,I cut all my classes.(Laughter)But I had the presence of mindto give the teachers&#39; classes that I cut the pottery that I made,(Laughter)and they gave me passing grades.And that&#39;s how I got out of high school.

zh-cn:罗斯先生说：“你这个鬼灵精，为了让我的良心不受谴责，我要离开这所学校并把你带走。”然后他就开车带我到了匹兹堡大学我在那填了一份入学申请，并获准试读我现在是这所大学的理事会成员在我的就职典礼上，我说，“我在附近的街区长大以试读生的身份进入了这所大学不要放弃那些穷孩子，因为你永远不知道他们的生命里会发生什么样的事情。”
en:And Mr. Ross said,&quot;You&#39;re too smart to die and I don&#39;t want it on my conscience,so I&#39;m leaving this school and I&#39;m taking you with me.&quot;And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburghwhere I filled out a college application and got in on probation.Well, I&#39;m now a trustee of the university,and at my installation ceremony I said,&quot;I&#39;m the guy who came from the neighborhoodwho got into the place on probation.Don&#39;t give up on the poor kids, because you never knowwhat&#39;s going to happen to those children in life.&quot;

zh-cn:我要用几分钟时间来展示给诸位的是我在匹兹堡犯罪率最高的街区里建立的一所设施彼得维尔培训中心，这是一所为失业者、单亲妈妈和福利妈妈设立的专科学校。还记得匹兹堡以前生产钢铁吗？现在这里已经不再生产钢铁了过去以炼钢为生的人们面临非常困难的情况。我改造他们，给他们新的生活。
en:What I&#39;m going to show you for a couple of minutesis a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburghwith the highest crime rate.One is called Bidwell Training Center; it is a vocational schoolfor ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers.You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh?Well, we don&#39;t make any steel anymore,and the people who used to make the steelare having a very tough time of it.And I rebuild them and give them new life.

zh-cn:曼彻斯特手工艺行会就是以我们的街区命名的。在骚乱中我曾经被圣公会的主教收留。他捐出了一座废弃的住宅楼，在那里，我建立了曼彻斯特手工艺行会，我很快就知道，只要有圣公会教徒的地方，附近就有钱！（笑声）主教视我如己出，去年我在他的追悼会上致辞，这一生我都会感激他。我找来建筑大师弗兰克·劳埃德·赖特的一位学生，让他替我建一座世界级的（培训）中心，就在匹兹堡最糟糕的地带。我的中心简直就是匹兹堡机场的比例模型。当你们来到匹兹堡……随时欢迎诸位……你们就飞进了我的建筑的放大版本。这就是我的建筑。建在一个贫困潦倒的粗鲁的街区。
en:Manchester Craftsmen&#39;s Guild is named after my neighborhood.I was adoptedby the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots,and he donated a row house. And in that row houseI started Manchester Craftsmen&#39;s Guild,and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians,there&#39;s money in very close proximity.(Laughter)And the Bishop adopted me as his kid.And last year I spoke at his memorial serviceand wished him well in this life.I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the architect,and I asked him to build me a world class centerin the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh.And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport.And when you come to Pittsburgh — and you&#39;re all invited —you&#39;ll be flying into the blown-up version of my building.That&#39;s the building.Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead.

zh-cn:我认为，如果想介入那些已经被认为没有希望的人的生活，你自己就更应该看上去象是解决问题的办法，而不是问题本身。你们看，院子里有一个喷泉园子里做一个喷泉是我的主意。我掌握着支票本，就买了一个放在那。（笑声）现在我在很多类似TED的会议上演讲，他们让我加入了卡内基博物馆的董事会在博物馆院子的一个接待处，我看到那也有一个喷泉因为他们认为应该让每个去到博物馆的人都看到一个喷泉。嗯，我认为应该让福利妈妈、不幸的孩子和失业者的生活里，都有一个“喷泉”。所以春季你在我的中心第一眼看到的，就是迎接你的水花——水是生命之源。它在你向人们开口之前，就明确了你对他们的态度和期望。于是我从这座喷泉开始建立了这座建筑。
en:My view is that if you want to involve yourselfin the life of people who have been given up on,you have to look like the solution and not the problem.As you can see, it has a fountain in the courtyard.And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted oneand I had the checkbook, so I bought one and put it there.(Laughter)And now that I&#39;m giving speeches at conferences like TED,I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum.At a reception in their courtyard, I noticed that they had a fountainbecause they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain.Well, I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kidsand ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life.And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtimeis water that greets you — water is life and water of human possibility —and it sets an attitude and expectationabout how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech.So, from that fountain I built this building.

zh-cn:正如你们所看到的，它具备世界级的艺术水准，而且完全符合我的口味因为我筹集了所有的资金。（笑声）我对我的儿子说：“如果你筹来了钱我们就把你的口味写在墙上。”实际上我们有织锦、瓷器还有书法在你目光所到之处，都有些美丽的东西和你相对。用心良苦，颇费周章啊。我认为，只有这样的世界，才能够拯救贫苦大众的灵魂。
en:As you can see, it has world class art, and it&#39;s all my tastebecause I raised all the money.(Laughter)I said to my boy, &quot;When you raise the money,we&#39;ll put your taste on the wall.&quot;That we have quilts and clay and calligraphyand everywhere your eye turns,there&#39;s something beautiful looking back at you,that&#39;s deliberate.That&#39;s intentional.In my view, it is this kind of worldthat can redeem the soul of poor people.

zh-cn:我们还建了一个会议室。我从日本的京都重金请来一位家具匠人，让他为我们的建筑制作了60件家具。因为我们，他从此开创了自己的事业。他现在为富人定制家具，赚了很多很多的钱。他的定制家具中有60件是我为我的学校订作的。因为我觉得福利母亲、失业者和单身妈妈都愿意去一所有些手工家具每天欢迎他们的学校因为这是一种早在你向他们开口之前就已经表明的你如何对待他们的腔调和态度。
en:We also created a boardroom,and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto, Japan,and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building.We have since spun him off into his own business.He&#39;s making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people.And I got 60 pieces out of it for my schoolbecause I felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workersand single parents deserved to come to a schoolwhere there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day.Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about peoplelong before you give them the speech.

zh-cn:我们甚至在走廊里布置了花，这些花不是塑料的他们可是货真价实，每天都摆在我们的楼里现在，我已经做了很多场演讲了有一帮高中校长来看我他们说，“斯特里克兰先生，你的故事真是太精彩了，你的学校也很棒。特别是那些花,它们尤其让我们感动。我们很好奇，那些花是怎么摆到那里的呢？”我说：“我开上车，来到花房，把这些花买下来，然后他们带回来并放到那里。”你不需要一个任务小组或者一个研究小组来为你的孩子买花。你需要知道的是，孩子和成人在他们的生命中都配得欣赏鲜花。买花的费用无阻挂齿，但是它所表达的东西是很巨大的。在我的学校了，充满了阳光和鲜花，我们坚信希望和人类的潜能。当时刚好在圣诞期间。
en:We even have flowers in the hallway, and they&#39;re not plastic.Those are real and they&#39;re in my building every day.And now that I&#39;ve given lots of speeches,we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me,and they said, &quot;Mr. Strickland,what an extraordinary story and what a great school.And we were particularly touched by the flowersand we were curious as to how the flowers got there.&quot;I said, &quot;Well, I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouseand I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there.&quot;You don&#39;t need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids.What you need to know is that the childrenand the adults deserve flowers in their life.The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge.And so in my building, which is full of sunlight and full of flowers,we believe in hope and human possibilities.That happens to be at Christmas time.

zh-cn:接下来你们将看到的是一个价值一百万美元的厨房它由亨氏（Heinz）企业为我们提供的，你们听说过这间公司吗？他们在番茄酱领域做得不错。我恰好挺熟悉这家公司，因为，参议员约翰亨氏先生后来他不幸死于飞机失事-听说了我要建这么一座新楼的愿望，因为我正拿着一个纸盒放在垃圾袋里走遍匹兹堡为此筹款呢。于是他就让我去他的办公室—那感觉就像我要去看《绿野仙踪》一样（笑声）约翰亨氏（John Heinz）有6个亿美元，我当时却只有60美分。他说：“我们听说过你，以及你为儿童和失业工人做的工作，我们很想资助你修建这个新楼的愿望。如果能在你的课程里增加一个烹饪课程的话，那你就给我们帮了大忙了。”因为在当时，我们只是要做工匠培训方面的。他说：“那样的话我们就实现亨氏企业反歧视行动的目标。”我说，“参议员先生，让我涉足不熟悉的领域，这使我感觉有些勉为其难，但是我向你保证，如果你资助我的学校，一两年的时间我就会把它建好，然后我就会考虑你想做的那个项目的。”亨参议员静静的坐在那儿，说：说：“嗯，如果我说我要给你一百万美元，你的反应会怎样呢？”我说: “参议院先生，看来我们要进军烹饪培训业了。”(笑声)然后约翰亨氏就真的给了我一百万。而最重要的是，他还把他的公司研究部部长派给了我。我们借用了一点儿美国烹饪学校（Culinary Institute of America）的课程,而那个学校就好像是烹饪界的哈佛。于是，我们为福利妈妈们设计了一个美食烹饪课程，就在市中心的这个价值百万美元的厨房里。我们从没有回过头。
en:And so the next thing you&#39;ll see is a million dollar kitchenthat was built by the Heinz company — you&#39;ve heard of them?They did all right in the ketchup business.And I happen to know that company pretty wellbecause John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator —who was tragically killed in a plane accident —he had heard about my desire to build a new building,because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bagand I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site.And he called me into his office —which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz(Laughter) —and John Heinz had 600 million dollars, and at the time I had about 60 cents.And he said, &quot;But we&#39;ve heard about you.We&#39;ve heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers,and we&#39;re inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building.And you could do us a great serviceif you would add a culinary program to your program.&quot;Because back then, we were building a trades program.He said, &quot;That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goalsfor the Heinz company.&quot;I said, &quot;Senator, I&#39;m reluctant to go into a fieldthat I don&#39;t know much about, but I promise youthat if you&#39;ll support my school, I&#39;ll get it builtand in a couple of years, I&#39;ll come backand weigh out that program that you desire.&quot;And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said,&quot;Well, what would your reaction beif I said I&#39;d give you a million dollars?&quot;I said, &quot;Senator, it appears that we&#39;re going into the food training business.&quot;(Laughter)And John Heinz did give me a million bucks.And most importantly,he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company.And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America,which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools,and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothersin this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city.And we&#39;ve never looked back.

zh-cn:我想向你们展示一些食物它们是由这些福利妈妈们在这个百万美元的厨房里烹制的。这是我们的餐厅。这是松饼日。 为什么这样呢？因为学生们做了这些松饼而学校的学生每天都在吃这些食物但是我的理念是，我要剔除食物中耻辱的标记。美食并非富人独享美食属于这个星球上的每一个人。每个人都应该享用，没有理由可以把任何人排除在外。所以，在我的学校里，我们资助了一项美味午餐计划，这些计划是为住在内城的中部地区的福利妈妈们准备的，因为我们发现，这有益于她们的胃。不过更有益于他们的头脑。因为我想让他们明白，在这个被我称之为中心的地方，他们生命的每一天都是有价值的。
en:I would like to show you now some of the foodthat these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen.That happens to be our cafeteria line.That&#39;s puff pastry day. Why?Because the students made puff pastryand that&#39;s what the school ate every day.But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food.That good food&#39;s not for rich people —good food&#39;s for everybody on the planet,and there&#39;s no excuse why we all can&#39;t be eating it.So at my school, we subsidize a gourmet lunch programfor welfare mothers in the middle of the inner citybecause we&#39;ve discovered that it&#39;s good for their stomachs,but it&#39;s better for their heads.Because I wanted to let them know every day of their lifethat they have value at this place I call my center.

zh-cn:我们这儿有黑人学生，也有白人学生，他们都坐在一起我们发现，种族问题是可以解决的，办法是创造一个世界级的环境。因为人们愿意展现世界级的行为如果你能这样对对他们。这张是照片是福利妈妈们在培训六个月后做出的食物。没有刻意、没有阶级、没有贵贱、没有历史。我们发现，穷人唯一的问题就在于他们没有一分钱，而这个问题是可以解决的。这完全取决于你们是怎样看待人们的这常常决定了他们的行为。这张照片是由一个参加培训七个月的学生做的食物。她既聪明又年轻。她的老师就是我们的糕点师。我已经吃了7个这样的食物篮子了，味道很不错。笑声。它们没有卡路里。这是我们的餐厅。看上去就象一个普通美国小镇中的学校餐厅一样。我认为学生们应该得到这样的尊重，尤其是对那些曾被人们放弃过的孩子们。
en:We have students who sit together, black kids and white kids,and what we&#39;ve discovered is you can solve the race problemby creating a world class environment,because people will have a tendency to show you world class behaviorif you treat them in that way.These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doingafter six months in the training program.No sophistication, no class, no dignity, no history.What we&#39;ve discovered is the only thing wrong with poor peopleis they don&#39;t have any money, which happens to be a curable condition.It&#39;s all in the way that you think about peoplethat often determines their behavior.That was done by a student after seven months in the program,done by a very brilliant young womanwho was taught by our pastry chef.I&#39;ve actually eaten seven of those baskets and they&#39;re very good.(Laughter)They have no calories.That&#39;s our dining room.It looks like your average high school cafeteriain your average town in America.But this is my view of how students ought to be treated,particularly once they have been pushed aside.

zh-cn:我们为制药业培训制药方面的技术人员。我们为医疗行业提供医疗技术人员。我们还为一些公司培训化工技术人员，比如拜尔，卡尔冈炭素, 飞世尔科技以及埃克森石油。我向你们保证，如果你们来到我的匹兹堡中心，当然你们都受到我们的邀请你们会看到，福利妈妈们在使用对数计算机作化学分析。他们才入学10个月。没有任何理由证明穷人就不能学习世界级的技术。我们发现，你必须给他们鲜花、阳光、食物、期望、赫比（Herbie）的音乐这样每次你都能够治愈精神上的癌症了。
en:We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry,we train medical technicians for the medical industry,and we train chemical technicians for companieslike Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon.And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh —and you&#39;re all invited —you&#39;ll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistrywith logarithmic calculators10 months from enrolling in the program.There is absolutely no reason why poor peoplecan&#39;t learn world class technology.What we&#39;ve discovered is you have to give them flowersand sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie&#39;s music,and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time.

zh-cn:我们为旅游业培训旅游专员。我甚至还教人读书识字。穿红条衫的那个孩子两年前参加了培训他现在已经成了课程的教师。还有一些孩子都有高中毕业证书，但自己却不认识证书上的字。你们肯定会问自己都21世纪了，这种连毕业证上的字都不会念的孩子我们就让他们毕业了，怎么可能还有这种事情。其实原因是，教育系统从政府拿钱是以毕业人数为基准而不是认字的人数。这样的孩子们只要智力正常，20周内就可以在我的学校中达到高中生的水平。没什么大不了的。那个是我们的图书馆，有更多的手工家具，这个是我在1968年开班的艺术课程。
en:We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry.We even teach people how to read.The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago —he&#39;s now an instructor.And I have children with high school diplomas that they can&#39;t read.And so you must ask yourself the question:how is it possible in the 21st centurythat we graduate children from schoolswho can&#39;t read the diplomas that they have in their hands?The reason is that the system gets reimbursedfor the kids they spit out the other end, not the children who read.I can take these children and in 20 weeks,demonstrated aptitude; I can get them high school equivalent.No big deal.That&#39;s our library with more handcrafted furniture.And this is the arts program I started in 1968.

zh-cn:请记住，我是一个生长于60年代的黑人，陶器制造挽救了我的生命。当我准备把我的成长模式复制到其他住在我那个地方的小孩身上时我的理论就是，如果你给他们鲜花、食物、阳光和激情，你就能让他们重新回到正常的生活中去。有400个曾就读匹兹堡公立学校的孩子每天都来我这里接受艺术教育。这些孩子都快被公立学校退学了。去年我让这些孩子中的88%的人进入了大学，这个比例平均高于80%已经有15年了。我们做出一个惊人的发现:问题不在孩子们身上没有爱、阳光、食物、热情、和赫比的音乐不能治愈的孩子。凭这个发现，我赢得了一个又大又旧的匾额—-年度杰出教育人物。我打败了所有的博士们因为我认为，如果你把孩子像人一样对待的话，他们的举动就更有可能像个正常人。我们为什么不能在每个学校、每个城市、每个小镇制定这样的措施呢？我真的很难理解。
en:Remember I&#39;m the black kid from the &#39;60s who got his life saved with ceramics.Well, I went out and decided to reproduce my experiencewith other kids in the neighborhood,the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them foodand you give them sunshine and enthusiasm,you can bring them right back to life.I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school systemthat come to me every day of the week for arts education.And these are children who are flunking out of public school.And last year I put 88 percent of those kids in collegeand I&#39;ve averaged over 80 percent for 15 years.We&#39;ve made a fascinating discovery:there&#39;s nothing wrong with the kidsthat affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasmand Herbie&#39;s music can&#39;t cure.For that I won a big old plaque — Man of the Year in Education.I beat out all the Ph.D.&#39;sbecause I figured that if you treat children like human beings,it increases the likelihood they&#39;re going to behave that way.And why we can&#39;t institute that policyin every school and in every city and every townremains a mystery to me.

zh-cn:让我来告诉你这些人是怎么做的。我们有陶瓷制造课、摄影课、电脑制图课，而这些孩子们没有艺术细胞、没有才华、没有想象力，我们又请来了很多世界级的艺术家Gordon Parks和Chester Higgins都来过我们这儿我们发现孩子们可以变成和教他们的人一样的人。实际上，我从梵蒂冈请来了一个镶嵌艺术家，她是一位非洲裔美国人，学习古代梵蒂冈镶嵌艺术技巧。让我来给你们看看他们的作品这些孩子曾被世界抛弃被公立学校开除而这幅画证明了他们的能力只要有爱、阳光、食物、美好的音乐和自信。
en:Let me show you what these people do.We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging.And these are all kids with no artistic ability, no talent,no imagination. And we bring in the world&#39;s greatest artists —Gordon Parks has been there, Chester Higgins has been there —and what we&#39;ve learnedis that the children will become like the people who teach them.In fact, I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican,an African-American womanwho had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques,and let me show you what they did with the work.These were children who the whole world had given up on,who were flunking out of public school,and that&#39;s what they&#39;re capable of doingwith affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence.

zh-cn:我们教授摄影这是一些学生的作品拍摄这张照片的男孩凭借这幅照片展示出的力量拿到了4年的奖学金这是我们的画廊我们有一个世界级的画廊因为我们相信穷孩子需要一个世界级的画廊。所以我设计了它。我们在艺术展开幕式准备了熏三文鱼。我们有正式的印刷请柬。我甚至想出一个方法来让他们家长参加开幕式。15年前，我就是花钱也请不来一个父母。所以我就雇了个人，他从上帝的事业中跳槽过来。他把人们从酒吧里拉出来让他们得到上帝的救赎。我说：“比尔，我想聘用你，你得先把上帝的事儿放一放，不过得保持这股激情。（笑声）我没法让这些父母来学校。“他说：“我会让他们来学校的。”然后他就开上面包车，来到琼斯太太家，问道,&quot;琼斯女士，我知道你想去参加你孩子的艺术展开幕式，但是你可能没车过去。所以我来载你去。”他先叫来了10个家长，然后又来了20个家长。在我们的上一个展览上，来了200个家长。一个家长我们都没有去接。因为现在，你要是不来曼彻斯特工匠行会办的展览支持你的小孩的话，你就不会被社会接受，因为大家认为你是糟糕的家长。而白人家长和黑人家长在这点上都是一样的。母亲们会去参加自己孩子的庆祝活动任何时间、任何地点都是如此我想让你们看看这个画廊，因为不可能比它作得更好了。到这些孩子从我这里毕业的时候他们在申请大学前他们的简历上就有了四次展览的经历了。
en:We teach photography.And these are examples of some of the kids&#39; work.That boy won a four-year scholarshipon the strength of that photograph.This is our gallery.We have a world class gallerybecause we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery,so I designed this thing.We have smoked salmon at the art openings,we have a formal printed invitation,and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come.I couldn&#39;t buy a parent 15 years agoso I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time.He was dragging guys out of barsand saving those lives for the Lord.And I said, &quot;Bill, I want to hire you, man.You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit,but keep the enthusiasm.(Laughter) (Applause)I can&#39;t get these parents to come to the school.&quot;He said, &quot;I&#39;ll get them to come to the school.&quot;So, he jumped in the van, he went to Miss Jones&#39; house and said,&quot;Miss Jones, I knew you wanted to come to your kid&#39;s art openingbut you probably didn&#39;t have a ride.So, I came to give you a ride.&quot;And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents.At the last show that we did, 200 parents showed upand we didn&#39;t pick up one parent.Because now it&#39;s become socially not acceptable not to show upto support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen&#39;s Guildbecause people think you&#39;re bad parents.And there is no statistical differencebetween the white parents and the black parents.Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated,every time, every town, every city.I wanted you to see this gallery because it&#39;s as good as it gets.And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school,they&#39;ve got four shows on their resumebefore they apply to college because it&#39;s all up here.

zh-cn:我还有一些幻灯片。故事开始越来越有趣了。所以我想让你们再多听我几分钟，然后你就会明白为什么他在那儿，我在这儿。1986年我正在修建这个中心的时候，我就想在它的最北边修一个音乐厅。然后一个叫Dizzy Gillespie的人就来这儿表演了，因为他认识坐在那边的人—Marty Ashby。一个星期三的下午，Dizzy和我在台上试音，我说，“Dizzy， 为什么你要来一个黑人办的中心来表演呢？这儿是个工业园区，犯罪率又高，在音乐界一点名气也没有。”他说：“因为我听说你建了这个中心，但我不相信你把这个做成了，所以我想亲自来看看。现在我相信了，而且我要送你一件礼物。”我说：“你就是我的礼物。”他说：“不，先生，你才是那件礼物。我允许你为我的现场录音我要把我的音乐版权给你如果你准备通过这些录音营利的话，你必须签一个协议，声明经营所得要用于资助学校。”我为Dizzy录了音，半年后他就去世了。不过在去世之前他就把我们所做的事情告诉了一个叫作McCoy Tyner的人Tyner来了，他说：“Dizzy在全国各地都谈起你们，我想帮助你们。”然后，一个叫做Wynton Marsalis也来了。之后是 一个叫 Ray Brown 的贝斯手、一个叫Stanley Turrentine的家伙、一个叫Herbie Hancock的钢琴师、一个叫Court Basie Orchestra的乐队、一个叫Tito Puente的家伙、还有 Gary Burton、 Shirley Horn、 Betty CarterDakota Staton和 Nancy Wilson他们都来过个内城中央的工业园里的中心演出。观众场场爆满。我很高兴的告诉你们，在这些艺术家的允许下，我已经制做了600张专辑都是世界上最伟大的艺术家们的音乐包括去世的Joe Williams他在我的学校录制了他的最后一张专辑。Joe Williams找到我，把他的手放在我的肩膀上说：“是上帝拣选了你，让你做这样的工作，愿我的音乐与你同在。”我们合作的很好。
en:I only have a couple more slides,and this is where the story gets kind of interesting.So, I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutesand you&#39;ll understand why he&#39;s there and I&#39;m here.In 1986, I had the presence of mind to stick a music hallon the north end of the building while I was building it.And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play therebecause he knew this man over here, Marty Ashby.And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound checkon a Wednesday afternoon, and I said,&quot;Dizzy, why would you come to a black-run centerin the middle of an industrial park with a high crime ratethat doesn&#39;t even have a reputation in music?&quot;He said, &quot;Because I heard you built the centerand I didn&#39;t believe that you did it, and I wanted to see for myself.And now that I have, I want to give you a gift.&quot;I said, &quot;You&#39;re the gift.&quot;He said, &quot;No, sir. You&#39;re the gift.And I&#39;m going to allow you to record the concertand I&#39;m going to give you the music,and if you ever choose to sell it, you must sign an agreementthat says the money will come back and support the school.&quot;And I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later,but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing.And he showed up and said,&quot;Dizzy talking about you all over the country, man,and I want to help you.&quot;And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up.Then a bass player named Ray Brown,and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine,and a piano player named Herbie Hancock,and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra,and a fellow named Tito Puente,and a guy named Gary Burton, and Shirley Horn, and Betty Carter,and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilsonall have come to this center in the middle of an industrial parkto sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city.And I&#39;m very pleased to tell you that, with their permission,I have now accumulated 600 recordingsof the greatest artists in the world,including Joe Williams, who died,but not before his last recording was done at my school.And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulderand he said, &quot;God&#39;s picked you, man, to do this work.And I want my music to be with you.&quot;And that worked out all right.

zh-cn:Basie乐团来了后，整个乐队都因学校感到激动，他们就投票决定把演出的版权给我。我就做他们录制了音乐，然后我们就赢得了一个叫做个格莱美的东西。我真是个傻瓜，我并没有参加颁奖典礼，因为我觉得我们赢不了。但是，我们确实赢了我们的名字被灯光打在了麦迪逊花园上空。然后UN Jazz管弦乐队又造访了我们，我们为他们录制了音乐第二次得到格莱美奖的提名。结果我们变成了美国的一个年轻而热门的爵士乐录音室（笑声）在这个犯罪率极高的市中心。
en:When the Basie band came, the band got so excited about the schoolthey voted to give me the rights to the music.And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy.And like a fool, I didn&#39;t go to the ceremonybecause I didn&#39;t think we were going to win.Well, we did win,and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden.Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded themand got nominated for a second Grammy back to back.So, we&#39;ve become one of the hot, young jazz recording studiosin the United States of America(Laughter)in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate.

zh-cn:这张照片是坐满了共和党人的音乐厅（笑声）（掌声）如果你当时在那儿丢一颗炸弹，那么全宾夕法尼亚州的财源就全被你断了，因为他们可都在那儿呢，我的父母也在其中，他们能活到足够大的年纪看着他们的孩子建好了这个建筑那是Dizzy,就像我告诉你们那样，他在那儿。那是Tito Puente，那是Pat Metheny和 Jim Hall，他们和我们录音。那是我们的第一个录音室，过去是一个扫帚间。我们只能把抹布什么的都放在走廊里，重新设计了这个房间，我们在那录制了第一次获得格莱美奖的专辑。
en:That&#39;s the place all filled up with Republicans.(Laughter)(Applause)If you&#39;d have dropped a bomb on that room,you&#39;d have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvaniabecause it was all sitting there.Including my mother and father, who lived long enoughto see their kid build that building.And there&#39;s Dizzy, just like I told you. He was there.And he was there, Tito Puente.And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were thereand they recorded with us.And that was our first recording studio, which was the broom closet.We put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thingand that&#39;s where we recorded the first Grammy.

zh-cn:这是我们的新录音室，全部使用视频技术。这个房间是我们为Nancy Wilson修造的，去年圣诞，她在我们的学校录制了专辑。如果你们中有谁正好在圣诞节看了“奥普拉”（一个电视节目）的话，你们就会看到到他和南希在节目里演唱了这张专辑里的部分歌曲，她把专辑的版权捐给了我们学校。我现在可以向你们打包票，一旦在“奥普拉”上露过一面，他的CD就能卖出一万张。（笑声）我们现在在全美音乐公告牌上排名第四，仅次于托尼Tony Bennett。我想我们的成绩会更好的。
en:And this is our new facility, which is all video technology.And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson,who recorded that album at our school last Christmas.And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfreyon Christmas Day, he was there and Nancy was theresinging excerpts from this album,the rights to which she donated to our school.And I can now tell you with absolute certaintythat an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs.(Laughter)We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts,right behind Tony Bennett.And I think we&#39;re going to be fine.

zh-cn:这张照片是一个在暴乱中烧毁的建筑—紧挨着我的学校。所以我又做了个硬纸板盒子，再次走上了街头。这就是那个新学校的模型，在它的右边是一个高科技的温室，中央是医学楼。我很高兴的告诉你们，这座楼已经建好了。这个建筑里全是有名的商户，一英尺20美元是市中心租价的三倍。这张是一个喷泉。（笑声）每一个建筑都有一个喷泉。匹兹堡大学医疗中心是这儿的大租户，他们租了一半的空间。我们现在就通过他们的系统来培训医疗技术人员。梅隆银行也租了这里，我很喜欢他们，因为他们按时交房租。（笑声）由于这层关系，我现在是梅隆金融公司的董事，这家公司买下了Dreyfus制药公司。
en:This was burned out during the riots — this is next to my building —and so I had another cardboard box builtand I walked back out in the streets again.And that&#39;s the building, and that&#39;s the model,and on the right&#39;s a high-tech greenhouseand in the middle&#39;s the medical technology building.And I&#39;m very pleased to tell you that the building&#39;s done.It&#39;s also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot —triple that in the middle of the inner city.And there&#39;s the fountain.(Laughter)Every building has a fountain.And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenantsand they took half the building,and we now train medical technicians through all their system.And Mellon Bank&#39;s a tenant.And I love them because they pay the rent on time.(Laughter)And as a result of the association,I&#39;m now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporationthat bought Dreyfus.

zh-cn:这个目前正在修建中把照片中的花房再扩大四倍就是今年10月份正式落成的样子了，因为我们要把这些花中在市中心。我们要让高中的孩子们在市中心种上蝴蝶兰。我们和一个大型零售商协定，让他们在六个州的240个商店里卖我们的兰花。我们的合作伙伴是一家西班牙裔开办的公司—加州马里布的Zuma Canyon Orchids。所以，西班牙裔和黑人达成了合作在市中心的中段来种植具有高科技含量的兰花。我告诉一个美国参议员，如果他能帮我们找到一些资金援助，我们就能上华尔街日报的左边栏的专栏。他答应了我们。所以我们最后得到了资助，我们的花房在今年秋季就要开业了。你们到时候一定要来看看—-这个才是故事的高潮。
en:And this is in the process of being built as we speak.Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhousethat&#39;s going to open in October this yearbecause we&#39;re going to grow those flowersin the middle of the inner city.And we&#39;re going to have high school kidsgrowing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city.And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocersto sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states.And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu, California,who are Hispanic.So, the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnershipto grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city.And I told my United States senatorthat there was a very high probabilitythat if he could find some funding for this,we would become a left-hand column in the Wall Street Journal,to which he readily agreed.And we got the funding and we open in the fall.And you ought to come and see it — it&#39;s going to be a hell of a story.

zh-cn:这张照片是长大以后，我想要做的事（笑声）那个棕色的大楼你们看到了吧，我告诉你们，我在它身上犯了一个巨大的错误。我曾经有机会把整个园区—距河边不到1000英尺—以400万美元的价格买下来，但是我没有买。你们知道在我修好第一个楼后发生了什么吗？我让这块地的地价涨得超出了所有人的想象，去年我出价800万美元要买下整个园区，园区的所有者拒绝了。他说：“斯特里克兰先生，你应该得到年度领袖大奖，因为你让我的地价升值到超出了我们想象的程度，非常感谢你。”这个故事告诉人们，人们要对他们所梦想的事情做好准备，以免梦想有机会成真的时候措手不及。
en:And this is what I want to do when I grow up.(Laughter)The brown building is the one you guys have been looking atand I&#39;ll tell you where I made my big mistake.I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park —which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront —for four million dollars and I didn&#39;t do it.And I built the first building, and guess what happened?I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody&#39;s expectationsand the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year,and said, &quot;Mr. Strickland,you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Awardbecause you&#39;ve appreciated our property valuesbeyond our wildest expectations.Thank you very much for that.&quot;The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams,just in case they do come true.

zh-cn:最后，请看这张照片。这个楼建在旧金山。我放这张照片的原因是，几年前我在一个很大的经济峰会上作一个幻灯片秀时，观众里一个人找到我，他说：“那个故事真的很棒，我也想要这样的一座中心。”我说“很荣幸，请问你是做哪一行的？”他说：“我经营一个城市，叫旧金山。我叫威利布朗。”我随便的接受了他的表扬就把这事儿抛在脑后了。那一周的周末，我正准备回家，Herbie Hancock晚上要在中心表演那是我第一次和他见面。他来到中心，说：“这是怎么回事？”我说：“赫比（Herbie）,穷人的培训中心就该是这个样子的。他说：“上帝作证，我想要建这样一个培训中心想了有25年了，现在你却实现了它。现在我真想修一个。”我说：“那...你要把它修在哪呢？”他说：“旧金山。”我说：“认识威利布朗吗？”（笑声）实际上，他确实认识威利布朗。威利布朗、赫比和我四年前一起吃晚餐，我们开始在桌布上描绘那个中心的蓝图。威利布朗说：“我以旧金山市市长的名义保证，我要修建这个学校，把它送给我们这座城市里的穷人。”他批给我旧金山湾附近5英亩的土地，我们还从其他人那里得到了帮助，比如一位设计师，一个总承包商，我们还有Herbie,惠普的朋友，Steelcase公司的朋友，思科(Cisco)的朋友，以及富国银行和Genentech的朋友。
en:And finally, there&#39;s this picture.This is in a place called San Francisco.And the reason this picture&#39;s in here isI did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit,and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me.He said, &quot;Man, that&#39;s a great story.I want one of those.&quot;I said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m very flattered. What do you do for a living?&quot;He says, &quot;I run the city of San Francisco.My name&#39;s Willie Brown.&quot;And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praiseand put it out of my mind.And that weekend, I was going back homeand Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night —first time I&#39;d met him.And he walked in and he says, &quot;What is this?&quot;And I said, &quot;Herbie, this is my concept of a training centerfor poor people.&quot;And he said, &quot;As God as my witness,I&#39;ve had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you&#39;ve built it.And now I really want to build one.&quot;I said, &quot;Well, where would you build this thing?&quot;He said, &quot;San Francisco.&quot;I said, &quot;Any chance you know Willie Brown?&quot;(Laughter)As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown,and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago,and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth.And Willie Brown said, &quot;As sure as I&#39;m the mayor of San Francisco,I&#39;m going to build this thingas a legacy to the poor people of this city.&quot;And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bayand we got an architect and we got a general contractorand we got Herbie on the board,and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase,and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargoand Genentech.

zh-cn:在硅谷做演讲时，我认识了一个个子很矮的人。演讲结束后，他找到我说：“你的故事真实太精彩了，我想帮助你。”我说：“非常感谢你能帮助我们，您是做哪一行的呢？”他说：“我开了一家公司，叫EBAY。”我说：“太好了。非常感谢你，请给我你的名片，我们将来可以聊聊。”我当时还不知道EBAY这家公司。不过，谨慎起见，我还是问了一下学校里的一些懂技术的学生，我说：“喂，EBAY是什么啊？”他说：“EBAY是一家网上商务公司。”我说：“我见过这家公司的老板，他给我留了名片。”我打电话给他说：“Skoll先生，恕我有眼不识泰山（笑声），我愿意和你交朋友。”（笑声）我和杰夫后来真的成为了朋友，他已经组织好一班人马，我们要开始修这个中心了。
en:And along the way, I met this real short guyat my slide show in the Silicon Valley.He came up to me afterwards,he said, &quot;Man, that&#39;s a fabulous story.I want to help you.&quot;And I said, &quot;Well, thank you very much for that.What do you do for a living?&quot;He said, &quot;Well, I built a company called eBay.&quot;I said, &quot;Well, that&#39;s very nice.Thanks very much, and give me your card and sometime we&#39;ll talk.&quot;I didn&#39;t know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano,but I had the presence of mind to go backand talk to one of the techie kids at my center.I said, &quot;Hey man, what is eBay?&quot;He said, &quot;Well, that&#39;s the electronic commerce network.&quot;I said, &quot;Well, I met the guy who built the thingand he left me his card.&quot;So, I called him up on the phone and I said, &quot;Mr. Skoll,I&#39;ve come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are(Laughter)and I&#39;d like to become your friend.&quot;(Laughter)And Jeff and I did become friends,and he&#39;s organized a team of peopleand we&#39;re going to build this center.
时间：30:36
zh-cn:然后我去来到将要修学校的社区，那地方叫 Bayview-Hunters Point，我说：“市长派我来和你们一来工作，我想和你们一起修这个培训中心，但是，如果你们不愿意，那我们就不修了。我唯一用来说服你们的东西就是一盒子幻灯片。”于是，在一个夏夜里，我站在200个非常愤怒非常沮丧的人前面，屋里的空调坏了，外面的温度有华氏100度，我开始给他们放这些幻灯片。看过10张照片后，他们就都静了下来，我把我的故事讲给他们听，最后说：“你们觉得怎么样？”在房间的后面，一位女士站起来说：“我在这个被上帝遗弃的地方生活了35年，你是唯一拿我们当人看的人。我跟定你了。”她影响了当时所有的观众。我向这些人保证，我们不仅要修而且要把它修好。我想我们今年就能开始修建了这座学校将以匹兹堡培训中心为模型来修建。
en:And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview-Hunters Point,and I said, &quot;The mayor sent me down here to work with youand I want to build a center with you,but I&#39;m not going to build you anything if you don&#39;t want it.And all I&#39;ve got is a box of slides.&quot;And so I stood up in front of 200 very angry, very disappointed peopleon a summer night, and the air conditioner had brokenand it was 100 degrees outside,and I started showing these pictures.And after about 10 pictures they all settled down.And I ran the story and I said, &quot;What do you think?&quot;And in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said,&quot;In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place,you&#39;re the only person that&#39;s come down here and treated us with dignity.I&#39;m going with you, man.&quot;And she turned that audience around on a pin.And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing,and we&#39;re going to build it all right.And I think we can get in the ground this yearas the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh.
时间：31:48
zh-cn:后来我碰见了Quincy Jones，给他看了这盒幻灯片。Quincy说：“我想帮助你，我们在洛杉矶也建一个吧。”然后他也组织了一批人然后我像爱上了他如同我爱上Herbie和他的音乐一样Quincy说：“修建这样的培训中心的想法是从哪来的呢？”我说：“这都来自你的音乐。当我16岁时在制陶课上，当世界还是一片漆黑的时候，ROSS先生带来你的专辑，你的专辑让我回到了阳光里。”我说：“随着那些音乐，我就重新沐浴在阳光下，我就会好起来。如果不是那样的话，我怎么会取得现在的成就？”
en:But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the wayand I showed him the box of slides.And Quincy said, &quot;I want to help you, man.Let&#39;s do one in L.A.&quot;And so he&#39;s assembled a group of people.And I&#39;ve fallen in love with him,as I have with Herbie and with his music.And Quincy said, &quot;Where did the idea for centers like this come from?&quot;And I said, &quot;It came from your music, man.Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albumswhen I was 16 years old in the pottery class,when the world was all dark,and your music got me to the sunlight.&quot;And I said, &quot;If I can follow that music,I&#39;ll get out into the sunlight and I&#39;ll be OK.And if that&#39;s not true, how did I get here?&quot;
时间：32:47
zh-cn:我想让你们所有人都明白：我认为，这个世界是值得我们生活的地方。我相信你们，我相信你们的希望、你们的梦想。我相信你们的才智，我相信你们的热情。我厌倦了这样的生活方式：来到一座又一座城市，人们站在街角，眼睛里是空洞的眼神，没有魂魄。不扭转这种状况的话，我们又怎么能成为一个国家呢？在宾夕法尼亚，把那些看起来我一样的人关在监狱里要花6万美元。但是修匹兹堡大学医学院才花4万美元。建医学院比把人关进监狱还要少花2万美元。你们算算，靠把人关起来永远都没用。我要向你们寻求帮助，向Herbie, Quincy, Hackett, Richard和那些还有一点信仰的好人寻求帮助。我希望在每一个城市，每一个小镇，都做这个事业，并为之付出一生。我认为我并没有发疯。我觉得我们能把这些东西带回家里，我想我们可以在全国各处花费比修监狱更少的钱修建这些学校我相信，我们能把人们的悲惨生活转变成一个圆满的大结局。这种工作难度很大—你们都像鲑鱼一样要力争上游，钱永远都不够，需要办的总是太多。所以容易产生一种职业性的抑郁。长久以来，我终于找到了一个避免这种抑郁的办法那就是在每一个城镇都交一个朋友，这样你就永远都不会感到孤单。我希望，我今天晚上在这儿也能交一些朋友。感谢大家听我的故事。（掌声）
en:I want you all to knowthat I think the world is a place that&#39;s worth living.I believe in you.I believe in your hopes and your dreams,I believe in your intelligenceand I believe in your enthusiasm.And I&#39;m tired of living like this,going into town after town with people standing around on cornerswith holes where eyes used to be, their spirits damaged.We won&#39;t make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around.In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail,most of whom look like me.It&#39;s 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School.It&#39;s 20,000 dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail.Do the math — it will never work.I am banking on youand I&#39;m banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richardand very decent people who still believe in something.And I want to do this in my lifetime, in every city and in every town.And I don&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy.I think we can get home on this thingand I think we can build these all over the countryfor less money than we&#39;re spending on prisons.And I believe we can turn this whole story aroundto one of celebration and one of hope.In my business it&#39;s very difficult work.You&#39;re always fighting upstream like a salmon —never enough money, too much need —and so there is a tendencyto have an occupational depression that accompanies my work.And so I&#39;ve figured out, over time, the solution to the depression:you make a friend in every town and you&#39;ll never be lonely.And my hope is that I&#39;ve made a few here tonight.And thanks for listening to what I had to say.(Applause)
