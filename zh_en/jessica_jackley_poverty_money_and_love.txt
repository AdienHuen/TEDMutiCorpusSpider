zh-cn:我们互相讲述的故事非常重要我们谈论与自己生活相关故事是有意义的而我认为最重要的是我们参与到他人故事的方式才是至关重要的我六岁时当我第一次听到关于穷人的故事的时候我并没有直接从穷人口中听到这些故事我从教堂周日学校的老师那里听到这些故事和耶稣，也就是这些老师那里我记得我学到了穷人需要物质帮助如食物，衣服，住处，那些他们没有的我还学到了我们这些五六岁的孩子应该做的是很明显，去帮助这也是耶稣需要我们做的他还说，你为他们做的就是为我做的现在， 我被极大的鼓舞了我非常热切地希望自己能向世界证明自己的意义相信我们都有这样的感觉此外，有意思的是上帝也需要帮助那对我来说真是个新闻而且，这是貌似一个很重要的事情值得我们参与
en:The stories we tell about each othermatter very much.The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.And most of all,I think the way that we participate in each other&#39;s storiesis of deep importance.I was six years oldwhen I first heard stories about the poor.Now I didn&#39;t hear those stories from the poor themselves,I heard them from my Sunday school teacherand Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.I remember learning that people who were poorneeded something material —food, clothing, shelter — that they didn&#39;t have.And I also was taught, coupled with that,that it was my job — this classroom full of five and six year-old children —it was our job, apparently, to help.This is what Jesus asked of us.And then he said, &quot;What you do for the least of these, you do for me.&quot;Now I was pretty psyched.I was very eager to be useful in the world —I think we all have that feeling.And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.That was news to me,and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.

zh-cn:但是自从耶稣说了那句话之后，我也很快地理解了耶稣所说那我同时将其释义为贫穷和我们同在这让我沮丧和迷惑我感觉我被安排了一个不得不做的同时令人振奋的作业但是不论我做什么，我都会失败因此我感到迷茫，有点郁闷以及恼怒好像我似乎误解了这里的一些东西同时我感到了压力这也是第一次我开始害怕一类人群并对这一人群有负面的情绪我的脑袋里呈现出这些人组成的长队这个长队将一直伴随我们，永不会离去他们会总是不停地要求我的帮助，要求我给他们东西这些虽然都是我喜欢做的但是我并不知道将来会发生什么我不知道但我无物可给的时候将会发生什么特别是这个问题永远不会离去几年之后我听到一些其他的故事关于减贫并不是那么积极例如，我曾经看到了令人悲伤和苦恼的一些照片和图像我听到穷人生活的不尽如人意关于疾病，关于战争似乎这些都是和贫穷相关联的总的来说我有个这样的想法穷人生活的世界充满悲伤，充满苦闷充满破坏，充满绝望
en:But I also learned very soon thereafterthat Jesus also said, and I&#39;m paraphrasing,the poor would always be with us.This frustrated and confused me;I felt like I had been just given a homework assignmentthat I had to do, and I was excited to do,but no matter what I would do, I would fail.So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,like maybe I&#39;d misunderstood something here.And I felt overwhelmed.And for the first time,I began to fear this group of peopleand to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individualsthat were never going away, that would always be with us.They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,which I was excited to do,but I didn&#39;t know how it was going to work.And I didn&#39;t know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,especially if the problem was never going away.In the years following,the other stories I heard about the poor growing upwere no more positive.For example, I saw pictures and imagesfrequently of sadness and suffering.I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.I heard about disease, I heard about war —they always seemed to be kind of related.And in general,I got this sort of ideathat the poor in the world lived livesthat were wrought with suffering and sadness,devastation, hopelessness.

zh-cn:在那之后，我想到我们大家的感觉就是这个可预知的回应当我每次听到穷人时，我开始感觉不舒服由于我的相对富裕让我开始感觉到罪恶很明显的是因为我没有尽我所能把事情做得更好因此，我感到羞愧自然地我开始疏远我自己我不再像以前一样细心地倾听他们的故事我不再期望事情能真正有所改变我还是会给予。表面看来，我似乎还在继续参与给予我的时间和金钱我给予的都是廉价的方案一杯咖啡就是救一个孩子的命，是这样的我的意思是谁能说那是错的呢？当我无路可退时，当我难以推辞时，我才给予总体来说，负面情绪驱使我给予我的给予是为了减轻我自己的烦恼而不是其他人的确实，我离开了那里地方但我并没有远离希望之地没有远离帮助他人和慷慨解囊的兴奋它变成了我的一个转折点变成了一种交易我是在购买什么东西我是在购买我继续生存且不被这些糟糕新闻烦恼的权利我认为我们采用的这种方法，有时候首先能够让一部分人或者一些个体灵魂出窍这种想法也能够变成一种商品一种令人恐怖的东西就是正如我所说所想我们好像在购买我们之间的距离我们好像在购买我们继续生活的权利我想这种交易事实上阻碍了我们得到我们最想得到的东西阻碍了我们的愿望就是给予对他人真正有意义和有用的东西即，去爱
en:And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,is this predictable response,where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,because I wasn&#39;t doing more, apparently, to make things better.And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.And so naturally,I started to distance myself.I stopped listening to their storiesquite as closely as I had before.And I stopped expecting things to really change.Now I still gave — on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.I gave of my time and my money,I gave when solutions were on sale.The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child&#39;s life, right.I mean who can argue with that?I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoidand I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enoughthat I gave to relieve my own suffering,not someone else&#39;s.The truth be told, I was giving out of that place,not out of a genuine place of hopeand excitement to help and of generosity.It became a transaction for me,became sort of a trade.I was purchasing something —I was buying my right to go on with my dayand not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.And I think the way that we go through that sometimescan, first of all,disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.And it can also turn into a commodity,which is a very scary thing.So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,we kind of buy our distance,we kind of buy our right to go on with our day.I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.It can get in the way of our desireto really be meaningful and useful in another person&#39;s lifeand, in short to love.

zh-cn:欣慰地是，几年之后，我被改变了因为我听了穆罕默德·尤努斯博士的演讲在座大部分人也许知道他是谁但我还是想给没有听说过他的人做个简短的叙述尤努斯博士在几年前获得了诺贝尔和平奖因为他在现代微金融领域所做的先驱工作在他获得诺贝尔和平奖三年之前，我就听了他的演讲如果你对微金融是陌生的，基本上，它可以理解为给穷人提供的金融服务就是，所有你在银行里可以获得的以及可以想到的针对每天只有几美元生活费的人所提供的产品和服务尤努斯博士分享了他的故事阐述了事情的原貌以及他和他的格莱珉银行所做到的他也讲到了，特别是，微信贷即，能够帮助人们创业和企业发展的微型贷款他的演讲有如下几点原因让我感到兴奋第一，我学到了一种新的方法来改变世界其曾经向我展示了一种和他人互动的方式并且给出一种让人不感到怪异的分享资源的方式同时，这种方式不让我感到难堪很不错但更重要的是，他讲述关于穷人的故事和我以前听到的故事有很多不同事实上，以前听到的穷人在各方面都是弱势的但他所讲的穷人是坚强，聪明，刻苦的企业家们这些企业家起早贪黑，努力地工作为了让他们和他们家人有更好的生活他们只需少量的资金就能更快地，更好地拥有他们理想的生活这对我来说是一个令人惊叹的见解
en:Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for mebecause I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,but to give the shorthand versionfor any who have not heard him speak,Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years agofor his work pioneering modern microfinance.When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.But basically, microfinance — if this is new to you as well —think of that as financial services for the poor.Think of all the things you get at your bankand imagine those products and servicestailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.Dr. Yunus shared his story,explaining what that was,and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.He also talked about, in particular, microlending,which is a tiny loanthat could help someone start or grow a business.Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the worldthat, for once, showed me, maybe,a way to interact with someoneand to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn&#39;t weirdand didn&#39;t make me feel bad —that was exciting.But more importantly, he told stories about the poorthat were different than any stories I had heard before.In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.He was talking about strong, smart,hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every dayand were doing things to make their lives and their family&#39;s lives better.All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it betterwas a little bit of capital.It was an amazing sort of insight for me.

zh-cn:事实上，我被这个见解真真的打动了很难表达这个观点对我有多大的影响不论如何，我确实被打动了。我也的确在几周后放弃了我的工作继而搬迁到了东非就是想亲自看看情况这么长时间里，这是确实是第一次，我想见到这些人，我想去见这些企业家并亲自看看他们真实的生活因此，我在肯尼亚，乌干达，坦桑尼亚呆了3个月和那些企业家们进行了交流就是用100美元贷款创业或者拓展业务的企业家们事实上，通过这些交流我第一次开始和这些各色各样的原先本来远离我的人们成了朋友我开始不断地交朋友并了解到他们的个人生活我和他们交谈并且他们在一起待几天我的确听到了他们生活改变的故事以及那些令人惊叹的生活细节改变
en:And I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this —it&#39;s hard to express now how much that affected me —but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,and I moved to East Africato try to see for myself what this was about.For the first time, actually, in a long timeI wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,and see for myself what their lives were actually about.So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzaniainterviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollarsto start or grow a business.And in fact, through those interactions,for the first time, I was starting to get to be friendswith some of those people in that big amorphous group out therethat was supposed to be far away.I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.And over and over again,as I interviewed them and spent my days with them,I did hear stories of life changeand amazing little details of change.

zh-cn:因此，我希望能够听到那些牧羊人能够用他们得到的贷款去买更多的山羊他们的商业轨迹改变了他们能够赚更多的钱他们的生活质量改变了，并变的更好了他们能够对他们的生活做些细小的但卓有意义的调整比如，他们可以开始把他们的孩子送去学校他们可以买蚊帐也许他们可以买得起一个门锁让他们感到更安全也许，仅仅是他们可以在他们的茶里放糖当我做客时来款待我这让他们感到自豪即使我和20个不同的牧羊人聊天，也会有很多美丽的细节。相信总有一天这些美丽的令生活改变的细节对他们来说是意义非凡的这是另一个令我触动的事情这是我第一次谦虚的感受到以至于确实懂得即使我会用魔法棒并能够修好所有东西但是我也很有可能把事情搞砸因为让人们改变生活的最好的方式就是让他们自己去控制并按照他们自己认为最佳的方式进行我看到了这一点，我感到那是很震撼人心的
en:So I would hear from goat herderswho had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.Their business trajectory would change.They would make a little bit more money;their standard of livingwould shift and would get better.And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,like they would start to send their children to school.They might be able to buy mosquito nets.Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their teaand offer that to me when I came as their guestand that made them feel proud.But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,and some days that&#39;s what happened —these beautiful details of life changethat were meaningful to them.That was another thing that really touched me.It was really humbling to see for the first time,to really understandthat even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.Because the best way for people to change their livesis for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.So I saw that and it was very humbling.

zh-cn:此外，还有一件事情很有意思我从未被要求捐助这似乎是我的作风，是吧？这里有贫困，你该给予金钱的帮助没有人请求我来捐款事实上，没有人想让我怜悯他们他们只是想把自己的事业做得更好同时加强他们自己的能力因此，我一直听到的是人们需要贷款我认为这听起来很合理并真的很令人激动顺便说一下，我在大学里学的是哲学和诗歌因此我在东非时并不懂利润和销售的区别我留下的印象是，钱就可以帮助他们我的业务开端就是这些100美元的资金注入我学到了利润，销售，杠杆和相关的知识从农民，缝纫女工，牧羊人那里将这个想法这些商业和希望的新奇故事和我的朋友和家人分享以此，我们就能够得到他们需要的钱这些钱作为贷款让他们继续他们的事业就是这样的一个点子变成了Kiva
en:Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.I never once was asked for a donation,which had kind of been my mode, right.There&#39;s poverty, you give money to help —no one asked me for a donation.In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing alreadyand to build on their own capabilities.So what I did hear, once in a while,was that people wanted a loan —I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,so I didn&#39;t know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.I just got this impression that the money would work.And my introduction to businesswas in these $100 little infuses of capital.And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.So this ideathat these new stories of business and hopemight be shared with my friends and family,and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they neededto be able to continue their businesses as loans,that&#39;s this little idea that turned into Kiva.

zh-cn:几个月之后，我回到了乌干达带着数码相机和一个很简单的网站我和我的合作伙伴，Matthew一起做的然后给我的七个新朋友照了些照片并在网上贴出了他们的创业故事随后疯狂地给朋友和家人发，并声称“我们没犯法”虽然还没有从证监会那里得到反馈但是你觉得怎么样，想参与下么？给需要钱的人提供资金?这些钱当天晚上就发过来了我们就发给乌干达六个月之后，美妙是事情发生了这些企业家支付了他们的借款同时他们的事业也蒸蒸日上他们能够丰衣足食了他们的生活轨迹改变了2005年十月份在这七笔贷款都返还后Matt和我取消了网页上的beta标志(测试期)我们认为：这个小测验取得了成功我们开始正式运营这个网站在这之后的第一年，即2005年十月至2006年十月Kiva协助了50万美元的贷款第二年，总额变成了1500万美元第三年，到了4000万第四年，差不多1个亿了至今，不到五年时间里Kiva协助了超过1.5亿美元的贷款，这可都是一个个25美元积累出来的哦这些钱来自放贷人和企业家们他们来自世界200个国家
en:A few months later, I went back to Ugandawith a digital camera and a basic websitethat my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,and took pictures of seven of my new friends,posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,spammed friends and family and said, &quot;We think this is legal.Haven&#39;t heard back yet from SEC on all the details,but do you say, do you want to help participate in this,provide the money that they need?&quot;The money came in basically overnight.We sent it over to Uganda.And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;the entrepreneurs received the money,they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,and they were able to support themselvesand change the trajectory of their lives.In October of &#39;05,after those first seven loans were paid,Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.We said, &quot;Our little experiment has been a success.Let&#39;s start for real.&quot; That was our official launch.And then that first year, October &#39;05 through &#39;06,Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.The second year, it was a total of 15 million.The third year, the total was up to around 40.The fourth year, we were just short of 100.And today, less than five years in,Kiva&#39;s facilitatedmore than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,from lenders and entrepreneurs —more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.

zh-cn:这就是你今天看到的Kiva这些数字和统计结果对我来说很有趣也很有意思对我来说，Kiva充满了故事它重述着穷人的故事以及给他们一个机会来积极参与并承担责任这证明了他们的尊严证明了一种合作的关系而不是以前那种基于捐款人和受款人那种古怪的关系现在的这种合作关系促进了尊敬和希望还有就是这种乐观向上的精神让我们携手共进我希望这些钱不仅能够通过Kiva流动那是非常积极的和有意义的事情而且我希望Kiva能够模糊传统的富裕和贫穷之间的界限也就是我们小时候所认为的世界这个错误的二分法将世界分隔成我们和他们， 有产和无产我希望Kiva能够模糊这种界限因为，当其发生时我想我们能够自由地交流以更开放，更公正，更有创造力的方式来相互激励，相互帮助
en:So that&#39;s where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.And while those numbers and those statisticsare really fun to talk about and they&#39;re interesting,to me, Kiva&#39;s really about stories.It&#39;s about retellingthe story of the poor,and it&#39;s about giving ourselvesan opportunity to engagethat validates their dignity,validates a partnership relationship,not a relationship that&#39;s basedon the traditional sort of donor beneficiaryweirdness that can happen.But instead a relationship that can promote respectand hopeand this optimismthat together we can move forward.So what I hope is that,not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva —that&#39;s a very positive and meaningful thing —but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,between the traditional rich and poor categoriesthat we&#39;re taught to see in the world,this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.Because as that happens,I think we can feel free to interactin a way that&#39;s more open, more just and more creative,to engage with each other and to help each other.

zh-cn:想象一下你的感觉当你看到一个人在街上乞讨时而你又向他走去想象一下你自己的感觉这个人的不同的情形这个人的创业故事和他所做的努力这个人期望谈论他们的事业他们微笑着谈论他们的成就试想，如果你正在事业蓬勃向上的人交谈某人用他的智慧卓有成效地工作某人从零开始创业他能够丰衣足食并远离贫穷他确实在创造富足他手上有东西可以奉献而不是两手空空地向你索要东西试想，如果你能够听到你期望听到的故事某人每天起床工作努力，生活蒸蒸日上这些故事确实能够改变我们思考对方的方式如果我们能催化出一个支持性的社区来帮助这些人来参与他们的故事给他们提供一点钱我想那就能改变我们互信的方式以及相互的潜力
en:Imagine how you feelwhen you see somebody on street who is beggingand you&#39;re about to approach them.Imagine how you feel;and then imagine the difference when you might see somebodywho has a story of entrepreneurship and hard workwho wants to tell you about their business.Maybe they&#39;re smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they&#39;ve done.Imagine if you&#39;re speaking with somebodywho&#39;s growing things and making them flourish,somebody who&#39;s using their talentsto do something productive,somebody who&#39;s built their own business from scratch,someone who is surrounded by abundance,not scarcity,who&#39;s in fact creating abundance,somebody with full hands with something to offer,not empty handsasking for you to give them something.Imagine if you could hear a story you didn&#39;t expectof somebody who wakes up every dayand works very, very hard to make their life better.These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.And if we can catalyzea supportive community to come around these individualsand to participate in their storyby lending a little bit of money,I think that can change the way we believe in each otherand each other&#39;s potential.

zh-cn:现在对我来说，Kiva只是刚刚开始当我寻找下一个目标时我至今学到的这些是非常有帮助的第一就是，我所提到的，创业是新观点Kiva的借款人，在我和他们交谈时，在我了解他们几年后他们教会我什么是创业我认为，它的核心是一种让生活更美好的决心你看到了机会你决定去做些什么来把握机会即，明天会更好并持续这种信念第二件事就是，这些贷款是很有意思的交流工具他们不是为了捐款是的，好像听起来差不多但事实上，当你给予时他们说谢谢并告诉你事情的发展那仅是一方面当你借钱时，他们慢慢地还钱你有了借口来持续对话这种持续性的关注，不断发展的关注才是至关重要的这建立起我们之间的各种不同的关系第三，我从这些企业家那里学到了我该知道的东西在同等情况下一个选择是仅仅给他们钱，让他们做他们需要做的事情另一个选择是钱以及来自全球的支持和鼓励人们选择的是第二个这是一个更加有意义的组合，更有力量的组合
en:Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.And as I look forward to what is next,it&#39;s been helpful to reflect on the things I&#39;ve learned so far.The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,have taught me what entrepreneurship is.And I think, at its core, it&#39;s deciding that you want your life to be better.You see an opportunityand you decide what you&#39;re going to do to try to seize that.In short, it&#39;s deciding that tomorrow can better than todayand going after that.Second thing that I&#39;ve learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.So they&#39;re not a donation.Yeah, maybe it doesn&#39;t sound that much different.But in fact, when you give something to someoneand they say, &quot;Thanks,&quot; and let you know how things go,that&#39;s one thing.When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.This continued attention — this ongoing attention —is a really big dealto build different kinds of relationships among us.And then third, from what I&#39;ve heard from the entrepreneurs I&#39;ve gotten to know,when all else is equal,given the option to have just money to do what you need to do,or money plus the support and encouragementof a global community,people choose the community plus the money.That&#39;s a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.
时间：12:57
zh-cn:有了那样的想法，这特别的需求引导出了我现在所做的我看到了各个地方的企业家们，是我乐于看到的我还看到了一件事世界上已经有很多支持性社区存在了通过社交网络一种令人惊奇的方式，让和我们有共同目标的人的数量在我们的支持性社区里迅速增长也因此，我曾想过这些我一直在想，如何我们能够激励这些支持性社区去催化更多的创业点子去催化更多像我们一样的人让明天更美好呢我研究了一些在美国发生的事情几个很有意思的事情其中一个是，当然，众望所归很多美国的和世界范围内的小企业仍旧需要资金来成长和扩张或者他们需要资金度过某个艰难时期对资源的需求总是存在的但是这些资源通常不是来源于你所期望的地方比如银行，风投或者一些组织和支持性结构这些资源来自于朋友和家庭一些数据显示85%或更多的小企业的资金来源于朋友和家庭每年大概有1300亿美元很多啊第三，对于这些从朋友和家庭来筹集资金的人们是很尴尬的，他们不知道怎么开口也不知道怎么来担保回报即使他们有最佳的计划并想感谢这些帮助他们的人们
en:So with that in mind, this particular incidenthas led to the things that I&#39;m working on now.I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I&#39;m tuned into this.And one thing that I&#39;ve seenis there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.With social networks,it&#39;s an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around usin our own supportive communities, rapidly.And so, as I have been thinking about this,I&#39;ve been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communitiesto catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideasand to catalyze all of usto make tomorrow better than today?As I&#39;ve researched what&#39;s going on in the United States,a few interesting little insights have come up.So one is that, of course, as we all might expect,many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the worldstill need money to grow and to do more of what they want to door they might need money during a hard month.But there&#39;s always a need for resources close by.Another thing is, it turns out,those resources don&#39;t usually come from the places you might expect —banks, venture capitalists,other organizations and support structures —they come from friends and family.Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businessescomes from friends and family.That&#39;s around 130 billion dollars a year —it&#39;s a lot.And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,it&#39;s very awkward, people don&#39;t know exactly what to ask for,how to ask, what to promise in return,even though they have the best of intentionsand want to thank those people that are supporting them.
时间：14:16
zh-cn:因此，以一种全新的方式来使用支持性社区的力量并让企业家自己去决定是什么样的金融交易的方式以及他们所适合的和他们周围的人事实上，这周我们低调地启动了Profounder一个“众筹”平台让他们朋友和家人投资这些小企业这些投资不是捐款，也不是贷款而是具有动态回报的投资这个“故事”的映射事实上，时上时下基本上，这是一个自己动手的工具用于小企业融资你所要做的就是浏览这个网站，然后建立主页以简单明了的方式建立投资条款我们要让它简明扼要也让其他用这个网站的人觉得简明扼要我们允许创业者分享一定百分比的销售额他们可以融资上百万美元从无限的，未认证的，投资理念简单的投资者那里—都是些普通的投资者嘛，上帝会允许滴—他们能够分享回报不论什么他们设置的什么条款当投资者参与其中时基于这些条款他们能够得到现金回报或者他们可以提前决定将这些回报送给非盈利组织因此，他们可以做现金投资者或者非现金回报投资者我的希望是这类的工具能给任何有帮助别人想法人们一条途径去做他们想做的凝聚他们周围的人这些最了解的他们人爱他们的以及想帮助他们的人大家一起将梦想变成现实
en:So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new wayand to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselvesexactly what that financial exchange should look like,exactly what fits them and the people around them,this week actually,we&#39;re quietly doing a launch of Profounder,which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they needthrough investments from their friends and family.And it&#39;s investments, not donations, not loans,but investments that have a dynamic return.So the mapping of participating in the story,it actually flows with the up and down.So in short, it&#39;s a do-it-yourself toolfor small businesses to raise these funds.And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,create investment terms in a really easy way.We make it really, really simple for meas well as anyone else who wants to use the site.And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.They can raise up to a million dollarsfrom an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors —everyday people, heaven forbid —and they can share those returns over time —again, whatever terms they set.As investors choose to become involvedbased on those terms,they can either take their rewards back as cash,or they can decide in advanceto give those returns away to a non-profit.So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.It&#39;s my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an ideaa path to go do what they want to do in the worldand to gather the people around them that they already have,the people that know them bestand that love them and want to support them,to gather them to make this happen.

zh-cn:那就是我现在做的更进一步，我就想说，看看这些工具现在，Profounder才刚刚开始它是可以触及的，是清楚的。它就是一根血管，一个工具我们需要人们的关注并去使用它就想他们关注并使用Kiva一样来连接彼此好消息是我不认为我站在这里是想说服你们，去关注我根本不想尝试我不认为，即使我们经常听到那些道德和品质的原因还有宗教的原因比如，这就是为什么关心和给予让你感到幸福之类的我不需要去解释，你们懂的。事实上，我想我们非常了解现实我们很关心的现实实际上，通常让我们停下来的是我们害怕尝试害怕失败因为我们太关心彼此想在彼此的生活中做些有意义的事情
en:So that&#39;s what I&#39;m working on now.And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.Right now, Profounder&#39;s right at the very beginning,and it&#39;s very palpable; it&#39;s very clear to me, that it&#39;s just a vessel, it&#39;s just a tool.What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,just like they&#39;ve cared enough to use Kivato make those connections.But the good news is I don&#39;t think I need to stand here and convince you to care —I&#39;m not even going to try.I don&#39;t think, even though we often hear,you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,the religious reasons,&quot;Here&#39;s why caring and giving will make you happier.&quot;I don&#39;t think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;in fact, I think we know so much,and it&#39;s such a realitythat we care so deeply,that in fact, what usually stops usis that we&#39;re afraid to try and to mess up,because we care so very much about helping each otherand being meaningful in each other&#39;s lives.

zh-cn:我想我今天能做的就是给你讲述我的故事，我已尽我所能了我想提醒大家我们真的很在乎我们都很清楚我想我们明白爱是足够坚韧的让我们尽可能的去尝试稍等（感动啊~~）
en:So what I think I can do today,that best thing I can give you —I&#39;ve given you my story, which is the best I can do.And I think I can remind us that we do care.I think we all already know that.And I think we know that love is resilient enoughfor us to get out there and try.Just a sec.

zh-cn:对我来说，最好的激励自己去尝试的方法就是停下来并倾听别人的故事在此，我很感谢TED让我站在这里我同时感激无论何时我保证，我都是倍受激励的我被那些有故事的人激励着每次我倾听他们的故事，我都会越来越相信对这个世界所做的伟大的贡献的人和我自己所提供的帮助因此忘了那些工具吧，忘了移动那些资源它们都不算什么相信彼此才是真正的价值我们每一个人都能为这个世界出一把力那才是将故事变成爱的原因以及把最后的故事变成一个持续永恒的希望和对我们都有益的事业因此，相信彼此执此信念，坚定不移不论你做什么，都积极地实践这种信念我相信这种信念终将改变世界并让明天更美好
en:For me, the best way to be inspired to tryis to stop and to listento someone else&#39;s story.And I&#39;m grateful that I&#39;ve gotten to do that here at TED.And I&#39;m grateful that whenever I do that,guaranteed, I am inspired —I am inspired by the person I am listening to.And I believe more and more every time I listenin that that person&#39;s potential to do great things in the worldand in my own potential to maybe help.And that —forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources —that stuff&#39;s easy.Believing in each other,really being sure when push comes to shovethat each one of us can do amazing things in the world,that is what can make our stories into love storiesand our collective storyinto one that continually perpetuates hopeand good things for all of us.So that, this belief in each other,knowing that without a doubtand practicing that every day in whatever you do,that&#39;s what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.
