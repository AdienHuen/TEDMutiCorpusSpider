zh-cn:十九世纪末英国一位着名诗人写了这样一首诗在 1930 年时，它被誉为丘吉尔脑海中的回响诗是这样的闲荡夏林间溪自细细流遥听远鼓响鼓乐疑梦音无常世间道珍重朋与辈，碾食成粉末战士踏征途魂销沙场渺对诗词有兴趣的朋友这是豪斯曼的《施罗普希尔的少年》
en:There&#39;s a poem writtenby a very famous English poetat the end of the 19th century.It was said to echo in Churchill&#39;s brainin the 1930s.And the poem goes:&quot;On the idle hill of summer,lazy with the flow of streams,hark I hear a distant drummer,drumming like a sound in dreams,far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,dear to friend and food to powder,soldiers marching,soon to die.&quot;Those who are interested in poetry,the poem is &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; written by A.E. Housman.

zh-cn:但豪斯曼感悟些什么呢和你在尼尔森交响乐中听到的一样是那19 世纪，又长，又闷热,平静的夏季森林即将结束我们将进入一个可怕的权力转变的历史周期女士先生们，这时代通常会伴随着动乱和流血事件
en:But what Housman understood,and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too,was that the long, hot, silvan summersof stability of the 19th centurywere coming to a close,and that we were about to moveinto one of those terrifying periods of historywhen power changes.And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen,accompanied by turbulence,and all too often by blood.

zh-cn:我给你的信息是我相信我们坐上了同一条船活在历史洪流中的同一时刻当你遇上固有权力的秩序开始改变新世界新力量开始形成这些 — 我们今天很清楚看见都是些超混乱，特艰难的年代和常有的流血时期。顺道一提，它大概一世纪出现一次
en:And my message for youis that I believe we are condemned, if you like,to live at just one of those moments in historywhen the gimbals upon whichthe established order of power is beginning to changeand the new look of the world,the new powers that exist in the world,are beginning to take form.And these are — and we see it very clearly today —nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times,and all too often very bloody times.By the way, it happens about once every century.

zh-cn:你也许不认同最后那次的发生时间 –就是豪斯曼和丘吉尔同时察觉的欧洲旧国家，旧势力权力转移到大西洋对岸新冒起的美国开始了美国世纪当然，在欧洲势力下坡的最后年代交替的空窗期出现了两次屠杀大灾难前后两次的世界大战毛泽东称它为欧洲内战这形容确也贴切
en:You might argue that the last time it happened —and that&#39;s what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too —was that when power passed from the old nations,the old powers of Europe,across the Atlantic to the new emerging powerof the United States of America —the beginning of the American century.And of course, into the vacuumwhere the too-old European powers used to bewere played the two bloody catastrophesof the last century —the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars,and it&#39;s probably a more accurate way of describing them.

zh-cn:好，女士先生们我们生活在这当下为了我们，今天我打算谈谈三个原素这当中的头一个是有关权力转移至于， 第二个我称它为新领域过去好像都没出现过我们先说说发生中的权力转移今天出现的有点令人惊栗因为它从没发生过我们见过权力的横向转移权力从希腊过渡到罗马和欧洲社会出现的权力转移但我们看到的现状稍异权力不单是横向在国与国间游走它也纵向移动
en:Well, ladies and gentlemen,we live at one of those times.But for us, I want to talk about three factors today.And the first of these, the first two of these,is about a shift in power.And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to,which has never quite happened in the way it&#39;s happening now.But let&#39;s talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.And what is happening todayis, in one sense, frighteningbecause it&#39;s never happened before.We have seen lateral shifts of power —the power of Greece passed to Romeand the power shifts that occurredduring the European civilizations —but we are seeing something slightly different.For power is not just moving laterallyfrom nation to nation.It&#39;s also moving vertically.

zh-cn:今天出现的权力转移，更包括和国家宪法里的责任和法律的裁决今天都很大程度搬上了国际舞台权力全球化我们讲市场全球化但真正全球化的是权力但在国家层面上权力的层次是受法律的约束在国际舞台便不一样现今国际和环球舞台上的权力属于互联网、卫星广播货币兑换巨额钞票的流转融资额度约是贸易需求的32倍货币兑客, 你可称之为金融投机家近来，他们所为相当令人拜服现今跨国企业的编制预算的财力比一般中等国家还要大生存在国际舞台绝大部分不受监管既不受法律规管行动又不受约束
en:What&#39;s happening today is that the power that was encased,held to accountability, held to the rule of law,within the institution of the nation statehas now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.The globalization of power —we talk about the globalization of markets,but actually it&#39;s the globalization of real power.And where, at the nation state levelthat power is held to accountabilitysubject to the rule of law,on the international stage it is not.The international stage and the global stage where power now resides:the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters,the power of the money changers —this vast money-go-roundthat circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessaryfor the trade it&#39;s supposed to be there to finance —the money changers, if you like,the financial speculatorsthat have brought us all to our knees quite recently,the power of the multinational corporationsnow developing budgetsoften bigger than medium-sized countries.These live in a global spacewhich is largely unregulated,not subject to the rule of law,and in which people may act free of constraint.
时间： 4:15
zh-cn:直至现在都有利权势人士在无约束下运作永远适合极权者但从历史可知，不久将来没有监管的区域没有法治的所在会不断膨胀，不只出现一些你要的东西如国际贸易，互联网，等等同时，也会出现些你不要的国际罪案，国际恐怖主义911 事件揭示即使你身在地球上最强势的国家城市里最具代表性的地标建筑不管怎样在九月某个明亮的早晨那些空间的人民一样能攻击你据说，经双子塔法团通过的4 百万元流动资金的当中约 60%是用来支助 911 事件的而双子塔就在 9/11 事件中被摧毁看，我们的敌人也会利用这些空间集体运输，互联网，卫星广播来解决他们的毒害不久，这会毁掉
en:Now that suits the powerfulup to a moment.It&#39;s always suitable for those who have the most powerto operate in spaces without constraint,but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later,unregulated space —space not subject to the rule of law —becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted —international trade, the Internet, etc. —but also by the things you don&#39;t want —international criminality, international terrorism.The revelation of 9/11is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth,nevertheless,those who inhabit that space can attack youeven in your most iconic of citiesone bright September morning.It&#39;s said that something like 60 percentof the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towerswhich 9/11 destroyed.You see, our enemies also use this space —the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters —to be able to get around their poison,which is about destroying our systems and our ways.

zh-cn:我们的系统我们的方式历史法则是权力走到那里管治便要跟到那里如果这是事实，那我相信今日社会的其中一个现象既是权力全球化那随之而来的挑战，便应是管治全球化我相信未来的几十年将会出现不同程度的骚乱多少能够成就这个目标将管治全球化
en:Sooner or later,sooner or later,the rule of historyis that where power goesgovernance must follow.And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is,that one of the phenomenon of our timeis the globalization of power,then it follows that one of the challenges of our timeis to bring governance to the global space.And I believe that the decades ahead of us nowwill be to a greater or lesser extent turbulentthe more or less we are able to achieve that aim:to bring governance to the global space.
时间： 5:55
zh-cn:要注意，我谈的不是政府也不是成立一些全球化的民主机构女士先生们, 顺道一提，我个人认为成立更多联合国类机构并不能把事办好如果我们没有这联合国，我们必需成立一个世界需要一个中介的国际论坛去合法化国际的联合行动但当涉及管治全球化时我估计通过更多的联合国类机构也没法达成当权力聚拢的时候才会真正出现建立一个以条约为基础的系统以条约为基础的协议来管治这国际舞台
en:Now notice, I&#39;m not talking about government.I&#39;m not talking about setting upsome global democratic institution.My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,is that this is unlikely to be doneby spawning more U.N. institutions.If we didn&#39;t have the U.N., we&#39;d have to invent it.The world needs an international forum.It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.But when it comes to governance of the global space,my guess is this won&#39;t happenthrough the creation of more U.N. institutions.It will actually happen by the powerful coming togetherand making treaty-based systems,treaty-based agreements,to govern that global space.
时间： 6:32
zh-cn:如你有留意，你会看见它正在发生，慢慢浮现世界贸易组织就是条约为本的组织完全以条约为本在必要时，他的现有势力己足以制衡强国如美国京都协议：努力成立一个条约为本的组织的开始G20 （20国集团）：现在我们知道我们要联合起来组织一个有能力管治国际金融间投机活动的机构这便是G20：一个条约为本的机构
en:And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.The World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization,entirely treaty-based,and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States,to account if necessary.Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to createa treaty-based organization.The G20:we know now that we have to put together an institutionwhich is capable of bringing governanceto that financial space for financial speculation.And that&#39;s what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.
时间： 7:01
zh-cn:现在，问题是，我们回头再谈这个如果你集中权力去建立一个条约为本的机构去填充管治空间那，那些没参加的弱国怎么办呢这可是大问题稍后再到回这话题
en:Now there&#39;s a problem there,and we&#39;ll come back to it in a minute,which is that if you bring the most powerful togetherto make the rules in treaty-based institutions,to fill that governance space,then what happens to the weak who are left out?And that&#39;s a big problem,and we&#39;ll return to it in just a second.
时间： 7:20
zh-cn:所以，我的第一要点是如果你身处这混乱年代不管混乱多还少要能成功克服很大程度取决于我们把合理的管理引进这国际舞台的能力并守护它出现我的第二要点是我知道我不必向你们说这种事但是，权力不单是纵向移动的它也横向移动
en:So there&#39;s my first message,that if you are to pass through these turbulent timesmore or less turbulently,then our success in doing thatwill in large measure depend on our capacityto bring sensible governanceto the global space.And watch that beginning to happen.My second point is,and I know I don&#39;t have to talk to an audience like thisabout such a thing,but power is not just shifting vertically,it&#39;s also shifting horizontally.

en:You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations,has been civilizations gathered around seas —with the first ones around the Mediterranean,the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.Well it seems to methat we&#39;re now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking,away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard]to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.Now that begins with economic power,but that&#39;s the way it always begins.You already begin to see the development of foreign policies,the augmentation of military budgetsoccurring in the other growing powers in the world.I think actuallythis is not so much a shift from the West to the East;something different is happening.

en:My guess is, for what it&#39;s worth,is that the United States will remainthe most powerful nation on earthfor the next 10 years, 15,but the context in which she holds her powerhas now radically altered; it has radically changed.We are coming out of 50 years,most unusual years, of historyin which we have had a totally mono-polar world,in which every compass needlefor or againsthas to be referenced by its position to Washington —a world bestrode by a single colossus.But that&#39;s not a usual case in history.In fact, what&#39;s now emergingis the much more normal case of history.You&#39;re beginning to see the emergenceof a multi-polar world.

en:Up until now,the United States has been the dominant feature of our world.They will remain the most powerful nation,but they will be the most powerful nationin an increasingly multi-polar world.And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up —in China, of course,though my own guess is that China&#39;s ascent to greatness is not smooth.It&#39;s going to be quite grumpyas China begins to democratize her societyafter liberalizing her economy.But that&#39;s a subject of a different discussion.You see India, you see Brazil.You see increasinglythat the world now looks actually, for us Europeans,much more like Europe in the 19th century.

en:Europe in the 19th century:a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning,used to describe it as the &quot;European concert of powers.&quot;There was a balance, a five-sided balance.Britain always played to the balance.If Paris got together with Berlin,Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.Now notice,in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world,you have fixed alliances —NATO, the Warsaw Pact.A fixed polarity of powermeans fixed alliances.But a multiple polarity of powermeans shifting and changing alliances.And that&#39;s the world we&#39;re coming into,in which we will increasingly seethat our alliances are not fixed.Canning, the great British foreign secretary once said,&quot;Britain has a common interest,but no common allies.&quot;And we will see increasinglythat even we in the Westwill reach out, have to reach out,beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powersto make alliances with othersif we want to get things done in the world.

en:Note, that when we went into Libya,it was not good enough for the West to do it alone;we had to bring others in.We had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last timeswhen the West has tried to do it themselves,and we haven&#39;t succeeded.My guessis that we&#39;re reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years —I say 400 years because it&#39;s the end of the Ottoman Empire —of the hegemony of Western power,Western institutions and Western values.You know, up until now, if the West got its act together,it could propose and disposein every corner of the world.But that&#39;s no longer true.Take the last financial crisisafter the Second World War.The West got together —the Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund —the problem solved.Now we have to call in others.Now we have to create the G20.Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circleof our Western friends.

en:Let me make a prediction for you,which is probably even more startling.I suspect we are now reaching the endof 400 yearswhen Western power was enough.People say to me, &quot;The Chinese, of course,they&#39;ll never get themselves involvedin peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world.&quot;Oh yes? Why not?How many Chinese troopsare serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag,serving under the U.N. command in the world today?3,700.How many Americans? 11.What is the largest naval contingenttackling the issue of Somali pirates?The Chinese naval contingent.Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.They want to keep the sea lanes open.Increasingly, we are going to have to do businesswith people with whom we do not share values,but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.It&#39;s a whole new different wayof looking at the world that is now emerging.

en:We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.And what that meansis the idea of a nation state acting alone,not connected with others,not working with others,is no longer a viable proposition.Because the actions of a nation stateare neither confined to itself,nor is it sufficient for the nation state itselfto control its own territory,because the effects outside the nation stateare now beginning to affect what happens inside them.

en:I was a young soldierin the last of the small empire wars of Britain.At that time, the defense of my countrywas about one thing and one thing only:how strong was our army, how strong was our air force,how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.That was when the enemy was outside the walls.Now the enemy is inside the walls.Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country,I have to speak to the Minister of Healthbecause pandemic disease is a threat to my security,I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculturebecause food security is a threat to my security,I have to speak to the Minister of Industrybecause the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructureis now a point of attack for our enemies —as we see from cyber warfare —I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairsbecause who has entered my country,who lives in that terraced house in that inner cityhas a direct effect on what happens in my country —as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.It&#39;s no longer the case that the security of a countryis simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.It&#39;s its capacity to lock together its institutions.
