zh-cn:在世界上发展中国家城市里流动性是一个非常严峻的挑战因为它和健康教育或住房不同当社会变得更富有时它反而变得更糟显然，是一个不可持续的发展模式流动性，如同其他大多数发展中国家所遇到的问题不仅仅是钱或科技的问题更是有关平等、 公平的问题发展中国家巨大的不平等让我们很难看到，例如在交通方面一个发达的城市不是连穷人都能使用汽车的地方而是甚至富有的人都去使用公共交通工具的地方像是自行车： 例如，在阿姆斯特丹超过 30% 的人口使用自行车尽管事实上，荷兰的人均收入已高过美国发展中国家城市内部也有矛盾为了钱，为了政府投资如果更多的钱投资在路政上那么投资在房屋学校， 医院，各方面的钱就会减少当然也有为了争夺空间的矛盾矛盾出现在那些有汽车和那些没有汽车的人之间今天我们大多数人接受私人财产和市场经济是管理大部分社会资源的最佳方式然而，随之而来的一个问题是市场经济需要通过收入不平等来鼓励人们工作有些人自然赚到更多的钱有些人赚的就较少一些一些公司获得成功，一些公司倒闭那么什么样的平等是我们今天在市场经济条件下所期待的？
en:Mobility in developing world citiesis a very peculiar challenge,because different from healthor education or housing,it tends to get worse as societies become richer.Clearly, a unsustainable model.Mobility, as most other developing country problems,more than a matter of money or technology,is a matter of equality, equity.The great inequality in developing countriesmakes it difficult to see, for example,that in terms of transport,an advanced city is not onewhere even the poor use cars,but rather one where even the richuse public transport.Or bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam,more than 30 percent of the populationuses bicycles,despite the fact that the Netherlands hasa higher income per capita than the United States.There is a conflict in developing world citiesfor money, for government investment.If more money is invested in highways,of course there is less money for housing,for schools, for hospitals,and also there is a conflict for space.There is a conflict for space betweenthose with cars and those without them.Most of us accept todaythat private property and a market economyis the best way to managemost of society&#39;s resources.However, there is a problem with that,that market economy needsinequality of income in order to work.Some people must make more money,some others less.Some companies succeed. Others fail.Then what kind of equalitycan we hope for todaywith a market economy?

zh-cn:我提出两种这两种都与城市有关第一种是生活质量的平等特别是对儿童来说所有儿童都应该拥有除了健康和教育条件外享受绿地，使用体育设施使用泳池， 接触音乐课程我所说的第二种平等我们称之为“民主权利平等”每个国家宪法的第一条规定都是所有公民在法律面前一律平等这不只是诗而是一个强有力的原则举例来说，如果这是真的载有 80 名乘客的巴士有权获得比单人驾驶的小汽车多 80 倍的道路空间
en:I would propose two kindswhich both have much to do with cities.The first one is equality of quality of life,especially for children,that all children should have,beyond the obvious health and education,access to green spaces, to sports facilities,to swimming pools, to music lessons.And the second kind of equalityis one which we could call &quot;democratic equality.&quot;The first article in every constitution statesthat all citizens are equal before the law.That is not just poetry.It&#39;s a very powerful principle.For example, if that is true,a bus with 80 passengershas a right to 80 times more road spacethan a car with one.

zh-cn:我们已经非常习惯于不平等，有时它就在面前，我们看不到它几十年前女性没有投票权好像是正常的事正如今天我们看到一辆公共汽车处在拥挤的道路中事实上，当我成为市长的时候运用这一民主原则即公众利益高于私人利益当一辆巴士载有 100 人就有权获得比一辆小车多 100 倍的道路空间我们实施了一个大运量客运系统基于公交专用车道我们为它命名“穿越千禧”为了让巴士更性感还有一个非常漂亮的民主符号是当巴士飞驰而过而昂贵的豪华轿车被堵在路上很明显，这就是民主得到实现的画面事实上，它不仅仅是公平问题不需要博士一组 12 岁的儿童就能在 20 分钟内找出使用有限道路空间的最有效方法是设立公交车专用车道事实上，公共汽车并不性感但它们是唯一可能在快速发展的发展型城市提供大量客运的交通工具它们有很大的容量例如，这系统在广州比中国所有的地铁线路能运送更多的乘客除了北京的一条地铁线且成本只是地铁的一小部分
en:We have been so used to inequality, sometimes,that it&#39;s before our noses and we do not see it.Less than 100 years ago,women could not vote,and it seemed normal,in the same way that it seems normal todayto see a bus in traffic.In fact, when I became mayor,applying that democratic principlethat public good prevails over private interest,that a bus with 100 peoplehas a right to 100 timesmore road space than a car,we implemented a mass transit systembased on buses in exclusive lanes.We called it TransMilenio,in order to make buses sexier.And one thing is that it is also a very beautifuldemocratic symbol, because as buses zoom by,expensive cars stuck in traffic,it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work.In fact, it&#39;s not just a matter of equity.It doesn&#39;t take Ph.D.&#39;s.A committee of 12-year-old childrenwould find out in 20 minutesthat the most efficient way to use scarce road spaceis with exclusive lanes for buses.In fact, buses are not sexy,but they are the only possible meansto bring mass transit to all areasof fast growing developing cities.They also have great capacity.For example, this system in Guangzhouis moving more passengers our directionthan all subway lines in China,except for one line in Beijing,at a fraction of the cost.

zh-cn:我们不只是为巴士争取空间我们也为人们争取空间那是更加困难的事城市是人类栖息地我们人类是喜欢行走的就像鱼需要游泳或鸟需要飞或鹿需要奔跑，我们需要行走真的有非常巨大的矛盾当我们谈论发展中国家的城市行人与汽车的关系在这里，你看到的是一张显示不够民主的图片这表明的是，行人是三等公民而那些开车的则是一等公民从交通基础设施方面看什么是真正区别先进和落后的城市之间的不是高速公路或地铁而是有无适宜的人行道这里，他们建造了一座天桥，可能非常无用而且，他们忘了修建人行道这样的现象在世界各地普遍存在甚至在校学童都没有汽车重要
en:We fought not just for space for buses,but we fought for space for people,and that was even more difficult.Cities are human habitats,and we humans are pedestrians.Just as fish need to swim or birds need to flyor deer need to run, we need to walk.There is a really enormous conflict,when we are talking about developing country cities,between pedestrians and cars.Here, what you see is a picture that showsinsufficient democracy.What this shows is that people who walkare third-class citizenswhile those who go in carsare first-class citizens.In terms of transport infrastructure,what really makes a differencebetween advanced and backward citiesis not highways or subwaysbut quality sidewalks.Here they made a flyover, probably very useless,and they forgot to make a sidewalk.This is prevailing all over the world.Not even schoolchildrenare more important than cars.

zh-cn:在我的城市波哥大我们打了一场非常困难的战斗来为人们争取更多的空间为了夺回汽车所占有的空间有些车几十年来停放在人行道上这夺回的空间反映的是人类的尊严并且，使空间保护里的自行车道首先，在那之前我满头黑发（笑声）过程中，我几乎遭到弹劾这是场非常艰难的战斗然而，我们成功了，最终艰苦的战斗结束后让一座城市对人类尊严有些许尊重以证明那些行人和那些有车的人同等重要事实上，任何地方最重要的意识形态和政治纷争就是如何分配城市最宝贵的资源就是道路空间一个城市能在地下能找到石油或钻石那也没有道路空间更为宝贵如何将它分配给行人自行车、公共交通和汽车呢？这不是一个技术问题当我们分配道路资源的时候我们应该记住，没有任何一部宪法没有任何一部宪法表明停车是一项宪法权利
en:In my city of Bogotá,we fought a very difficult battlein order to take space from cars,which had been parking on sidewalks for decades,in order to make space for people that should reflectdignity of human beings,and to make space for protected bikeways.First of all, I had black hair before that.(Laughter)And I was almost impeached in the process.It is a very difficult battle.However, it was possible, finally,after very difficult battles, to make a citythat would reflect some respect for human dignity,that would show that those who walk are equallyimportant to those who have cars.Indeed, a very important ideologicaland political issue anywhereis how to distribute that most valuable resourceof a city, which is road space.A city could find oil or diamonds undergroundand it would not be so valuable as road space.How to distribute it between pedestrians,bicycles, public transport and cars?This is not a technological issue,and we should remember that in no constitutionparking is a constitutional rightwhen we make that distribution.

zh-cn:我们还建造了，这是 15 年前在纽约，巴黎，或者伦敦有自行车道之前那也是场非常困难的斗争保护 350 公里以上的自行车道我不认为自行车道是一个可爱的建筑特征它是一种权利，正如人行道一样除非我们认为，只有那些能使用机动车辆的人才有权安全地流动不用受到致命的危险正如巴士专用道自行车道也是民主的一个强有力的象征因为它们表明骑价值 30 美金自行车的公民和一个驾驶3 万美元汽车的公民同等重要
en:We also built, and this was 15 years ago,before there were bikeways in New Yorkor in Paris or in London,it was a very difficult battle as well,more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.I don&#39;t think protected bicycle waysare a cute architectural feature.They are a right, just as sidewalks are,unless we believe that only thosewith access to a motor vehiclehave a right to safe mobility,without the risk of getting killed.And just as busways are,protected bikeways also area powerful symbol of democracy,because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycleis equally importantto one in a $30,000 car.

zh-cn:我们生活在一个特殊历史时刻在未来的 50 年，我们所建造的城市一半以上，在 2060 年的时候，仍会存在许多发展中国家其中超过百分之八九十到 2060 年仍会存在的城市将在未来的四五十年间建立起来
en:And we are living in a unique moment in history.In the next 50 years, more than half of those citieswhich will exist in the year 2060 will be built.In many developing country cities,more than 80 and 90 percentof the city which will exist in 2060will be built over the next four or five decades.

zh-cn:但这不只是发展中国家的城市在美国，例如超过 7000 万的新房必须在接下来的四五十年间建造完成其数量相当于今天英国、法国和加拿大所有的房子加在一起我相信今天我们的城市有严重缺陷不同的更好的那种房屋会被建造起来
en:But this is not just a matterfor developing country cities.In the United States, for example,more than 70 million new homesmust be built over the next 40 or 50 years.That&#39;s more than all the homes that today existin Britain, France and Canada put together.And I believe that our cities todayhave severe flaws,and that different, better ones could be built.

zh-cn:今天我们的城市哪里有问题呢？好吧，例如，如果我们告诉任何三岁孩童这些儿童还不怎么会讲话在今天世界上的任何城市&quot;小心，有车&quot;孩子会受惊吓跳起来很好解释，因为全世界每年有超过一万名儿童死于汽车造成的交通事故城市的历史长达 8000 年儿童可以走出家，去玩儿事实上，只是在最近直到 1900 年，是没有汽车的汽车的存在不到 100 年但它们完全改变了城市在 1900 年，例如美国死于车祸的人数为零仅仅 20 年后1920 年至 1930 年间近 20 万人在美国死于车祸在 1925 年，近 7000 名儿童在美国死于车祸所以我们可以创建不一样的城市创建那种适合人类生活而不是汽车的城市将更多的公共空间给予人类而不是汽车的城市那些对最容易受到伤害的公民比如孩子或者长者给予极大尊重的城市
en:What is wrong with our cities today?Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old childwho is barely learning to speakin any city in the world today,&quot;Watch out, a car,&quot;the child will jump in fright,and with a very good reason, because there aremore than 10,000 children who are killedby cars every year in the world.We have had cities for 8,000 years,and children could walk out of home and play.In fact, only very recently,towards 1900, there were no cars.Cars have been here for reallyless than 100 years.They completely changed cities.In 1900, for example,nobody was killed by cars in the United States.Only 20 years later,between 1920 and 1930,almost 200,000 peoplewere killed by cars in the United States.Only in 1925, almost 7,000 childrenwere killed by cars in the United States.So we could make different cities,cities that will give more priority to human beingsthan to cars, that will give more public spaceto human beings than to cars,cities which show great respectfor those most vulnerable citizens,such as children or the elderly.

zh-cn:我接下来的提案将包含几项我认为将使城市变得更好的措施在新建城市中非常简单易行非常简单易行数百公里的绿色街道纵横交错于城市中儿童将可以走出家门，外面也同样安全他们可以安全地在数十公里美好的绿色廊道类似自行车公路的地方自由活动我想邀请你来想象一下以下画面：一座城市，每条街道将只是人行道和自行车道在即将建造的新城市中做到这点并不是特别困难当我担任波哥大市长的时候仅三年，我们就建造了70 公里而且是在世界上人口最稠密的城市之一70 公里的自行车公路这改变了人们的生活出行和享受城市的方式在这张图片里，你可以看到在一个非常贫穷的社区我们有豪华的自行车行人专用道而汽车仍行驶在土地上当然，我很乐意铺好这条街的机动车道但我们首先做的是什么呢？在这个街区，99% 的人没有车但你看，一座城市只被创建时很容易将这种基础设施纳入规划然后城市的其他设施在这附近建立起来当然这是只是惊鸿一瞥可以带来更好的生活我们只是创建它它就改变了我们的生活方式
en:I will propose to you a couple of ingredientswhich I think would make cities much better,and it would be very simple to implement themin the new cities which are only being created.Hundreds of kilometers of greenwayscriss-crossing cities in all directions.Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces.They could go for dozens of kilometers safelywithout any risk in wonderful greenways,sort of bicycle highways,and I would invite you to imagine the following:a city in which every other street would bea street only for pedestrians and bicycles.In new cities which are going to be built,this would not be particularly difficult.When I was mayor of Bogotá,in only three years, we were able to create70 kilometers,in one of the most dense cities in the world,of these bicycle highways.And this changes the way people live,move, enjoy the city.In this picture, you see in oneof the very poor neighborhoods,we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street,and the cars still in the mud.Of course, I would love to pave this street for cars.But what do we do first?Ninety-nine percent of the peoplein those neighborhoods don&#39;t have cars.But you see, when a city is only being created,it&#39;s very easy to incorporatethis kind of infrastructure.Then the city grows around it.And of course this is just a glimpseof something which could be much betterif we just create it,and it changes the way of life.

zh-cn:第二要素将解决流动性的问题在发展中国家，这非常艰难的挑战一个成本非常低且简单易行的方法是将数百公里的道路打造成专用道，巴士专用道公交车专用道、自行车专用道和人行道这将是一个成本十分低廉的解决方案如果从头开始实施成本低，带来令人愉快的转变享受自然阳光
en:And the second ingredient,which would solve mobility,that very difficult challenge in developing countries,in a very low-cost and simple way,would be to have hundreds of kilometersof streets only for buses,buses and bicycles and pedestrians.This would be, again, a very low-cost solutionif implemented from the start,low cost, pleasant transitwith natural sunlight.

zh-cn:但不幸的是，现实和我梦想的不一样由于土地的私有权和高价格因素所有发展中国家的城市都有贫民窟这个难题在我生活的国家哥伦比亚城市中几乎一半的房屋是在城市修建之初的违建当然这就为使用公共交通或使用自行车带来了诸多不便不过，即使是符合法律的发展也发展在了错误的地方像是离市中心很远的地方在那里是不可能提供低成本、高效率的公共交通的作为一个拉丁美洲国家拉丁美洲是世界上近年来按秩序发展的区域我恭敬地，充满激情地建议这些尚有待于城市化的国家 —拉丁美洲去的城市化从 1950 年的 40%增长到 2010 年的 80% —我建议亚洲国家和非洲国家那些仍未城市化的地方比如印度，印度城市化目前只有 33%当地政府应掌握城市周围的所有土地这样，这些城市才会合理发展建有公园绿色街道，公交车道
en:But unfortunately, reality is not as goodas my dreams.Because of private property of landand high land prices,all developing country citieshave a large problem of slums.In my country of Colombia, almost half the homesin cities initially were illegal developments.And of course it&#39;s very difficult to havemass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.But even legal developmentshave also been located in the wrong places,very far from the city centerswhere it&#39;s impossible to providelow-cost, high-frequency public transport.As a Latin American, and Latin Americawas the most recently organized region in the world,I would recommend, respectfully, passionately,to those countries which are yet to urbanize —Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950to 80 percent urban in 2010 —I would recommend Asian and African countrieswhich are yet to urbanize,such as India which is only 33 percent urban now,that governments should acquireall land around cities.In this way, their cities could grow in the right placeswith the right spaces, with the parks,with the greenways, with the busways.

zh-cn:未来 50 年我们要建的城市将决定未来数十亿人民的生活质量，甚至幸福感这对许多领导人和年轻领袖是绝好的机会特别是对那些在发展中国家的来说他们可以为未来数十亿人民带来更加幸福快乐的生活我坚信这点，我很乐观他们将使城市比我们所期望的更好
en:The cities we are going to buildover the next 50 yearswill determine quality of life and even happinessfor billions of people towards the future.What a fantastic opportunity for leadersand many young leaders to come,especially in the developing countries.They can create a much happier lifefor billions towards the future.I am sure, I am optimistic,that they will make cities betterthan our most ambitious dreams.
