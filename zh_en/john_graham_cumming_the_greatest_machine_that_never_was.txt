zh-cn:我马上要给你们介绍的机器呢是被我称之为有史以来最伟大的机器它是一个从来没有被制造出来的机器不过呢,它将来会被造出来的它是一个早在人们对电脑没有概念的时候设计出来的一种机器
en:So the machine I&#39;m going to talk you aboutis what I call the greatest machine that never was.It was a machine that was never built,and yet, it will be built.It was a machine that was designedlong before anyone thought about computers.

zh-cn:如果你对电脑的历史有一些了解的话你知道在30和40年代的时候,出现了一些简单的电脑标志着我们今天所看到的电脑革命的开端你这样想是对的不过你把世纪搞错了第一台电脑其实是在19世纪30,40年代设计的,而不是20世纪的30,40年代它的设计和一部分原型还有部分制造都发生在这里南肯辛顿
en:If you know anything about the history of computers,you will know that in the &#39;30s and the &#39;40s,simple computers were createdthat started the computer revolution we have today,and you would be correct,except for you&#39;d have the wrong century.The first computer was really designedin the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.It was designed, and parts of it were prototyped,and the bits of it that were built are herein South Kensington.

zh-cn:这台机器是这个叫查尔斯·巴贝奇的人建造出来的我这个人对查尔斯·巴贝奇有种清切感因为他所有照片里的头发都乱成这个样.他非常的富有而且可以说是英国的贵族成员在马斯伯恩的一个周六的晚上假如你是当时的一名知识分子你会被邀请到他的房子去一个社交晚会—他会邀请每一个人国王,惠灵顿的公爵,很多很多有名的人—-然后他就会给你们看他的一个机械
en:That machine was built by this guy, Charles Babbage.Now, I have a great affinity for Charles Babbagebecause his hair is always completely unkempt like thisin every single picture. (Laughter)He was a very wealthy man, and a sort of,part of the aristocracy of Britain,and on a Saturday night in Marylebone,were you part of the intelligentsia of that period,you would have been invited round to his housefor a soiree — and he invited everybody:kings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people —and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines.

zh-cn:我非常想念那个时代,那时候你可以去一个社交晚会，然后看到一台机械电脑的演示. (笑声)不过巴贝奇是在18世纪末出生的还是个比较有名的数学家他担当了当时牛顿在剑桥的职位最近又由史蒂芬霍金担当他没这些人那么有名,因为他只有创造这台机器的想法但却从未真正制造出来
en:I really miss that era, you know, where you couldgo around for a soiree and see a mechanical computerget demonstrated to you. (Laughter)But Babbage, Babbage himself was bornat the end of the 18th century,and was a fairly famous mathematician.He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge,and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.He&#39;s less well known than either of them becausehe got this idea to make mechanical computing devicesand never made any of them.
时间： 1:45
zh-cn:原因就是他是个典型的书呆子每回他有一个很好的想法他就会想,&quot;太棒了,我准备去把它造出来.我会投入一大笔钱。但我又有个更好的主意那我就造这个吧.(笑声) 不对,我应该造这个.&quot;他一直都是这么干,直到罗伯特·皮尔（后来成为首相）把他从唐宁街10号开除当时开除就意会着对他说祝你有个愉快的一天.(笑声)
en:The reason he never made any of them, he&#39;s a classic nerd.Every time he had a good idea, he&#39;d think,&quot;That&#39;s brilliant, I&#39;m going to start building that one.I&#39;ll spend a fortune on it. I&#39;ve got a better idea.I&#39;m going to work on this one. (Laughter) And I&#39;m going to do this one.&quot;He did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister,basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street,and kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying,&quot;I bid you good day, sir.&quot; (Laughter)

zh-cn:他设计的东西就是这个巨大的玩意儿,分析引擎.现在为了让你解释一下这是一个俯视图每个圈圈都是一个齿轮,一叠齿轮因此这东西就跟一个蒸汽火车头一样大在我说的时候,我想让你想象一下这个巨大的机器.我们可以听到这些由这个机器发出的美妙的声音现在呢我准备给你介绍一下机器的构造这就是为什么这是电脑的构造然后告诉你这台机器其实是个电脑
en:The thing he designed was this monstrosity here,the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this,this is a view from above.Every one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs,and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.So as I go through this talk, I want you to imaginethis gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful soundsof what this thing would have sounded like.And I&#39;m going to take you through the architecture of the machine— that&#39;s why it&#39;s computer architecture —and tell you about this machine, which is a computer.
时间： 2:34
zh-cn:我们先讨论下内存它的内存就跟现在的电脑一样只不过它当时是用金属做的一叠又一叠的齿轮,有30个齿轮那么高想象一下这个高度有几百个那么多然后它们上面都有编号这个机器是个十进制的.所有东西都是十进制他想过用二进制.不过问题是那样的话机器会高得离谱而且还会变得极其巨大所以它是有内存的这部分就是它的内存它们都是这个样子
en:So let&#39;s talk about the memory. The memoryis very like the memory of a computer today,except it was all made out of metal,stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.Imagine a thing this high of cogs,hundreds and hundreds of them,and they&#39;ve got numbers on them.It&#39;s a decimal machine. Everything&#39;s done in decimal.And he thought about using binary. The problemwith using binary is that the machine would have been sotall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it&#39;s enormous.So he&#39;s got memory.The memory is this bit over here.You see it all like this.
时间： 3:07
zh-cn:这个巨大的东西就是CPU（中央处理器）或者说是芯片没错,就这么大完全是机械化.整个机器都是如此这是一张展示CPU的一部分的原型照片来自科学博物馆
en:This monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.Of course, it&#39;s this big.Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical.This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPUwhich is in the Science Museum.
时间： 3:23
zh-cn:CPU可以做4种基本的运算加减乘除这对于金属来说已经很不错了不过它还可以做一些电脑能做的事情但是计算器做不了的这个机器可以通过内存的数据来做决定它可以为程序员做条件判断而这样一来它其实就成了一台电脑可以计算.不光是计算,还可以做更多
en:The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic —so addition, multiplication, subtraction, division —which already is a bit of a feat in metal,but it could also do something that a computer doesand a calculator doesn&#39;t:this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.It could do the &quot;if then&quot; for basic programmers,and that fundamentally made it into a computer.It could compute. It couldn&#39;t just calculate. It could do more.
时间： 3:50
zh-cn:现在,让我们看着这个，停下来想想我们当今的芯片,我们甚至都看不到里面是什么.实在太小了不过你如果真看到了,你可以看到跟这个（机械电脑）很相似的东西这就是CPU里难以置信的复杂性以及内存中难以置信的规律性如果你曾经看到一个电子显微镜的照片你就会看到这个.看起来都会是一样的然后这部分就会十分的复杂
en:Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute,and we think about chips today, we can&#39;tlook inside a silicon chip. It&#39;s just so tiny.Yet if you did, you would see somethingvery, very similar to this.There&#39;s this incredible complexity in the CPU,and this incredible regularity in the memory.If you&#39;ve ever seen an electron microscope picture,you&#39;ll see this. This all looks the same,then there&#39;s this bit over here which is incredibly complicated.
时间： 4:14
zh-cn:所有这些齿轮运作都在做一个电脑所做的事情不过当然你得给这个编程,巴贝奇当时使用了一种将在20世纪50,60,70年代又会重新出现的技术那就是打孔卡片.这个东西就是三个中其中一个读卡机而这是一个在科学博物馆里的程序离这儿不远,是由巴贝奇写的就在那儿,你可以去看看然后等待人们把机器制造出来不过那其实还有好多他设计了一些程序,期待着它可以实现
en:All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does,but of course you need to program this thing, and of course,Babbage used the technology of the dayand the technology that would reappear in the &#39;50s, &#39;60s and &#39;70s,which is punch cards. This thing over hereis one of three punch card readers in here,and this is a program in the Science Museum, justnot far from here, created by Charles Babbage,that is sitting there — you can go see it —waiting for the machine to be built.And there&#39;s not just one of these, there&#39;s many of them.He prepared programs anticipating this would happen.
时间： 4:51
zh-cn:之所以用那么多打孔卡片是因为有提花机法国创造了提花机受打孔卡片所控制，可以织出这些的不可思议的图案而他当时就在为今天的科技在准备跟所有他所做的其他事情一样他在用他当时19世纪30,40,50年代的科技,齿轮,蒸汽机器什么的具有讽刺意味的是,跟他在同一年出生的还有迈克尔 法拉第法拉第最后彻底地将所有东西都改进了通过发电机,变压器以及各种东西巴贝奇想要用久经考验的科技因此就是蒸汽之类的东西
en:Now, the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard,in France, had created the Jacquard loom,which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards,so he was just repurposing the technology of the day,and like everything else he did, he&#39;s using the technologyof his era, so 1830s, 1840s, 1850s, cogs, steam,mechanical devices. Ironically, born the same yearas Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday,who would completely revolutionize everythingwith the dynamo, transformers, all these sorts of things.Babbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology,so steam and things.
时间： 5:24
zh-cn:他需要一些配件显然你已经有个电脑了还有很多卡片,CPU,以及内存你还是需要一些配件没有的那些配件
en:Now, he needed accessories.Obviously, you&#39;ve got a computer now.You&#39;ve got punch cards, a CPU and memory.You need accessories you&#39;re going to come with.You&#39;re not just going to have that,
时间： 5:33
zh-cn:首先呢，要有声音。你可以用个铃铛如果有事情出错了的话——(笑声)或者机器需要一个人工干预的时候就可以摇铃铛.(笑声)在打孔卡片上实际有个说明上面写着:&quot;摇铃铛.&quot;然后你就可以想象&quot;叮!&quot;的一声你可以想象一下所有这些噪音这玩意儿,咔嗒咔嚓咔嗒咔嚓还有蒸汽引擎.&quot;叮,&quot;没错吧?(笑声)
en:So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell,so if anything went wrong — (Laughter) —or the machine needed the attendant to come to it,there was a bell it could ring. (Laughter)And there&#39;s actually an instruction on the punch cardwhich says &quot;Ring the bell.&quot; So you can imagine this &quot;Ting!&quot;You know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises,this thing, &quot;Click, clack click click click,&quot;steam engine, &quot;Ding,&quot; right? (Laughter)
时间： 5:53
zh-cn:你还需要一个打印机,当然,每个人都需要这是一幅关于另外一个机器的打印原理的图片名叫“差分机2号”他从没建造出来,不过科学博物馆在80和90年代造出来了还是个纯机械打印机它只打印数字,因为他对数字很着迷不过它可以在纸上打印,甚至可以自动换行因此当你到了一行的最后时,就会自动换行
en:You also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer.This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism foranother machine of his, called the Difference Engine No. 2,which he never built, but which the Science Museumdid build in the &#39;80s and &#39;90s.It&#39;s completely mechanical, again, a printer.It prints just numbers, because he was obsessed with numbers,but it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping,so if you get to the end of the line, it goes around like that.
时间： 6:16
zh-cn:你还需要图像,对吧?如果你要对图像做点什么的话因此他说:&quot;嗯..我需要个绘图机,我有一大张纸,还有个钢笔,这样它就可以作图了.&quot;因此他也设计了一个绘图机在那个时候呢,他拥有一个很好的机器了
en:You also need graphics, right?I mean, if you&#39;re going to do anything with graphics,so he said, &quot;Well, I need a plotter. I&#39;ve got a big piece of paperand an ink pen and I&#39;ll make it plot.&quot;So he designed a plotter as well,and, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty mucha pretty good machine.
时间： 6:31
zh-cn:当然还有这个女人,艾达 勒夫蕾丝现在,想象一下这样的社交聚会,所有这样有名利的人都来了这位女士就是疯狂,阴险和危险的拜伦王的女儿她妈担心她的女儿会继承一些她爸的疯狂和阴险她想到:&quot;我知道怎么解决了.数学就可以解决.我们会教她数学.这样她就安静下来了.&quot;(笑声)因为从来没有一个数学家最后给疯掉的因此呢,那个主意还不错.(笑声)一切都会变好的.因此她开始了对数学的学习然后跟她妈妈去了一个社交聚会然后巴贝奇拿出了他的机器威灵顿的公爵在那儿呢,巴贝奇示范了他的机器,然后艾达就理解了.她是在他一生中的唯一个人,真正能理解的她说:&quot;我知道这个机器是干嘛的我也理解这个机器的未来会怎么样.&quot;她对我们的帮助十分大，因为之所以很多巴贝奇想要制造的机器都是因为她
en:Along comes this woman, Ada Lovelace.Now, imagine these soirees, all these great and good comes along.This lady is the daughter of the mad, badand dangerous-to-know Lord Byron,and her mother, being a bit worried that she might haveinherited some of Lord Byron&#39;s madness and badness,thought, &quot;I know the solution: Mathematics is the solution.We&#39;ll teach her mathematics. That&#39;ll calm her down.&quot;(Laughter) Because of course,there&#39;s never been a mathematician that&#39;s gone crazy,so, you know, that&#39;ll be fine. (Laughter)Everything&#39;ll be fine. So she&#39;s got this mathematical training,and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother,and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.The Duke of Wellington is there, you know,get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it,and she gets it. She&#39;s the only person in his lifetime, really,who said, &quot;I understand what this does,and I understand the future of this machine.&quot;And we owe to her an enormous amount because we knowa lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to buildbecause of her.
时间： 7:31
zh-cn:现在呢,一些人把她叫第一个程序员这其实是从她当初翻译的文章得出来的这是一个特定格式下的程序不过历史上讲,她并不仅仅真正的第一个程序员实际上,她做了一些更惊人的事不光是一个编程员她还看到了一些巴贝奇没有看到的东西
en:Now, some people call her the first programmer.This is actually from one of — the paper that she translated.This is a program written in a particular style.It&#39;s not, historically, totally accurate that she&#39;s the first programmer,and actually, she did something more amazing.Rather than just being a programmer,she saw something that Babbage didn&#39;t.
时间： 7:50
zh-cn:他对数学太着迷了他想建造一个能做数学的机器然后勒夫蕾丝说:&quot;你在这台机器上不光可以做数学.&quot;其实在这个房间里都每一个人身上都有个电脑因为他们都有手机如果你打开你的手机，上面的每个东西或者电脑，或者其他任何计算设备那都是数学.在底下全部都是数字不管是视频或者短信或者音乐,都是数字从头到尾都是数学函数勒夫蕾丝说:&quot;仅仅因为你在使用数学函数和符号并不代表这些东西不能呈现其他东西,比如说音乐.&quot;这是个巨大的飞跃,因为巴贝奇说&quot;我们可以计算出这些神奇的函数然后把数学表格和图像打印出来.&quot;—-(笑声)然而勒夫蕾丝则说:&quot;你看,只要你给它以数字的形式呈现音乐它就可以用来作曲.&quot;这就是我说的勒夫蕾丝的飞越当你说她是个程序员的时候,她的确是不过真正的重要是说出了未来会为变成什么样这比作为第一个程序员要有价值多了
en:Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics.He was building a machine to do mathematics,and Lovelace said, &quot;You could do more than mathematicson this machine.&quot; And just as you do,everyone in this room already&#39;s got a computer on themright now, because they&#39;ve got a phone.If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phoneor computer or any other computing deviceis mathematics. It&#39;s all numbers at the bottom.Whether it&#39;s video or text or music or voice, it&#39;s all numbers,it&#39;s all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening,and Lovelace said, &quot;Just because you&#39;re doingmathematical functions and symbolsdoesn&#39;t mean these things can&#39;t representother things in the real world, such as music.&quot;This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying,&quot;We could compute these amazing functions and print outtables of numbers and draw graphs,&quot; — (Laughter) —and Lovelace is there and she says, &quot;Look,this thing could even compose music if youtold it a representation of music numerically.&quot;So this is what I call Lovelace&#39;s Leap.When you say she&#39;s a programmer, she did do some,but the real thing is to have said the future is going to bemuch, much more than this.

zh-cn:现在,一百多年后,有个人出现了艾兰图林。在1936年,他重新发明了电脑当然,巴贝奇的机器是纯机械的图林的机器是纯理论的这些人都是从数学角度的观点来考虑的不过图林告诉我们一些很重要的事情他在计算机科学奠定了数学的基础他说“你怎么制造电脑并不重要.&quot;就像是机械电脑，像巴贝奇那种，或者电子的，跟今天一样的，也不重要再抑或将来是细胞构成的，或者又是机械的,一旦我们进入纳米技术我们可以回到巴贝奇的机器，使它变得很小。所有这些东西都是计算机在这之中有一个计算的本质这叫做邱奇-图灵论题
en:Now, a hundred years later, this guy comes along,Alan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again.Now, of course, Babbage&#39;s machine was entirely mechanical.Turing&#39;s machine was entirely theoretical.Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective,but Turing told us something very important.He laid down the mathematical foundationsfor computer science, and said,&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter how you make a computer.&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if your computer&#39;s mechanical,like Babbage&#39;s was, or electronic, like computers are today,or perhaps in the future, cells, or, again,mechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.We could go back to Babbage&#39;s machineand just make it tiny. All those things are computers.There is in a sense a computing essence.This is called the Church–Turing thesis.
时间： 9:46
zh-cn:所以突然之间,你知道了其中的联系巴贝奇当年造的那东西确实是台电脑实际上,它可以做任何我们现在用电脑能做的事情,只不过极其的慢而已.(笑声)你要是想知道多慢的话,它有1k的内存它使用打孔卡片作为输入比第一个ZX81（1981生产的家用电脑）要慢1万倍不过呢,它的确有个RAM组你可以扩大它的容量
en:And so suddenly, you get this link where you saythis thing Babbage had built really was a computer.In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do todaywith computers, only really slowly. (Laughter)To give you an idea of how slowly,it had about 1k of memory.It used punch cards, which were being fed in,and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.It did have a RAM pack.You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to.
时间：10:18
zh-cn:(笑声)嗯,那么这个东西给我们今天带来什么呢?我们有计划在斯文顿的科学博物馆档案中有成百个计划和上千页巴贝奇写的关于这个分析引擎的笔记其中一个我们把它叫“计划28”这还是个我与多伦斯韦德（Doron Swade）创建的一个慈善机构的名字,他是科学博物馆计算项目的管理人,并且是他将起草了建造差分机的计划我们的计划就是把它造出来在这里南肯辛顿,我们还会造分析引擎
en:(Laughter) So, where does that bring us today?So there are plans.Over in Swindon, the Science Museum archives,there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pagesof notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28,and that is also the name of a charity that I startedwith Doron Swade, who was the curator of computingat the Science Museum, and also the person who drovethe project to build a difference engine,and our plan is to build it.Here in South Kensington, we will build the analytical engine.
时间：10:49
zh-cn:这个工程有很多部分一部分就是扫描巴贝奇的档案这个已经做完了.第二个是现在学习所有这些计划去决定应该建造什么第三部分是那个机器的一个电脑模拟系统最后一部就是在科学博物馆真正把机器造出来
en:The project has a number of parts to it.One was the scanning of Babbage&#39;s archive.That&#39;s been done. The second is now the studyof all of those plans to determine what to build.The third part is a computer simulation of that machine,and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.
时间：11:06
zh-cn:当它造出来的时候,你就会真正理解电脑是怎么工作的因为与其有一个极小的芯片在你面前你可以看看这个巨大的东西然后说;&quot;噢,我看到内存在工作,CPU在工作我还能听见它在工作.我说不定还闻到了.&quot;(笑声)在这之间呢我们会做一个模拟
en:When it&#39;s built, you&#39;ll finally be able to understand how a computer works,because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you,you&#39;ve got to look at this humongous thing and say, &quot;Ah,I see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating,I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating.&quot; (Laughter)But in between that we&#39;re going to do a simulation.
时间：11:23
zh-cn:巴贝奇写到一旦分析引擎存在后它一定会对于未来的科学有所指导作用当然,他从未成功造出来,因为他总是在他新计划上浪费时间,不过当真有东西建造出来的时候,在20世纪40年代,所有事情都被改变了
en:Babbage himself wrote, he said,as soon as the analytical engine exists,it will surely guide the future course of science.Of course, he never built it, because he was always fiddlingwith new plans, but when it did get built, of course,in the 1940s, everything changed.
时间：11:38
zh-cn:现在,我会给你看下它大概会长成什么样子一个视频来展示CPU的一部分是怎么工作的这是三组齿轮它准备做加法.这是加法的工作原理这样你可以想象到这个巨大的机器
en:Now, I&#39;ll just give you a little taste of what it looks likein motion with a video which showsjust one part of the CPU mechanism working.So this is just three sets of cogs,and it&#39;s going to add. This is the adding mechanismin action, so you imagine this gigantic machine.
