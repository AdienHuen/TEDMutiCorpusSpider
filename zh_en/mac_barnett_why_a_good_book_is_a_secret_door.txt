zh-cn:我创作儿童文学巴勃罗·毕加索曾有一句名言“我们都知道艺术并非真理艺术是能使我们意识到真理的谎言或者至少使我们意识到我们能认同的真理艺术家必须懂得一些方法来使人们信服他谎言中的真实”
en:I write children&#39;s books,and there&#39;s a quote from Pablo Picasso,&quot;We all know that Art is not truth.Art is a lie that makes us realize truthor at least the truth that is given us to understand.The artist must know the manner wherebyto convince others of the truthfulness of his lies.&quot;

zh-cn:第一次听到这话的时候，我还是个小孩那时就很喜欢这个说法但是我不知道他说的是啥意思（笑声）
en:I first heard this when I was a kid,and I loved it,but I had no idea what it meant.(Laughter)

zh-cn:你知道吗，这是我今天要讲的真理与谎言虚构与现实那我到底该如何理解这段令人匪夷所思的话呢不如用 PowerPoint 来做个文氏图吧［“真实” “谎言”］（笑声）就是这个，很棒吧？有真实和谎言两部分还有两个边缘交界那个中间的地方那就是艺术嗯，文氏图（笑声）（掌声）
en:So I thought, you know what, it&#39;s what I&#39;m hereto talk to you today about, though,truth and lies, fiction and reality.So how could I untanglethis knotted bunch of sentences?And I said, I&#39;ve got PowerPoint.Let&#39;s do a Venn diagram.[&quot;Truth. Lies.&quot;](Laughter)So there it is, right there, boom.We&#39;ve got truth and liesand then there&#39;s this little space,the edge, in the middle.That liminal space, that&#39;s art.All right. Venn diagram. (Laughter) (Applause)

zh-cn:但是这好像也不是很有用使我理解这段话的以及真正使我对艺术——或者至少是小说的艺术有所理解的就是为孩子们工作的时候我曾是夏令营的指导老师我在大学暑假时担任这种工作也很喜爱这个工作那是一个为4到6岁的孩子们举办的运动夏令营我负责带领四岁的孩子那很棒，因为四岁的孩子还不会运动正巧我也不会（笑声）我就搞四岁小孩儿级别的运动实际情况就是孩子们绕着交通锥运球玩得大汗淋漓然后他们去树下面休息结果我早就在那儿坐着了—（笑声）—我会编故事讲给他们听也会给他们编造关于我的故事我告诉他们，我周末回到家以后为英国女王做秘密侦查很快，其他有些不在我组里的孩子也会到我这儿来，然后说“你就是麦克·巴耐特，对吧？那个暗中为英国女王做侦查的家伙？”我这一生都在热切期盼着能有陌生人来问我这个问题在我的幻想中，她们应该是苗条的俄罗斯女人但是，你们懂的，四岁的孩子——在加州的伯克利还有什么好奢求的呢
en:But that&#39;s actually not very helpful either.The thing that made me understandthat quote and really kind of what art,at least the art of fiction, was,was working with kids.I used to be a summer camp counselor.I would do it on my summers off from college,and I loved it.It was a sports summer campfor four- to six-year-olds.I was in charge of the four-year-olds,which is good, becausefour-year-olds can&#39;t play sports, and neither can I.(Laughter)I play sports at a four-year-old level,so what would happen is the kids woulddribble around some cones, and then got hot,and then they would go sit underneath the treewhere I was already sitting — (Laughter) —and I would just make up stories and tell them to themand I would tell them stories about my life.I would tell them about how, on the weekends,I would go home and I wouldspy for the Queen of England.And soon, other kidswho weren&#39;t even in my group of kids,they would come up to me, and they would say,&quot;You&#39;re Mac Barnett, right?You&#39;re the guy who spies for the Queen of England.&quot;And I had been waiting my whole life for strangersto come up and ask me that question.In my fantasy, they were svelte Russian women,but, you know, four-year-olds —you take what you can get in Berkeley, California.

zh-cn:然后我意识到，这些故事在以我熟悉的方式讲给孩子们时变得无比真实且振奋人心这件事达到顶峰的契机——我永远不会忘记这件事——我的组里有个叫莱利的小女孩，小个子她总是每天把午饭拿出来然后把里面的水果扔掉她拿出水果她妈妈每天给她装一个甜瓜但是她把它扔进藤蔓丛里然后吃水果零食和布丁我对她说：“莱利你不能那样。必须把水果吃掉”她问“为什么？”我就说：“嗯，你要是把甜瓜扔到藤蔓丛那儿那里很快就会长满一整片的甜瓜”这就是为啥我后来成为儿童故事书的作者，而不是成为孩子们的营养师了莱利说：“那种事不会发生的绝对不可能”因此，夏令营的最后一天我早早起床到杂货店买了一个大哈密瓜把它藏进了藤蔓丛里午饭时间，我说“莱利，你真该看看你都做了些什么”然后— (笑声) —她吃力地穿过藤蔓然后一下瞪大眼睛发现了这个比她的脑袋都大的哈密瓜之后所有的孩子都跑过去簇拥在她四周其中一个孩子突然叫道“嘿，哈密瓜上面为什么粘着个标签？”（笑声）我就说：“这就是为什么我也不让你们把标签扔进藤蔓丛里要把它们丢进垃圾桶乱丢的话会破坏环境”莱利一整天都带着那个哈密瓜她无比自豪
en:And I realized that the stories that I was tellingwere real in this way that was familiar to meand really exciting.I think the pinnacle of this for me — I&#39;ll never forget this —there was this little girl named Riley. She was tiny,and she used to always take out her lunch every dayand she would throw out her fruit.She would just take her fruit,her mom packed her a melon every day,and she would just throw it in the ivyand then she would eat fruit snacksand pudding cups, and I was like, &quot;Riley,you can&#39;t do that, you have to eat the fruit.&quot;And she was like, &quot;Why?&quot;And I was like, &quot;Well, whenyou throw the fruit in the ivy,pretty soon, it&#39;s going to be overgrown with melons,&quot;which is why I think I ended uptelling stories to children and notbeing a nutritionist for children.And so Riley was like, &quot;That will never happen.That&#39;s not going to happen.&quot;And so, on the last day of camp,I got up early and I got a big cantaloupefrom the grocery storeand I hid it in the ivy,and then at lunchtime, I was like,&quot;Riley, why don&#39;t you go overthere and see what you&#39;ve done.&quot;And — (Laughter) —she went trudging through the ivy, and then her eyesjust got so wide, and she pointed out this melonthat was bigger than her head,and then all the kids ran over there and rushed around her,and one of the kids was like, &quot;Hey,why is there a sticker on this?&quot;(Laughter)And I was like, &quot;That is also why I saydo not throw your stickers in the ivy.Put them in the trash can. Itruins nature when you do this.&quot;And Riley carried that melon around with her all day,and she was so proud.

zh-cn:莱利知道她无法在七天内种出哈密瓜来但她也知道她确实做到了那是个不可思议的区域然而它并不是只有孩子才能做到我们都可以。我们可借助艺术到达那里她就是在真实与谎言的交界处在可以被称之为艺术或虚构的区域里我更愿意称这个区域为“奇迹”这就是柯尔律治所说的”自愿悬置怀疑“或者说，“诗意的信仰”意思是说对于一个拥有真实表象的故事不管它有多奇怪你都能够相信不是只有孩子们能做到大人也可以，我们可以通过阅读做到这就是为什么在两天內人们涌入都柏林来一场“布鲁姆日”的远足见证《尤利西斯》的故事里发生的一切尽管那些事情从未发生过人们也去伦敦，造访贝克街看看夏洛克·福尔摩斯的公寓尽管221B只是一个被涂在建筑物上的编号那个门牌号也从未存在过我们知道这些角色不是真实的但是我们会对他们产生真实的感情我们可以做到我们知道这些角色不是真实的然而我们也相信他们是真的
en:And Riley knew she didn&#39;t grow a melon in seven days,but she also knew that she did,and it&#39;s a weird place,but it&#39;s not just a place that kids can get to.It&#39;s anything. Art can get us to that place.She was right in that place in the middle,that place which you could call art or fiction.I&#39;m going to call it wonder.It&#39;s what Coleridge called thewilling suspension of disbeliefor poetic faith,for those moments where astory, no matter how strange,has some semblance of the truth,and then you&#39;re able to believe it.It&#39;s not just kids who can get there.Adults can too, and we get there when we read.It&#39;s why in two days, people will bedescending on Dublin to take the walking tourof Bloomsday and see everythingthat happened in &quot;Ulysses,&quot;even though none of that happened.Or people go to London and they visit Baker Streetto see Sherlock Holmes&#39; apartment,even though 221B is just a number that was paintedon a building that never actually had that address.We know these characters aren&#39;t real,but we have real feelings about them,and we&#39;re able to do that.We know these characters aren&#39;t real,and yet we also know that they are.

zh-cn:孩子们比大人容易做到这一点这就是我热爱创作儿童文学的原因我认为对于虚构的文学作品来说孩子们是最好的读者我还是个孩子的时候我一直对“秘密之门”的那类小说无比着迷比如说《纳尼亚传奇》（Narnia）在故事里，穿过衣橱的柜门就能进入魔幻世界我那时坚信那样的秘密之门确实存在我尝试着寻找它们梦想着进入秘密之门我想穿越那个虚构的世界——其实我就是去开人家的衣柜门（笑声）我尝试翻遍我妈妈的男朋友的衣柜里面没有藏着秘密的魔幻世界但是却有些奇怪的玩意儿我觉得我妈妈应该知道（笑声）我很乐意把那些玩意儿告诉妈妈
en:Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can,and that&#39;s why I love writing for kids.I think kids are the best audiencefor serious literary fiction.When I was a kid,I was obsessed with secret door novels,things like &quot;Narnia,&quot;where you would open a wardrobeand go through to a magical land.And I was convinced that secret doors really did existand I would look for them and try to go through them.I wanted to live and cross over into that fictional world, which is —I would always just open people&#39;s closet doors. (Laughter)I would just go through my mom&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s closet,and there was not a secret magical land there.There was some other weird stuff thatI think my mom should know about.(Laughter)And I was happy to tell her all about it.

zh-cn:大学毕业后 我的第一份工作就是在“秘密之门”后面做事这地方叫&quot;826瓦伦西亚&quot;（826 Valencia）它坐落于瓦伦西亚街826号位于旧金山的山米逊区我在那里工作的时候有一家出版公司在那里设立总部 名叫麦克斯维尼（McSweeney&#39;s）一家非营利的写作中心名叫“826瓦伦西亚”但是它的前方是一家奇怪的小商店你们知道那里是零售店区在旧金山，他们不可能为我们开例开这家店的是一个名叫戴夫·埃格斯的作家为了遵守规范他说：“好我就在这儿开家海盗用品商店吧”他真的就这么做了（笑声）店里很漂亮，全木的拉开抽屉就能找到柑橘吃了它可以防止坏血病他们有五颜六色的眼罩因为海盗们一到春天就想疯一下你们不会知道 黑色多无聊啊 寡淡无味还有五颜六色的假眼珠子，玻璃做的，（戴哪个）取决于你要如何处理要面对的情况关于那个商店最奇怪的是人们居然来买东西后来，店铺的收入足够为店铺后面的辅导中心支付租金但对我来说，更重要的是工作的质量孩子们来学习写作在你经过像这样的真实与虚构的交界处，然后写作的时候你的作品一定会受到影响这是一扇你可以穿越的“秘密之门”
en:After college, my first job was workingbehind one of these secret doors.This is a place called 826 Valencia.It&#39;s at 826 Valencia Streetin the Mission in San Francisco,and when I worked there, therewas a publishing companyheadquartered there called McSweeney&#39;s,a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia,but then the front of itwas a strange shop.You see, this place was zoned retail,and in San Francisco, they werenot going to give us a variance,and so the writer who foundedit, a writer named Dave Eggers,to come into compliance with code, he said, &quot;Fine,I&#39;m just going to build a pirate supply store.&quot;And that&#39;s what he did. (Laughter)And it&#39;s beautiful. It&#39;s all wood.There&#39;s drawers you can pull out and get citrusso you don&#39;t get scurvy.They have eyepatches in lots of colors,because when it&#39;s springtime, pirates want to go wild.You don&#39;t know. Black is boring. Pastel.Or eyes, also in lots of colors,just glass eyes, depending on how you wantto deal with that situation.And the store, strangely,people came to them and bought things,and they ended up paying the rentfor our tutoring center, which was behind it,but to me, more important was the factthat I think the quality of work you do,kids would come and get instruction in writing,and when you have to walk this weird, liminal,fictional space like this to go do your writing,it&#39;s going to affect the kind of work that you make.It&#39;s a secret door that you can walk through.

zh-cn:因此，我在洛杉矶为“826”工作我的活儿就是打理那儿的一间小店铺店名叫“回声公园·时间旅行商店”我们还有个格言“无论什么时代，我们都已去过了”（笑声）它坐落于洛杉矶的日落大道我们友好的员工随时恭候他们来自不同时代包括1980年代。就是站在最后面的那个家伙他所处的时代并不久远这是我们的“本月优秀员工”名单上有成吉思汗、查尔斯•狄更斯有些伟人都上了我们的榜这是我们的药品区我们有些专利药品有用来装人体器官的“卡诺卜坛”还有“共产主义肥皂”，上面标着“这就是你今年的肥皂”（笑声）店铺开张的第一天晚上，我们的冰沙机坏掉了我们不知道怎么办才好我们的设计师身上被溅满了红色的糖浆看起来就像他刚杀了人，全身都是血迹就这个人而言其实也不是不可能我们束手无策本来这台机器是我们店里的亮点所以我们就给它挂上了这个指示牌“故障，请昨天再来”（笑声）结果它成为了一个比冰沙更棒的笑料所以我们一直保留着那个指示牌“長毛象肉块”每罐的重量差不多7磅“野人驱除剂”装满了沙拉和百花香—野人最恨这个了［拉丁文］［古埃及文］死语言（笑声）水蛭：“大自然的小医生”还有“维京气味”，里面混合了好几种很赞的气味脚趾甲、汗液和腐烂蔬菜的味儿，还有火葬的柴灰因为我们认为你应该在战场找斧牌香体喷雾而不是在你的腋下去找（笑声）我们还出售机器人情感晶片有了晶片，机器人就能感受到爱或恐惧店内最畅销产品是「幸灾乐祸」这是我们没有想到的（笑声）我们从未想过会如此畅销但这家店后面的写作中心，是非盈利性质的孩子们进入门上贴有「非员工勿进」标示的写作中心然后就在这里做功课、编故事、制作电影这是新书发布会孩子们在这里阅读这里每季度都要发行孩子们利用每天放学后的时间在这里完成的写作作品我们还举行发布会孩子们一边吃着蛋糕一边把作品读给父母听还用香槟酒杯喝牛奶这里真的是一个很特别的地方完全是因为前面的那家怪异商店笑话不再是笑话小说里看不出拼接的痕迹我超爱这点，正是这种小小说俘获了现实世界我觉得它有点像三维立体书
en:So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles,and it was my job to build the store down there.So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart.That&#39;s our motto: &quot;Wheneveryou are, we&#39;re already then.&quot;(Laughter)And it&#39;s on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.Our friendly staff is ready to help you.They&#39;re from all eras,including just the 1980s, that guy on the end,he&#39;s from the very recent past.There&#39;s our Employees of the Month,including Genghis Khan, Charles Dickens.Some great people have come up through our ranks.This is our kind of pharmacy section.We have some patent medicines,Canopic jars for your organs,communist soap that says,&quot;This is your soap for the year.&quot;(Laughter)Our slushy machine brokeon the opening night and we didn&#39;t know what to do.Our architect was covered in red syrup.It looked like he had just murdered somebody,which it was not out of the questionfor this particular architect,and we didn&#39;t know what to do.It was going to be the highlight of our store.So we just put that sign on it that said,&quot;Out of order. Come back yesterday.&quot;(Laughter)And that ended up being a better joke than slushies,so we just left it there forever.Mammoth Chunks. These thingsweigh, like, seven pounds each.Barbarian repellent. It&#39;s full of saladand potpourri — things that barbarians hate.Dead languages.(Laughter)Leeches, nature&#39;s tiny doctors.And Viking Odorant, whichcomes in lots of great scents:toenails, sweat and rotten vegetables, pyre ash.Because we believe that Axe Body Sprayis something that you shouldonly find on the battlefield,not under your arms.(Laughter)And these are robot emotion chips,so robots can feel love or fear.Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude,which we did not expect.(Laughter)We did not think that was going to happen.But there&#39;s a nonprofit behind it,and kids go through a doorthat says &quot;Employees Only&quot;and they end up in this spacewhere they do homework and write storiesand make films and this is a book release partywhere kids will read.There&#39;s a quarterly that&#39;s publishedwith just writing that&#39;s done by the kidswho come every day after school,and we have release partiesand they eat cake and read for their parentsand drink milk out of champagne glasses.And it&#39;s a very special space,because it&#39;s this weird space in the front.The joke isn&#39;t a joke.You can&#39;t find the seams on the fiction,and I love that. It&#39;s this little bit of fictionthat&#39;s colonized the real world.I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions.

zh-cn:有个词叫「元小说」即讲述小说的小说现在「元」的概念非常热门上次流行的时候可能是 1960 年代以小说家约翰•巴思和威廉•加迪斯为代表这个技法现在还有人在用它的历史几乎和讲故事一样久远其中有一个元小说技巧是打破第 4 堵墙 对吧举个例子，演员面向观众说道：「我是个演员他们只是些椽木」即使是这种看似诚实的介绍在我看来，也是为了揭露谎言使小说人为的虚构性更加突出对我而言，我喜欢反其道而行之如果我要拆除第 4 堵墙我希望小说逃离进入现实世界我希望书籍能成为一扇秘密之门开启故事王国，再进入现实世界
en:There&#39;s a term called metafiction,and that&#39;s just stories about stories,and meta&#39;s having a moment now.Its last big moment was probably in the 1960swith novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis,but it&#39;s been around.It&#39;s almost as old as storytelling itself.And one metafictive techniqueis breaking the fourth wall. Right?It&#39;s when an actor will turn to the audienceand say, &quot;I am an actor,these are just rafters.&quot;And even that supposedly honest moment,I would argue, is in service of the lie,but it&#39;s supposed to foreground the artificialityof the fiction.For me, I kind of prefer the opposite.If I&#39;m going to break down the fourth wall,I want fiction to escapeand come into the real world.I want a book to be a secret door that opensand lets the stories out into reality.

en:And so I try to do this in my books.And here&#39;s just one example.This is the first book that I ever made.It&#39;s called &quot;Billy Twittersand his Blue Whale Problem.&quot;And it&#39;s about a kid who gets a blue whale as a petbut it&#39;s a punishmentand it ruins his life.So it&#39;s delivered overnight by FedUp.(Laughter)And he has to take it to school with him.He lives in San Francisco —very tough city to own a blue whale in.A lot of hills, real estate is at a premium.This market&#39;s crazy, everybody.But underneath the jacket is this case,and that&#39;s the cover underneath the book, the jacket,and there&#39;s an adthat offers a free 30-day risk-free trialfor a blue whale.And you can just send in aself-addressed stamped envelopeand we&#39;ll send you a whale.And kids do write in.

en:So what Eliot and the other kidswho send these in get backis a letter in very small printfrom a Norwegian law firm —(Laughter) —that says that due to a change in customs laws,their whale has been held up in Sognefjord,which is a very lovely fjord,and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjordand Norwegian food for a little while. It digresses.(Laughter)But it finishes off by saying thatyour whale would love to hear from you.He&#39;s got a phone number,and you can call and leave him a message.And when you call and leave him a message,you just, on the outgoing message,it&#39;s just whale sounds and then a beep,which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound.And they get a picture of their whale too.So this is Randolph,and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nicowho was one of the first kids to ever call in,and I&#39;ll play you some of Nico&#39;s message.This is the first message I ever got from Nico.
