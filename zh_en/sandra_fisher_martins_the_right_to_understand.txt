zh-cn:我想和你们分享一个故事，这要从我1996年在英国读书时开始说起。有一天，当我正在浏览我的银行账单，（当然，也没太多值得看的）我发现在账单上角有一个标识，我正要给你们看看，上面说明这份结单是使用平语书写的，以便于我更好理解。这个想法激起了我的兴趣；于是我去了解了一下这方面的情况，发现了一个关于呼吁简化语言的运动，名字叫做“简明英语运动”。我曾有那么一两天痴迷于这种想法，但之后就再也没想过了。从那以后，我就回到并一直呆在葡萄牙，我遇到过很多文件：比如我的工作合同，房产证明，电费单……这一系列的文件都让我回想起了当时的银行结单。不是因为它们同等的简洁明了，而是因为情况与之恰恰相反。我必须要把每份文件读两到三遍，才能明白它们到底写了什么。之后，那个1996年就埋在我心中的种子开始萌芽了。于是有一天，我走进了老板的办公室，辞去了我的工作以全心投入这件事。那么，我最先碰到了什么呢？我发现问题比我想象中的还要严重。不仅仅是文件复杂和惹人生厌的问题，事实上，葡萄牙民众的读写能力是极其低下的。读写能力就是理解书面文件的能力我要给你们展示一个关于葡萄牙人民读写能力的调查表。我们能看出在葡萄牙有10~11%的人，
en:The story I want to tell you about, started to me,in 1996 when I was studying in England.One day, I was glancing through my bank statement(I didn&#39;t have much to look at)and I&#39;ve noticed that in the upper corner there wasa symbol, that I&#39;m going to show you,saying that document had been made inplain language, for me to understand it.The idea interested me; I tried to find outwhat that wasand I found out that there was a campaign for thesimplification of language,which was the &quot;Plain English Campaign&quot;.I thought it was a fabulous idea, for about one day or two,and I&#39;ve never thought about it since.When I came back to Portugal, for good,I came across with several documents - for example, my work contract,the papers I had to sign to buy a house, the electricity bill —a series of documents that reminded me of that bank statement.Not because they were equally clear and simple,but because they were the exact opposite.Because I had to read everything twice or thrice, to begin to understand what was written there.And then, that little seed that had been sownin 1996, started germinating.And one day, I found myselfentering through my boss&#39; office and quitting my job to dedicate myself to this.And so, what did I find out, right off the start?I found out that it was a much more severe problem than I thought.It wasn&#39;t only about these documents being complex and annoying,it was the fact that Portuguese people&#39;s literacy —literacy is the hability to understand written documents —is extremely low. I&#39;m going to show you a chart about Portuguese people&#39;s literacy [rate].You know that about 10, 11% of people, in Portugal,

zh-cn:是完全没有能力阅读或书写的。还有些人是知道，或者说按照他们自己的说法是知道如何读写的人。所以，我们就有一批标红的等级1的人，他们只有最低等级的读写能力。他们有能力去组合字母，但他们其实无法真正理解。举个例子，假如一个属于红色区域的人，需要拿一份药品说明书，去给他/她的孩子开一副药，他/她是没法理解说明书上的信息的。这就有50%的葡萄牙人了。那些处在黄色区域的，有超过30%的人，他们只能理解基本日常用语。也就是说，如果不是太新潮或是困难的用语，他们是能够看懂的。但是，举个例子，如果他们在工厂工作，来了一台新机器，他们必须要阅读机器的使用说明才能操作它，但是他们读不懂。所有这些人，占据了80%的葡萄牙人口。我们还有一些能够看懂文件的人，只要不是太复杂的那种。而只有5%的人口，是可以理解很复杂的文件的。你一定认为这不正常，这是瑞典的情况。当我们只有20%的人有核心日常用语的读写能力时，瑞典有75%的人有。通过看这些数据，我明白了什么？我意识到我们正生活在一个信息隔离的环境中。我意识到只有一小部分人能够真正接触信息并为己所用，而大部分人却做不到。正因为他们接触不到，所以他们是被排除在外的，他们是受损的。让我给你们举个例子。这位是多明戈斯先生，是我家大楼的看门人。多明戈斯先生从27岁开始阅读，所以，他属于我们之前看过的黄色部分的群体。有些时候，当我回到家，他就会说：“桑德拉女士好！”“你好，多明戈斯先生！”“这有一封简短的信。”具体来说就是：当多明戈斯先生，或是家里人，邻居收到了一些他们看不懂的东西，他们就会找到我，让我帮他们翻译。一如往常，那次他和我这样说：“喔，桑德拉小姐，我正准备把它扔掉，帮我看看重不重要吧。”那个文件很重要。他已经等那个膝盖手术很久了，那是一封来自著名外科银行的支票信件。当一个人久病未治，他们就会得到支票以支援他们在私营部门做手术。多明戈斯先生的那封信，差点儿就被丢进了垃圾箱。就在那年，我还发现了，只有20%的人是真正使用那些外科银行的支票的。另外的80%的人，我不相信他们是在等待的过程中就被治愈了。最可能的情况是他们和多明戈斯先生一样：“啊！这是什么？我不懂啊，算了，扔掉吧。”他们就这样丢掉了做手术的机会。这代表这什么呢？当人们不理解文字的时候，会造成严重的后果——对于个人和国家来说都是这样。当我不懂得我的权利，我能获得的好处时，我同样无法理解我的义务，也就无法成为积极参与社会活动的公民。也许现在，你正坐在这里想着：“啊，可怜的多明戈斯先生……运气太背了，不是吗？我？我属于绿色的人群。”“我很肯定我属于绿色人群。我都被选来TED现场了不是吗？”（笑声）现在，我要给你们念一段内容，当我读完的时候，你们就知道你们属于哪群人了。所以，来吧，这是一份汽车保险合同。上面写着：“除合同条款例外，当被保人死亡，且法定受益人先于被保人死亡的情况，保险金由被保人继承人继承；或法定受益人与被保人同时死亡的情况，保险金将由法定受益人继承人继承。”怎么样？（笑声）下一个，我们来看另一个，来自一份医药说明，上面写着：“警告！有可能导致红斑，水肿，囊泡，角质疣，荨麻疹。”怎么样？你懂了吗？这个才是最棒的。这是我在周五签署的新办公室租令合同它太搞笑了。上面写着：“我，身为联署人，保证及时支付租金，放弃丧失抵押品赎回权划分之前的好处。”当我听到“及时支付”我想象自己冲进去，［译注：葡萄牙语里面是“闪电支付”］砰地关上门，说：“这是我的租金！！！”（笑声）但不是这样的！（笑声）（掌声）但不是这样的！（掌声）（掌声）（掌声）所以，当我们走出我们的专业领域——一点点，没必要谈到弦理论那种程度，［译注：弦理论是种物理理论］只需要超纲一点点……（笑声）会发生什么呢？我们就会和多明戈斯先生一样不知所措。而且这些文件并非专家写给专家的，不是弦理论那种。不！这些文件是写给我的，这些都是公众文件，这些我需要在日常生活中理解的公众文件，以此掌握自己和生活。这些文件包括租赁合同，药品说明。都是这类的，还有电费单。这些都需要很清晰，这样我才能看懂。因为，如果我看不懂，会发生什么呢？我会犯错，我会做出错误的理解。我来给你们举个犯错的例子，因为看不懂文件，从而作出了糟糕的决定。你们还记得发生在美国的那次次贷危机吗？发生了什么呢？人们签署贷款买房子，却并不知道他们签署的是什么。因为如果他们知道他们签署的内容的话，他们就应该明白当利息上涨时，他们每月的还款量也会增加，那时候他们就没有能力偿还了，最后就会失去他们的房子。在那之后，一切就完了，我们知道这种后果的。你认为如果我们在金融领域一向有着清晰表达的传统的话，事情还会变成这样吗？我认为不会。所以我们应该如何解决这个问题，如何解决存在于葡萄牙人实际读写能力这么低，和那些日常须知的公共文件的复杂度，那么高，之间的巨大差距？所以，最先进入脑海的想法应该是：如果读写率这么低，让我们来提升一下。是吗？让我们来教育人群。让我们……当然，我们会教育大众的。问题是这很难，而且速度很慢。我都不愿去想象需要多少代人才能使我们达到瑞典的水平。但除此之外，不仅是慢的问题。其实还有另一个问题。如果文件用语无法简明化，我们已经见证了和你们一样具有高读写能力的人们，在复杂语言环境下，他们仍然会搞不清，他们依旧无法理解这些文件。所以，现在，除了需要提高读写率以外，更重要的是去降低文件的复杂程度，去简化语言。我给你们一个例子。当我谈论到简化语言。注意！在合约的左侧：“一致认同的是保险公司，等等，……”这是一个简化前后的对比例子。简化语言是什么意思呢？是以一种更加简洁清晰的方式去表达，以便于读者更好而直观的理解内容。你更偏向哪一种？之前的还是之后的？这个问题的答案毫无争议，不是吗？所以我们应该如何实现这呢？我们怎样才能让国家和公司以一种众人皆知的语言去交流？有几种办法。有些国家采取了立法途径。举个例子，瑞典和美国在去年，通过了法案，强制国家以民众能够理解的语言去沟通。然后你就想，“好吧，那很正常。毕竟它们是稍微领先的国家。瑞典，也许比美国更先进。但总而言之，它们都是稍微领先的国家。要是在我们的国家也有相关立法该多好啊！”所以真的变成现实了。自从1999年，现代化行政部门的法令要求国家与人民之间应该使用更加简洁，清晰，表意明确的语言交流，不使用首字母缩写词等等。但事实上，这些法令并没有得到应用。所以，现在的问题是通过法律途径，通过立法加强，只在那些制定法律是为了实施的国家起作用。好吧，还有另一种，通过营销途径。这又是如何起效的呢？是这样的：私企改变他们的语言；使用更加简明的方式书写，他们对此大做文章，而消费者喜欢这些，销量上涨了，效果很好。但这只对私人部门企业有作用。现在，第三种道路，也是我本人最重视的途径是什么的？是基于心理变化上的市民运动方式。在那些实施这些运动的国家——你还记得我提的那个英语标签，“简明英语运动”——这些都是基于消费者的运动的。所以，怎样才能促使市民运动发生呢？我们需要理解很重要的两点：其一，要知道这些公共文件并非一时兴起，不是好奇心需求。它们在我们日常生活中是必要的。最重要的一点，这是一种权利，是我们每个人的权利。在这里，我们要明白：理解是一种权利。我们以必须认识到另一点，那就是：那个写作的人，必须以被理解为目的进行写作。我们要如何实现呢？首先：我们自己必须做高要求的消费者和公民。这样说吧：下次当有人给你一份你看不懂的文件时，不要感到害羞，不要保持沉默，或假装你能够看得懂。不要！你需要知道。去提问吧。我知道这并不容易。转身朝向房间里的绅士，询问：“看一下这份合约的这个部分，是什么意思？”这并不容易，也许还会有一点儿尴尬，是吗？不，不是这样的。这是聪明的表现。当你们的孩子们在学校产生疑问时，你们是如何教导他们的？“别告诉任何人，保持沉默并假装聪明。”不，你不会这么说，对吧？你会说：“恩，当你有不懂的地方的时候，高举你的手，问老师问题，直到弄清楚为止。”作为消费者和社会公民，我们也该这么做。所以，当你下次遇到看不懂的文件，要求去弄懂，放下你的傲气，询问直到你完全弄懂。然后，就另一个问题，我会说：“好吧，这些糟糕的文件，是在流通当中的，它们不是长在树上的。某些人撰写了它们。”是吧？也许，在这些大群体当中，一部分人……我也不清楚，一些律师，一些公职人员——我不是在要求你们去指认自己，我是在要求你们寻找自己的良知。你们曾为大众撰写过多少文件，曾使用你的语言，为那些与你语种相异的人们写过多少文件？然后你们会说：“额，那是有原因的，这儿！”亲爱的朋友们，各种理由我都听说过了。有上千种理由，像是：“这是地方文化。” “哦，我的老板规定这样的！”“是为了法官，如果说这些需要用于法庭裁决呢？”“你这是在摧毁语言，我们需要教育人们。”“我们不能降低水准”等等。这些我都见识过，这些都是借口。不久之前，他们和我们讲了关于爱因斯坦的故事。爱因斯坦说：“如果你无法用一种简洁的语言描述一种事物，那是因为，事实上你并不理解它。”所以说，假如你……（掌声）对于爱因斯坦……（掌声）对爱因斯坦……（掌声）额，我没有足够的时间了！所以说，如果你知道你想说什么——你们知道的吧？——如果你们明白想表达的内容的话，你们只需要做一件事：相信简洁的表达是完全可能的。你们该如何做呢？这很简单。就当写给你们的祖母，怎样？写给你们的奶奶。我给你们看一下奶奶。（笑声）你们要使用尊重的语言，脱去家长作风。我将教给你们三种技巧。首先：把最重要的写在最前头。奶奶很忙碌的。她不会打算从三页纸当中找寻中心思想的。把最重要的写在最前头。接下来，使用简短的句子，因为奶奶，就像我们每个人一样，如果你使用过长的句子，当她读完句子的时候，她就会记不得句子开头的部分。最后，第三点，使用平语，使用奶奶知道的那些词汇。好吗？很简单的！在我离开之前，我想和你们谈谈“Clara”（葡萄牙语）“Clara”是一个关于社会责任的项目。它有一个任务：去改变大众交流的方式。我们应该怎么做呢？我们即将发行本年度的“Claro”指南，其中，我们选取了非常，非常复杂的那些内容，然后使用简洁的方式表达它们。我们就那“Claro”《法律指南》开始说吧。我想这个领域，应该是手到擒来吧。（掌声）我正要跟从曼纽尔先生的建议。现在是时候询问了，如果有谁想要赞助“Claro”《法律指南》——我不知道，举个例子，EDP基金会，或者，嗯……可以等会儿来和我谈谈。我们做的另一件事，就是给最好和最糟糕的文件颁奖，因为，事实上，有不少人正为语言的简洁化目标奋斗着，他们需要被嘉奖，而那些对此熟视无睹的懒人们，他们需要被羞辱。所以我们要为最好和最坏的颁奖。我正指望着你们的帮助。（谢谢）（掌声）我们将会，将会通过Clara的Facebook发布一项运动所以，申请添加好友，你将获得最新资讯。但是，最重要的，“Clara”的目标究竟是什么？它希望能够在你们的头脑里植入两个观点。第一：要去理解，不要害羞。还有就是以理解为目的的去写作，就当是为你们的奶奶写作。如果你们没有奶奶，就当是为了多明戈斯先生吧，他会喜欢的。谢谢。（掌声）
en:don&#39;t know how to read nor write at all, yet.Over there are those who know, or say they know, how to read and write. So, what do we have?We have that group of red people in level 1, which is the lowest in literacy [rate].They are persons who are able to join letters,but they can&#39;t, actually, understand.For example, if a person, from that red group, has to pick upthe package leaflet of a medicinal product, to give a dose of medicine to his/her child,he/she can&#39;t, can&#39;t understand the information.50% of the Portuguese. Then we have 30% more, those yellow ones,over there, people who get byon the daily basis.That is, if they don&#39;t have to read anything too new or too different, they will manage.But, for example, if they work in a factory and a new machine arrivesand they have to read the machine&#39;s manual to be able to work with it, they can&#39;t do it anymore.And there they go, 80% of the Portuguese people.Then we have a few more that can handle documents,as long as they are not too complex,and we have 5% of the population that can handle really complex documents.Now, just so you don&#39;t think this is normal, that over there is Sweden.While we have 20% of people with the literacy considered essential for a daily basis,Sweden has 75%.And looking at that, what did I realize?I realized we live in an apartheid of information.I realized that there&#39;s a small minority of people who has indeed access to informationand can use it to their advantage and a huge majority that can&#39;t.And because they can&#39;t, they are excluded and they are impaired.Let me give you an example.That one is Mr. Domingos, my building&#39;s doorkeeper. Mr. Domingos started to read at the age of 27,so, he falls in that yellow group that we have seen a little while ago.From time to time, I&#39;m arriving home and he says:&quot;Miss Sandra!&quot;; &quot;Yes, Mr. Domingos.&quot;&quot;Here is a little letter.&quot; So, the deal is: when Mr. Domingos or someone in the family or in the neighbourhoodreceives something that they don&#39;t understand, they come to me and I help them to translate it.And so, that time he said to me like this:&quot;Oh, Miss Sandra, I&#39;m about to throw this away, but check it if this is important.&quot;It was very important. He had been waiting, for quite a while, to have a knee surgeryand that was the letter of the famous surgery-bankchecks. When a person is waiting for a long time,they get a bank check and with that bank check they can have that surgery in the private sector.It was almost thrown away into the garbage, Mr. Domingos&#39; letter.In that same year, I&#39;ve found out,only 20% of people had used these surgery-bank checks.The other 80%, I don&#39;t believe they had been curedwhile they were waiting.They most likely did the same as Mr. Domingos:&quot;Ah! What&#39;s this? I&#39;m not understanding, it&#39;s going to the garbage&quot;.They lost the opportunity to have the surgery they needed.What happens here? When people don&#39;t understandthis has severe consequences — to the individual, but also for the country.When I don&#39;t understand which are my rights, the benefits I can have access to,I can&#39;t understand my duties and I&#39;m not an active and participative citizen either.Now, maybe, you are sitting there and thinking:&quot;Yeah, poor Mr. Domingos... Bad luck, isn&#39;t it? Me?! I&#39;m in the green ones.&quot;&quot;I&#39;m absolutely sure that I&#39;m one of the green ones. I was selected to come to TED! Hum?&quot; (Laughter)So the deal is: I have here some texts to read to youand I&#39;m going to see what color are you when I finish reading.So, come on, this is an automobile insurance contract. It says this:&quot;Unless contrary stipulation, the decease of the ensured person, the ensured capital is provided,in case of predeceasing of the beneficiary relatively to the ensured person, to the heirs of the last,in case of the simultaneous decease of the ensured person and of the beneficiary,to the heirs of the last&quot;. Hum? (Laughter)Next, there&#39;s another one, from the medicines&#39; package leaflet, that says the following:&quot;Warning! It may also occur erythema, edema, vesiculation, keratolysis and urticaria.&quot;Hum? Are you clear?And this one is really good. This one, I signeda renting contract to the new office on Fridayand I laughed my head off.So, it said: &quot;I, as a cosigner, assume the opportune payment of the rents,waiving the benefits of the division and prior foreclosure.&quot;When I heard &quot;opportune payment&quot; [&quot;storm payment&quot; in Portuguese], I imagined myself bursting in there,slamming the door and saying: &quot;Here&#39;s the money!!!&quot;(Laughter)But it&#39;s not! (Laughter) (Applause)But it&#39;s not! (Applause)(Applause)(Applause)So, it&#39;s this: when we leave our area of expertise —and it only takes a little; there is no need to go to the string theory or something like that,it only takes a little... (Laughter)What happens?We get as lost as Mr. Domingos.And these documents are not written by experts to experts,as the ones from the string theory.No! These are documents written for me, these are the public documents,the public documents I need to understand in my daily life,to govern myself, to live my life.These are the renting contracts, the package leaflet of the medicines.It&#39;s all this. The electricity bills.This has to be clear, so that I can understand.Because, if I can&#39;t understand, what happens?I make mistakes, I get wrong.I&#39;m going to give you an example of mistakes that were committed, bad decisions madefor not being able to understand documents.Do you remember the subprime crisis that took place in the United States?What happened?People signed those loans to buy houses,without truly understanding what they were signing.Because if they knew what they were signing,they&#39;d know that as soon as the interest rate startedto rise, the monthly payment would also increase,they wouldn&#39;t be able to pay anymore and they would end up without a house.So, the rest, after that, next, everything crumbled down and we know the rest.Do you think that if there was a culture of clarity in the financial sectorthings would have got up to where they&#39;ve got?I don&#39;t think so. So,how do you solve this problem,this such big difference between the literacy [rate] of the Portuguese,that is down here, and the complexity of the public documents,those ones we need to understandin our daily lives, sorry,that are up here?So, the first think that comes to mind is,&quot;If literacy is down here, let&#39;s make it rise&quot; — isn&#39;t it?Let&#39;s educate people.Let&#39;s, let&#39;s... of course we will, of course we will educate people.The thing is, it&#39;s hard and it&#39;s slow. And I don&#39;t even want to imaginehow many generations it will take until we are at Sweden&#39;s level.But, besides that, it&#39;s not only because it is slow. There is another problem.If the language of the documents isn&#39;t simpler,we&#39;ve already seen that people, even with a high literacy level, like you,if the language is hard, they don&#39;t get cleared,they continue to be unable to understandthese documents.So, besides increasing literacy [rate], and for now,it&#39;s much more important to reduce the complexity of documentsand simplify the language.I&#39;m going to show you an example.When I talk about simplifying the language. Notice!On the left side of a contract:&quot;It is agreed that the insurance company, bla bla bla, bla bla bla, bla bla...&quot;This is a before and after example. What do we mean with simplifying language?It&#39;s communicating in a simple and clear way, enabling our reader to understand it at first glance.What do you prefer? Before or after?There isn&#39;t much doubt, is there?So, how is this achieved? How can you make the State and companies communicatewith citizens in a language they can understand at first glance?There are several ways. There are countries that are going by the path of legislation.For example, Sweden and the United States introduced, last year, a legislation that forcesthe State to communicate with people in a language they can understand.And you think, &quot;Well, that&#39;s normal. They are countries that are a bit ahead.&quot;Sweden, maybe, much more than the United States.&quot;But they are countries that are a bit ahead.&quot;It would be nice if in our country there was also legislation towards that, wouldn&#39;t it be?&quot;So it would. And there is! Since 1999.The Law of the Administrative Modernization says thatthe communication between the State and the peopleshould be simple, clear, concise, meaningful, without acronyms, bla bla bla...But the thing is: it is not applied. So, the question,the path of going through legislation, enforcing through legislation,works in those countries where laws are made to be applied.Now, there is another way, the way of marketing.How does that work? It&#39;s like this:private companies change their language; communicate in a clearer and simpler way,they make a big fuss about it, consumers love it,the sales rise, it works beautifully.But it works for the private sector.Now, what is the third path, and to me, the most important one?It&#39;s the path of civil movements,that are based in a mentality shift.In countries where this really went forward —do you remember the English label, of the&quot;Plain English Campaign&quot;? —this is all based on a consumers&#39; movement.So, what does it take for that civic movement to happen?We need to understand two very important things:First, wanting to understand these public documents is not a whim,is not an intellectual curiosity.It is a necessity that I have in my daily life.And above all, it is a right, it is everyone&#39;s right.On this side we have: understanding is a right.And we have to understand another thing too,which is: he who writes, has to write in order to be understood.How do we get there?First of all: we have to become demanding consumers and citizens.Think it this way: next time someone gives you a documentthat you just simply don&#39;t understand, don&#39;t be shy,don&#39;t keep quiet, pretending that you are understanding everything.No! Demand to understand. Ask.I know that this is not easy. Turn to the gentleman in the little suite and say:&quot;Look here, this contract, this part, what does this mean?&quot;It&#39;s not easy, and perhaps it&#39;s even a bit embarrassing, isn&#39;t it?But it is not. It&#39;s a sign of intelligence.What do you teach your children when they have doubts in school?&quot;Don&#39;t say nothing to anyone, shut up really good and act smart.&quot;No, you don&#39;t, right? You say:&quot;Look, when you don&#39;t understand, you put your hand up in the air and ask the teacher until you are cleared.&quot;And that is exactly what we have to do, as consumers and citizens.So, next time you come across with a document you don&#39;t understand,demand to understand, put aside your pride and askuntil you get completely cleared.Then, there&#39;s the other side, which is:&quot;Okay, these awful documents&quot;which are in circulation, they don&#39;t grow on trees.&quot;Someone wrote them.&quot; Hum?Maybe, among this big group, some persons...I don&#39;t know, some lawyers, some public employees —I&#39;m not asking you to identify yourselves,but I ask you to search your own conscience.How many times do you write documents for the general public,for people that don&#39;t share your language,and you write them in a language that only you will understand?And you&#39;ll say: &quot;Ah, that&#39;s because there is a reason, here!&quot;Dear friends, I already heard all the reasons.There are thousands of reasons. They go like these:&quot;Ah, it&#39;s the house&#39;s culture&quot;; &quot;Oh, my boss!&quot;&quot;Oh, the judge! And what if this goes to court?&quot;&quot;What you want is to destroy language. We have to educate people.&quot;&quot;We can&#39;t lower the level&quot;; bla, bla, bla...I&#39;ve seen all of this. These are excuses.A while ago, they told us about Einstein.Einstein said this: &quot;If you can&#39;t write about a subject,in a simple way, it&#39;s because, in fact, you don&#39;t understand it.&quot;So, if you... (Applause)To Einstein... (Applause)To Einstein...(Applause)So — ah, ah, I don&#39;t have time! —so, if you do know what you want to say — don&#39;t you? —you are aware of what you want to say,you just have to do one thing: believe that it is possible to write in a simple way.And how do you do that?It&#39;s very easy. You write to your grandmother. Hum?You write to your grandmother. I&#39;m going to show grandma to you.(Laughter)You write with respect and without paternalism.And you use three techniques that I&#39;m going to teach you. First of all:Start by the most important.Grandma has a lot to do. She is not going to readthree pages to get to the main idea.Start by the most important.Next, use short sentences, because grandma,like anyone of us,if you make very long sentences,she gets to the end and she can&#39;t remember what you said in the beginning, anymore.And lastly, the third, use plain words, those ones that grandma knows.Alright? It&#39;s easy!Before I leave,I would like to talk to you about &quot;Clara&quot; (Clear). &quot;Clara&quot; is a project of social responsibility.It has this mission: to change the way how public communication is made.What do we do?We are going to launch this year a collection of &quot;Claro&quot; guides,that is, we are going to pick very, very, very complex subjects and put them simple.We are going to start with the &quot;Claro&quot; Guide of Justice.I think it is an area... that comes in handy. (Applause)And now I&#39;m going to follow Manuel [Forjaz]&#39;s advise. If it&#39;s time to ask,whoever wants to sponsor the &quot;Claro&quot; Guide of Justice — I don&#39;t know...for example, the EDP Foundation, or...ha? —come talk to me later.Another thing we will do is to grant prizes to the worse and best documents,because, indeed, there are people who are workingto communicate in a clearer way,and that have to be rewarded,and there are lazy people that do nothing about it and need to be humiliated.So, we&#39;ll give prizes to the worst and to the best.I&#39;m counting on your help. (Applause)(Applause)We are going to launch... we are going to launchthe campaign via Clara&#39;s Facebook,so, send your friendship request and you&#39;ll be up to date.But, lastly, above all, what does &quot;Clara&quot; want?It wants to put two little things in your heads.The first one: demand to understand. Don&#39;t be shy.And write in order to be understood. Write to your grandma.And if you don&#39;t have a grandmother, write to Mr. Domingos, he will like it.Thank you. (Applause)
