zh-cn:我想先从佩斯利蜗牛案说起1928年8月26日晚上梅·多诺霍乘火车从格拉斯哥前往向东七英里外的小镇佩斯利在镇上的一家叫Wellmeadow 的咖啡馆里她喝了一杯雪顶苏格兰这是一种混合了冰淇淋和姜汁啤酒的饮料是她朋友给她点的姜汁啤酒的酒瓶是棕色的 ，且不透明上面有“D. 斯蒂文森, 格林巷,佩斯利&quot;的标签她喝了一些混合冰激凌饮，但当她把剩下的姜汁酒倒到玻璃杯里时一只腐烂了的蜗牛从杯子里浮了上来三天之后 她住进了格拉斯哥皇家医院被确诊为严重肠胃炎并伴有休克
en:I&#39;d like to start, if I may,with the story of the Paisley snail.On the evening of the 26th of August, 1928,May Donoghue took a train from Glasgowto the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city,and there at the Wellmeadow Café,she had a Scots ice cream float,a mix of ice cream and ginger beerbought for her by a friend.The ginger beer came in a brown, opaque bottlelabeled &quot;D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley.&quot;She drank some of the ice cream float,but as the remaining ginger beer was pouredinto her tumbler,a decomposed snailfloated to the surface of her glass.Three days later, she was admittedto the Glasgow Royal Infirmaryand diagnosed with severe gastroenteritisand shock.

zh-cn:之后发生在多诺霍和斯蒂文森公司之间的官司开创了一个重要的法律先例：姜汁啤酒的生产商斯蒂文森对梅·多诺霍女士负有明确的责任即便他们之间没有签订合约甚至连这杯饮料都不是她自己买的一位法官 阿特金爵士解释道：人们应该尽力避免那些可以合理地预知会伤害到邻居的行为或疏忽的确， 我们无法想象， 如果没有慎独义务在斯蒂文森公司倒闭之前还会有多少人得忍受肠胃炎的侵扰
en:The case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followedset a very important legal precedent:Stevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer,was held to have a clear duty of caretowards May Donoghue,even though there was no contract between them,and, indeed, she hadn&#39;t even bought the drink.One of the judges, Lord Atkin, described it like this:You must take care to avoid acts or omissionswhich you can reasonably foreseewould be likely to injure your neighbor.Indeed, one wonders that without a duty of care,how many people would have had to sufferfrom gastroenteritis before Stevensoneventually went out of business.

zh-cn:请记住佩斯利蜗牛案因为此案包含了一条重要的原则去年 一个无党派的慈善组织伦敦汉萨德学会(Hansard Society)为了加强议会民主鼓励公众更广泛的参与政治他们在出版年度政治参与度审计年报时增加了一个专门讨论政治和媒体的章节以下是这次调查中一些令人沮丧的观察结果小报并没有的提高读者们的政治公民权的迹象他们甚至和那些从不看报的人没什么两样只读小报的人持有负面政治观点的可能性是不读报纸的人的两倍他们不仅仅在政治生活中不作为还通过媒体的报道来强化他们负面的政治观点从而对民主和他们自身在民主中所扮演的角色产生一种宿命论和愤世嫉俗的态度很少有人会怀疑 这些报道得出这样的结论：在这个方面，出版方 ，尤其是这些小报明显地没有起到它们在民主中所扮演角色的重要性
en:Now please hang on to that Paisley snail story,because it&#39;s an important principle.Last year, the Hansard Society,a nonpartisan charitywhich seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracyand encourage greater public involvement in politicspublished, alongside their annual auditof political engagement, an additional sectiondevoted entirely to politics and the media.Here are a couple of rather depressing observationsfrom that survey.Tabloid newspapers do not appearto advance the political citizenship of their readers,relative even to thosewho read no newspapers whatsoever.Tabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agreewith a negative view of politicsthan readers of no newspapers.They&#39;re not just less politically engaged.They are consuming media that reinforcestheir negative evaluation of politics,thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynicalattitude to democracy and their own role within it.Little wonder that the report concluded thatin this respect, the press, particularly the tabloids,appear not to be living up to the importanceof their role in our democracy.

zh-cn:我想这个房间里应该没有人会严肃地质疑这个观点但如果汉萨德学会没有错，通常如此那我们就遇到一个非常棘手的问题一个我在接下来的十分钟想要探讨的问题
en:Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriouslychallenge that view.But if Hansard are right, and they usually are,then we&#39;ve got a very serious problem on our hands,and it&#39;s one that I&#39;d like to spend the next 10 minutesfocusing upon.

zh-cn:自从佩里斯蜗牛事件以来尤其是在过去十年间关于慎独义务的概念产生了非常多的观点它和公民社会中的很多方面息息相关。通常，当一个个体或一群个体从事一项对他人可能造成伤害的活动无论是身体、精神还是经济上这就牵涉到慎独义务这主要体现在比较明显的方面如我们对儿童和青少年对服务行业员以及老人和弱者的同情和理解它很少会企及关于政府现有体系的脆弱性这一命题的重要性，而诚实、准确和公平的概念是建立和植入一种（公众）知情并积极参预民主的基础。你越仔细思考就会越觉得奇怪
en:Since the Paisley snail,and especially over the past decade or so,a great deal of thinking has been developedaround the notion of a duty of careas it relates to a number of aspects of civil society.Generally a duty of care arises when one individualor a group of individuals undertakes an activitywhich has the potential to cause harm to another,either physically, mentally or economically.This is principally focused on obvious areas,such as our empathetic responseto children and young people,to our service personnel, andto the elderly and infirm.It is seldom, if ever, extendedto equally important argumentsaround the fragility of ourpresent system of government,to the notion that honesty, accuracy and impartialityare fundamental to the process of buildingand embedding an informed,participatory democracy.And the more you think about it,the stranger that is.

zh-cn:几年以前 我很荣幸在英格兰的东北部开了一所新学校学校学生们把它重新命名为360学院在我穿过让人印象深刻有着玻璃外观的门廊在我的前方的墙上以金色字体装饰着马可奥利斯伍斯(Marcus Aurelius)的名言：不对的，就不要说出来不正确的 ，就不要去做校长注意到我在盯着这行字看告诉我说 这是我们的校训回伦敦的火车上这句话在我脑海里一直挥之不去我一直想 ，难道我们真的需要2000多年才能总结出这一简单的主张作为我们对彼此的最低期望？难道现在不是我们该发展慎独义务这种观念并把它延伸成一种我们曾拥有但日渐消亡的民主价值？毕竟，在很多行业都缺失的慎独义务可以全部归咎于失职那就是上面的案例。我们是否能够真的认同我们实际上忽视了尊重我们自身社会的健康以及所有支撑它们的价值？谁能实事求是，有凭有据地指出，汉萨德学会极力谴责的媒体已经采取了足够的小心来避免那些可以显而易见地可能逐渐蚕食或侵害我们与生俱来的脆弱民主的建立
en:A couple of years ago, I had the pleasureof opening a brand new schoolin the northeast of England.It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360.As I walked through their impressive,glass-covered atrium,in front of me, emblazoned on the wallin letters of firewas Marcus Aurelius&#39;s famous injunction:If it&#39;s not true, don&#39;t say it;if it&#39;s not right, don&#39;t do it.The head teacher saw me staring at it,and he said, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s our school motto.&quot;On the train back to London,I couldn&#39;t get it out of my mind.I kept thinking, can it really have taken usover 2,000 years to come to termswith that simple notionas being our minimum expectation of each other?Isn&#39;t it time that we develop this conceptof a duty of careand extended it to include a carefor our shared but increasinglyendangered democratic values?After all, the absence of a duty of carewithin many professionscan all too easily amount toaccusations of negligence,and that being the case, can we bereally comfortable with the thoughtthat we&#39;re in effect being negligentin respect of the health of our own societiesand the values that necessarily underpin them?Could anyone honestly suggest, on the evidence,that the same media whichHansard so roundly condemnedhave taken sufficient care to avoid behavingin ways which they could reasonably have foreseenwould be likely to undermine or even damageour inherently fragile democratic settlement.

zh-cn:现在可能有些人会反驳这很容易变成检查制度或自我检查，但是我不同意。通过普世道德和社会责任来平衡言论自由是可能的
en:Now there will be those who will arguethat this could all too easily drift into a formof censorship, albeit self-censorship,but I don&#39;t buy that argument.It has to be possibleto balance freedom of expressionwith wider moral and social responsibilities.

zh-cn:我来解释一下为什么举自己作为电影导演的例子在职业生涯中 我从未认同导演应该把工作置于一种高尚价值观之外或之上无论是对自己的还是家庭以及我们所处在的未来社会我想延伸一下一个负责的导演不应贬低自己的工作使其比他们自己期望栖居的世界要低的地步我认为电影工作者 记者 甚至博客作者都应该直面社会期待这种期待同媒体固有的力量相连同他们的职业技能相连很明显 这并不是规定的义务但对于有才华的导演和负责的记者或博客作家，能打动我的是他们的非常自觉。
en:Let me explain why by taking the examplefrom my own career as a filmmaker.Throughout that career, I never acceptedthat a filmmaker should set about puttingtheir own work outside or above what he or shebelieved to be a decent set of valuesfor their own life, their own family,and the future of the society in which we all live.I&#39;d go further.A responsible filmmaker shouldnever devalue their workto a point at which it becomes less than trueto the world they themselves wish to inhabit.As I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggersare all required to face up to the social expectationsthat come with combining theintrinsic power of their mediumwith their well-honed professional skills.Obviously this is not a mandated duty,but for the gifted filmmakerand the responsible journalistor even blogger, it strikes meas being utterly inescapable.

zh-cn:我们应时刻谨记自己对个人自由以及它的朋友——创作自由的见解在西方思想史中不是久已有之的价值正因如此 它才会被贬低会被逐渐蚕食这种价值很容易被遗忘一旦遗忘， 一旦妥协就很难再追回。而它的第一道防线是我们自己的标准不是强加于我们的审查或立法，是我们自己的标准和正直。当我们同他人工作时的正直以及在参与社会活动时的标准我们的这些标准需要成为可持续发展的社会议程他们是集体责任的一部分艺术家和记者的责任按照世界的真实情况来处事并且反过来，必须同治理社会的原则相联系共同面对世界而且不会被不正当的理由所引诱。然而，这在过去的几年中这种责任在很大程度上越发明显地被媒体削弱。由此导致拮抗各方的过于简单化的政策和他们的请愿的巨大幻灭，这在西方世界尤为普遍老龄人群还有冷漠的被琐碎之事困扰的年轻人全都混杂在一起 ，还有其他类似的当代问题正在步步逼紧，让生活中不再拥有积极的讨论和政治参与。在此我强调积极。
en:We should always remember that our notionof individual freedom andits partner, creative freedom,is comparatively newin the history of Western ideas,and for that reason, it&#39;s often undervaluedand can be very quickly undermined.It&#39;s a prize easily lost,and once lost, once surrendered,it can prove very, very hard to reclaim.And its first line of defensehas to be our own standards,not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation,our own standards and our own integrity.Our integrity as we deal with thosewith whom we workand our own standards as we operate within society.And these standards of oursneed to be all of a piece witha sustainable social agenda.They&#39;re part of a collective responsibility,the responsibility of the artist or the journalistto deal with the world as it really is,and this, in turn, must go hand in handwith the responsibility of those governing societyto also face up to that world,and not to be tempted to misappropriatethe causes of its ills.Yet, as has become strikingly clearover the last couple of years,such responsibility has to a very great extentbeen abrogated by large sections of the media.And as a consequence, across the Western world,the over-simplistic policies of the parties of protestand their appeal to a largely disillusioned,older demographic,along with the apathy and obsession with the trivialthat typifies at least some of the young,taken together, these and other similarlycontemporary aberrationsare threatening to squeeze the lifeout of active, informed debate and engagement,and I stress active.

zh-cn:最热忱的自由主义者也许会认为多诺霍和斯蒂文森公司应该被抛出法庭并且如果他继续卖有蜗牛的姜汁啤酒公司会最终停业但是 ，我们中的大多数都认同州立法在加强慎独义务上应有的小角色。这里的关键词就是合理法官们需要自问， 他们是否采取合理的谨慎他们是否能合理预见自己决策带来的影响？那远非放大了州立法的权力而是小小的合理的常识性的试验我希望我们对媒体也一样。媒体毕竟为我们现在的民主话语设置了导向和内容
en:The most ardent of libertarians might arguethat Donoghue v. Stevenson shouldhave been thrown out of courtand that Stevenson would eventuallyhave gone out of businessif he&#39;d continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it.But most of us, I think, accept some small rolefor the state to enforce a duty of care,and the key word here is reasonable.Judges must ask, did they take reasonable careand could they have reasonably foreseenthe consequences of their actions?Far from signifying overbearing state power,it&#39;s that small common sense test of reasonablenessthat I&#39;d like us to apply to those in the mediawho, after all, set the tone and the contentfor much of our democratic discourse.

zh-cn:为了发扬民主理性的人们需要花时间理解并讨论一些困难复杂的问题他们会在一种能够激发某种理解的氛围下讨论这种理解即便不能使他们达成一致也会有所进展 ，并有可行的折中办法政治关乎选择在选择之后 ，政治关乎优先是随时随地基于事实调节对优先偏好的冲突但如果事实已被扭曲，结果只能会给今后制造更多的冲突整个社会都会不可避免的疲惫不堪媒体需要做出决定他们的角色是加剧愤怒还是传播信息因为最终都归结于信任和领导力的结合
en:Democracy, in order to work, requires thatreasonable men and women takethe time to understand and debatedifficult, sometimes complex issues,and they do so in an atmosphere which strivesfor the type of understanding that leads to,if not agreement, then at least a productiveand workable compromise.Politics is about choices,and within those choices, politics is about priorities.It&#39;s about reconciling conflicting preferenceswherever and whenever possibly based on fact.But if the facts themselves are distorted,the resolutions are likely onlyto create further conflict,with all the stresses and strains on societythat inevitably follow.The media have to decide:Do they see their role as being to inflameor to inform?Because in the end, it comes down to a combinationof trust and leadership.

zh-cn:50年前的这周 肯尼迪总统发表了两个划时代的演讲一个是关于裁军 另一个是关于公民权第一个演讲马上引出了禁止核试验条约第二引出了1964年民权法案二者都是巨大的飞跃完善健全的民主可以带来伟大的成就但得有一个前提我们需要相信那些做决策的人不是在为他们自己谋福利而是在为人民我们需要以事实为基础的选项明确的布局而不是几个潜在的操控的大公司各自追逐他们自己的小利益我们应该追逐准确没有偏见的信息来做出自己的判断如果我们想为自己的子孙后代提供一种合适的充实的生活我们需要尽最大可能履行慎独义务，为了充满活力的而且希望是一个持久的民主感谢聆听（掌声）
en:Fifty years ago this week,President John F. Kennedymade two epoch-making speeches,the first on disarmamentand the second on civil rights.The first led almost immediatelyto the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,and the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act,both of which represented giant leaps forward.Democracy, well-led and well-informed,can achieve very great things,but there&#39;s a precondition.We have to trust that those making those decisionsare acting in the best interest not of themselvesbut of the whole of the people.We need factually-based options,clearly laid out,not those of a few powerfuland potentially manipulative corporationspursuing their own frequently narrow agendas,but accurate, unprejudiced informationwith which to make our own judgments.If we want to provide decent, fulfilling livesfor our children and our children&#39;s children,we need to exercise to thevery greatest degree possiblethat duty of care for a vibrant,and hopefully a lasting, democracy.Thank you very much for listening to me.(Applause)
