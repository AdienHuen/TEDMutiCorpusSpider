zh-cn:当我第一次到达美丽的津巴布韦时我很难想象这个国家有35%的人口感染艾滋病毒。直到我受邀到那些患者的家里我才认识到人类为传染艾滋病所付出的代价举个例子，这是Herbert和他的祖母当我第一次看到他时，他坐在他祖母的大腿上他因父母双双死于艾滋而成为孤儿他的祖母照顾他直到他也同样死于艾滋他喜欢坐在她的大腿上因为他说躺在床上会觉得很痛当祖母起身去泡茶时，他把Herbert放在我的大腿上我从来没有抱过这么瘦弱的孩子在我走之前， 我问他是否需要些什么我以为他会想要玩具、糖果什么的但他想要的是拖鞋因为他说他的脚会冷
en:When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe,it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the populationis HIV positive.It really wasn&#39;t until I was invited to the homes of peoplethat I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother&#39;s lap.He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS,and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.He liked to sit on her lapbecause he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lapand I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.Before I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.I thought he would ask for a toy, or candy,and he asked me for slippers,because he said that his feet were cold.

en:This is Joyce who&#39;s — in this picture — 21.Single mother, HIV positive.I photographed her before and afterthe birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattanand got a call from a woman who I didn&#39;t know,but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed awayat the age of 23.Joyce&#39;s mother is now taking care of her daughter,like so many other Zimbabwean childrenwho&#39;ve been orphaned by the epidemic.So a few of the stories.With every picture,there are individuals who have full livesand stories that deserve to be told.All these pictures are from Zimbabwe.

zh-cn:KA:事实上，我那时正为一位时尚摄影师做制作的工作那时我一直都在看纽约时报对艾滋病相关的统计和数字感到震惊那些资料非常吓人所以我辞掉工作从事我真正想做的事在2000的12月我花了一整个月呆在博茨瓦那然后又去津巴布韦待了一个月接着在2002年的三月我又去了津巴布韦待了一个月
en:KA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing productionfor a fashion photographer.And I was constantly reading the New York Times,and stunned by the statistics, the numbers.It was just frightening.So I quit my joband decided that that&#39;s the subject that I wanted to tackle.And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month —this is in December 2000 —then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half,and then went back again this March 2002for another month and a half in Zimbabwe.
