zh-cn:提前说一下恐怕我是大家最不想在TED看到的演讲者之一首先，我没有手机所以我很安全其次，作为一个政治理论家我将要跟大家探讨“民主的危机”估计大家会觉得我的话题很枯燥另外，我并不打算为大家给出任何答案我更喜欢留下更多的问题我想要质疑的是最近很流行的一种看法那就是——公开透明能够恢复民主机构的信任
en:I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m one of those speakersyou hope you&#39;re not going to meet at TED.First, I don&#39;t have a mobile,so I&#39;m on the safe side.Secondly, a political theoristwho&#39;s going to talk about the crisis of democracyis probably not the most exciting topic you can think about.And plus, I&#39;m not going to give you any answers.I&#39;m much more trying to add to some of the questions we&#39;re talking about.And one of the things that I want to questionis this very popular hope these daysthat transparency and opennesscan restore the trust in democratic institutions.

zh-cn:我还有一点不足：你们这些TED的教徒都是乐观的人（笑声）基本上你们都相信复杂性，而不相信模棱两可的东西相信你们都已经知道我是保加利亚人调查显示我们保加利亚人是世界上最悲观的（笑声）经济学人杂志最近刊登了一篇文章是关于最近的一次对“幸福”的研究报告文章名称是“幸福，不幸福，以及保加利亚人”
en:There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me.You people, the Church of TED, are a very optimistic community.(Laughter)Basically you believe in complexity, but not in ambiguity.As you have been told, I&#39;m Bulgarian.And according to the surveys,we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world.(Laughter)The Economist magazine recently wrote an articlecovering one of the recent studies on happiness,and the title was &quot;The Happy, the Unhappy and the Bulgarians.&quot;

zh-cn:相信大家已经知道接下来会发生什么了那么，让我们从一个故事开始吧这是一个小国家的大选之日，天空中飘着雨可以是保加利亚，当然也可以是你的国家因为大雨到下午4点才停所以4点前没有人去投票站提交选票雨停了人们才出门去投票统计选票的时候发现四分之三的公民投了空白的选票政府及其反对者们都慌了手脚因为之前，你知道该怎么对付来抗议的人你知道要逮捕谁，要跟谁谈判但是现在，面对投了空白选票的人们，你却不知道该怎么办了！所以，政府决定重新选举但结果更离谱了83%的公民投了空白选票基本上，他们都是走到投票箱前说自己感觉无人可选
en:So now when you know what to expect,let&#39;s give you the story.And this is a rainy election day in a small country —that can be my country, but could be also your country.And because of the rain until four o&#39;clock in the afternoon,nobody went to the polling stations.But then the rain stopped,people went to vote.And when the votes had been counted,three-fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot.The government and the opposition,they have been simply paralyzed.Because you know what to do about the protests.You know who to arrest, who to negotiate with.But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot?So the government decided to have the elections once again.And this time even a greater number,83 percent of the people, voted with blank ballots.Basically they went to the ballot boxesto tell that they have nobody to vote for.

zh-cn:这是Jose Saramago一篇美丽的小说的开场白（译者注：Jose Saramago是葡萄牙小说家、诗人、记者，于1998年获得诺贝尔文学奖，擅长写寓言，对官方理论持怀疑态度）叫做“我看到的”但在我看来这个故事很好地捕捉到了当今欧洲民主存在的问题从某种程度上说没有人质疑民主是政府最好的组成方式民主是唯一的方式问题是很多人开始相信民主不是值得去关注的唯一方式
en:This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramagocalled &quot;Seeing.&quot;But in my view it very well capturespart of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days.On one level nobody&#39;s questioningthat democracy is the best form of government.Democracy is the only game in town.The problem is that many people start to believethat it is not a game worth playing.

zh-cn:在过去的30年，政治学家们观察到投票选举率不断下降那些对投票最没有兴趣的人却是你觉得会从选举中获益最大的人也就是那些没有工作的、没有权势的可怜的人这才是问题所在因为特别是现在，随着经济危机的出现你可以发现，人们对政治的信任对民主机构的信任都已经被完全摧毁了根据欧洲委员会最新的调查欧洲89%的公民认为政策制定者和公众的看法存在着存在巨大的缺口只有18%的意大利人，15%的希腊人认为投票是重要的人们都开始觉得，他们能把政府换掉但改不了政策
en:For the last 30 years, political scientists have observedthat there is a constant decline in electoral turnout,and the people who are least interested to voteare the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting.I mean the unemployed, the under-privileged.And this is a major issue.Because especially now with the economic crisis,you can see that the trust in politics,that the trust in democratic institutions,was really destroyed.According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission,89 percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gapbetween the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public.Only 18 percent of Italians and 15 percent of Greeksbelieve that their vote matters.Basically people start to understand that they can change governments,but they cannot change policies.

zh-cn:我想问的是：为什么，在一个如此美好的社会一个比以前自由的社会一个让我们有权力，让我们自由翱翔的社会一个让我们掌握了更多信息的社会我们在爱这个社会的同时，却对民主机构完全丧失信任了呢？所以，我真正想问的是：在这50年中，我们的民主到底什么地方是对的，什么地方做错了我们先看看正确的方面
en:And the question which I want to ask is the following:How did it happen that we are living in societieswhich are much freer than ever before —we have more rights, we can travel easier,we have access to more information —at the same time that trust in our democratic institutionsbasically has collapsed?So basically I want to ask:What went right and what went wrong in these 50 yearswhen we talk about democracy?And I&#39;ll start with what went right.
时间： 4:31
zh-cn:在我看来，第一件正确的事就是以下这五场革命五场深刻改变了我们的生活方式、加深了我们对民主的认识的革命第一场革命是1968年到1970年间的文化和社会革命它把个人推到了政治的中心那是属于人权的时刻这场革命也是一次重大的突破，形成了一种多元的文化一种不服从统一的文化一种我们之前闻所未闻的文化所有我认为它们当时就像68年出生的孩子尽管我们当中的很多人那时都还没有出生但是在那之后，你经历了上世纪80年代的市场改革——尽管很多左翼人士都讨厌它——但事实上就是这次市场革命传递出这样的真理：“政府不比我们知道的更多”你就有了一个存在更多选择的社会然后，1989年，共产主义和冷战都结束了这才是全球化的开始然后你有了因特网我并不是想告诉大家因特网在多大程度上给了我们力量但因特网改变了我们交流的方式我们也成了审视政治的人政治集团的理念也因为因特网完全改变了我还要提到一个革命一个大脑科学的革命它颠覆了我们理解人类决策的方式
en:And the first thing that went right was, of course,these five revolutions which, in my view,very much changed the way we&#39;re living and deepened our democratic experience.And the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s,which put the individual at the center of politics.It was the human rights moment.Basically this was also a major outbreak, a culture of dissent,a culture of basically non-conformism,which was not known before.So I do believe that even things like thatare very much the children of &#39;68 —nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then.But after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s.And nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it,the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message:&quot;The government does not know better.&quot;And you have more choice-driven societies.And of course, you have 1989 — the end of Communism, the end of the Cold War.And it was the birth of the global world.And you have the Internet.And this is not the audience to which I&#39;m going to preachto what extent the Internet empowered people.It has changed the way we are communicatingand basically we are viewing politics.The very idea of political community totally has changed.And I&#39;m going to name one more revolution,and this is the revolution in brain sciences,which totally changed the waywe understand how people are making decisions.

zh-cn:以上就是对的事情（译者概括一下：1968年社会文化革命、1980年市场改革、1989年冷战结束、因特网的出现、大脑科学革命）下面是做错的事情那就是我们要结束上面的5次革命了因为你有了1960年到1970年间的文化和社会革命以一种特定的方式摧毁了集体目标的理念而那个理念，包括我们所学过的所有的关于集体的名词民族、阶级、家族——都消失了我们开始喜欢离婚，当然，如果我们还愿意结婚的话所有这些都开始受到攻击所以当人们都只是一味地相信真正重要的是自己那么我们再想鼓励他们参与政治就很难了
en:So this is what went right.But if we&#39;re going to see what went wrong,we&#39;re going to end up with the same five revolutions.Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s,cultural and social revolution,which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose.The very idea, all these collective nouns that we have been taught about —nation, class, family.We start to like divorcing, if we&#39;re married at all.All this was very much under attack.And it is so difficult to engage people in politicswhen they believe that what really mattersis where they personally stand.

zh-cn:然后你有80年代的市场改革这加剧了社会的不平等要知道，到1970年为止民主的延伸，总是伴随着不平等性的下降之前的状况是，社会越民主社会也就越平等现在却反过来了如今，民主的延伸总是造成更多的不平等现在，每当我跟别人讨论我们的民主什么是对的，什么是错的我都为此觉得很无力
en:And you have the market revolution of the 1980sand the huge increase of inequality in societies.Remember, until the 1970s,the spread of democracy has always been accompaniedby the decline of inequality.The more democratic our societies have been,the more equal they have been becoming.Now we have the reverse tendency.The spread of democracy now is very much accompaniedby the increase in inequality.And I find this very much disturbingwhen we&#39;re talking about what&#39;s going on right and wrongwith democracy these days.

zh-cn:到了1989年有些事情，你一般都认为是无可指责的正确的事情实际上，很多人会告诉你：”正是冷战的结束撕毁了西欧在精英阶层和大众阶层之间的社会契约“苏维埃存在的时候富人和权贵是需要民众的因为他们惧怕苏维埃政权现在，那些上层人士彻底解放了他们可以随处流动，你无法正常对他们征税了他们也不怕民众了结果，你会发现一个奇怪的现象上层人士都摆脱了投票的控制这不是偶然的投票者也不再热衷于投票了
en:And if you go to 1989 —something that basically you don&#39;t expect that anybody&#39;s going to criticize —but many are going to tell you, &quot;Listen, it was the end of the Cold Warthat tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe.&quot;When the Soviet Union was still there,the rich and the powerful, they needed the people,because they feared them.Now the elites basically have been liberated.They&#39;re very mobile. You cannot tax them.And basically they don&#39;t fear the people.So as a result of it, you have this very strange situationin which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters.So this is not by accidentthat the voters are not interested to vote anymore.

zh-cn:关于因特网没错，它连接了世界但是我们也知道，因特网创造了回音室，创造了政治贫民区在那里，你终生都要与你属于的政党站在一起你就会发现，理解与你不同的人群会越来越困难我知道这里的很多人都喜欢讨论数字化的世界和合作的可能性但是你是否看到这些年数字化世界对美国政治造成的影响？这其中有一部分就是因特网革命造成的这就是所谓的”一个硬币有两面“
en:And when we talk about the Internet,yes, it&#39;s true, the Internet connected all of us,but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettosin which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to.And it&#39;s becoming more and more difficultto understand the people who are not like you.I know that many people herehave been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation,but [have you] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days?This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution.This is the other side of the things that we like.

zh-cn:然后你再看看大脑科学政治顾问们从科学家那里学到的就是不要再跟我讨论思想不要再跟我讨论政策的制定程序对他们来说，什么能真正操控人们的情绪，什么就是真正重要的你还可以强烈地感觉到今天在某种程度上，即使你看到我们大家在讨论革命这些革命都不再根据某种意识形态或者思想被命名以前，革命都是有意识形态上的名称的它们可以是共产主义的，可以是自由主义的可以是法西斯主义或者伊斯兰主义的现状，它们却被根据媒介来命名你看到了Facebook革命，Twitter革命内容不再重要，问题是媒介是谁
en:And when you go to the brain sciences,what political consultants learned from the brain scientistsis don&#39;t talk to me about ideas anymore,don&#39;t talk to me about policy programs.What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.And you have this very stronglyto the extent that, even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days,these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas.Before, revolutions used to have ideological names.They could be communist, they could be liberal,they could be fascist or Islamic.Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used.You have Facebook revolutions, Twitter revolutions.The content doesn&#39;t matter anymore, the problem is the media.
时间： 9:30
zh-cn:我这么说是因为我的主要观点之一就是那些正确的也可以变成错的当我们现在试图去发现我们能如何改变现状的时候当我们试图去发现我们能为民主做些什么的时候我们必须接受一些模棱两可的东西因为可能那些我们最喜爱的将会成为伤我们最深的如今很流行的观点是大家喜欢透明所以积极的公民、新的科技、更透明的立法被联合起来使用来恢复大家对政治的信任你坚信，当你有了新科技和喜欢使用新科技的公民可以更好地防止政府作假政府想要偷取什么、杀害谁都会因此而变得更困难也许你是对的但我认为，我们应当清楚是我们把透明推到政治的中心而政治总是讨厌透明的
en:I&#39;m saying this because one of my major pointsis what went right is also what went wrong.And when we&#39;re now trying to see how we can change the situation,when basically we&#39;re trying to see what can be done about democracy,we should keep this ambiguity in mind.Because probably some of the things that we love mostare going to be also the things that can hurt us most.These days it&#39;s very popular to believethat this push for transparency,this kind of a combination between active citizens, new technologiesand much more transparency-friendly legislationcan restore trust in politics.You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this,it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie,it&#39;s going to be more difficult for them to stealand probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill.This is probably true.But I do believe that we should be also very clearthat now when we put the transparency at the center of politicswhere the message is, &quot;It&#39;s transparency, stupid.&quot;
时间：10:39
zh-cn:所以透明并没有恢复信任透明只是在政治上管理”不信任&quot;的一种手段而已我们这纯粹只是在假设我们的社会将基于“不信任”而被建立起来顺便说一句，“不信任”对民主来说总是非常重要的这也是为什么我们有了分权制度为什么我们有了这些创造出来的“不信任”有了这些在代表（指政府）和那些他们所代表的人（指大众）之间的“不信任”但是，当政治仅仅作为管理“不信任”的方式而存在时那么——我很高兴《1984》提起过这个——（译者注：1984是乔治·奥威尔的小说，是反乌托邦的三大小说之一，主题为反对极权主义）我们就会退回到“1984”它不会变成“娱乐老大哥秀”（译者注：Big Brother is watching you是全方位时刻观察游戏者的竞赛节目，语出《1984》）而我们将变成那个时刻观察别人的Big Brother我们将始终盯着政治阶层
en:Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions.Transparency is politics&#39; management of mistrust.We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust.And by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy.This is why you have checks and balances.This is why basically you have all this creative mistrustbetween the representatives and those whom they represent.But when politics is only management of mistrust,then — I&#39;m very glad that &quot;1984&quot; has been mentioned —now we&#39;re going to have &quot;1984&quot; in reverse.It&#39;s not going to be the Big Brother watching you,it&#39;s going to be we being the Big Brotherwatching the political class.
时间：11:22
zh-cn:这是自由社会的理念么？例如，请你想象一下当优秀的公民要参与竞选如果他们真的认为政治也是要管理“不信任”的你就不对那些科技感到害怕么？这些科技将会追踪政治家们对特定问题的所有看法由于对政治家来说，自己观点的一致性要比常识重要所以即使错了，他们也要坚持重复自己的观点对于这样不理性的政治，你不感到恐惧么？此刻坐在这间房子里的美国人你们难道就不害怕你们的总统永远按照自己在竞选预选时所说的话那样来管理你们么
en:But is this the idea of a free society?For example, can you imaginethat decent, civic, talented people are going to run for officeif they really do believethat politics is also about managing mistrust?Are you not afraid with all these technologiesthat are going to track downany statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues,are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politiciansto repeat their positions, even the very wrong positions,because consistency is going to be more important than common sense?And the Americans who are in the room,are you not afraid that your presidents are going to governon the basis of what they said in the primary elections?
时间：12:08
zh-cn:我之所以觉得这点极为重要是因为民主就是要公民不断改变观点根据理性的讨论来做出选择但是如果我们放弃了这样（公民要根据理性改变观点）的想法政治就成了作秀变成仅仅为了告诉公民们，我们不会容忍政治家们在政治中的机会主义（译者注：此处的机会主义是指政治家冒险去破坏自己观点的一致性而逃避大众监督）所以对我来说，这点至关重要我确实相信，如今当我们谈论政治时也许想想这样的故事是很合乎逻辑的
en:I find this extremely important,because democracy is about people changing their viewsbased on rational arguments and discussions.And we can lose this with the very noble ideato keep people accountablefor showing the people that we&#39;re not going to toleratepoliticians the opportunism in politics.So for me this is extremely important.And I do believe that when we&#39;re discussing politics these days,probably it makes senseto look also at this type of a story.
时间：12:39
zh-cn:但请不要忘了，任何的揭露，同时也是一种掩饰不管我们的政府多想要公开透明他们也只是想要有选择地公开透明在一个小国家里，比如保加利亚当然也可能是你的国家他们要求——这是个真实的故事——所有的政府决策所有的内阁讨论都要在讨论结束一天后公布在因特网上供大家监督公众欢呼雀跃所以当我有机会与首相交流我就问他为什么决定如此公开首相说，听着，只有这样才能让议员们都闭嘴因为当他们知道24小时之后所有讨论都要公开他们就必须尽快取得一致了否则就会出现政治危机
en:But also don&#39;t forget, any unveiling is also veiling.[Regardless of] how transparent our governments want to be,they&#39;re going to be selectively transparent.In a small country that could be my country,but could be also your country,they took a decision — it is a real case story —that all of the governmental decisions,discussions of the council of ministers,were going to be published on the Internet24 hours after the council discussions took place.And the public was extremely all for it.So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister,why he made this decision.He said, &quot;Listen, this is the best wayto keep the mouths of my ministers closed.Because it&#39;s going to be very difficult for them to dissentknowing that 24 hours afterthis is going to be on the public space,and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis.&quot;
时间：13:31
zh-cn:所以，当我们讨论透明当我们讨论公开我真的认为我们必须牢记正确的同时就是错误的歌德，既不是保加利亚人，也不是政治学家数个世纪前说过“光线越充足的地方，阴影就越大”
en:So when we talk about transparency,when we talk about openness,I really do believe that what we should keep in mindis that what went right is what went wrong.And this is Goethe, who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist,some centuries ago he said,&quot;There is a big shadow where there is much light.&quot;
