zh-cn:我有怯场的毛病（演讲者：乔·科文）我一直都怯场不是一点点是非常严重的怯场27 岁之前，这毛病对我都没什么影响在 27 岁那年，我开始写歌那时只唱给自己听但一想到室友就在隔壁，我就会觉得不自在
en:Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.I&#39;ve always had stage fright,and not just a little bit,it&#39;s a big bit.And it didn&#39;t even matter until I was 27.That&#39;s when I started writing songs, and even thenI only played them for myself.Just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable.

zh-cn:几年后，我不再满足于单纯写歌我有很多故事和创意想跟人们分享但生理上，我做不到就因为这没来由的紧张恐慌但我写的歌得越多，练得越多就越想表演给大家看
en:But after a couple of years, just writing songs wasn&#39;t enough.I had all these stories and ideas,and I wanted to share them with people,but physiologically, I couldn&#39;t do it.I had this irrational fear.But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced,the more I wanted to perform.

zh-cn:所以在我 30 岁生日那一周我决定参加社区开麦表演暂时把怯场的问题抛在脑后到了那儿，我发现已经人山人海大概有 20 个人在那里（笑声）他们看起来都很疯狂我深吸一口气，在表演报名单上签了名当时感觉还不错
en:So on the week of my 30th birthday,I decided I was going to go to this local open mic,and put this fear behind me.Well, when I got there, it was packed.There were like 20 people there.(Laughter)And they all looked angry.But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play,and I felt pretty good.

zh-cn:一直到表演前 10 分钟，我都自我感觉良好接着，我全身开始不听使唤整个人也变得非常不安听我说，当你害怕时交感神经系统就开始发挥作用你会肾上腺素增高，心跳加速呼吸变急促那些不太重要的系统开始关闭，比如消化系统（笑声）你会感到口干舌燥，四肢供血不足手指变得僵硬你的瞳孔变大，肌肉收缩你的蜘蛛侠第六感也开始发挥作用基本上，你整个人处于高度备战状态（笑声）只是，这状态很不适合表演民谣（笑声）我的意思是，你的神经系统基本报废了不信？经过二十万年人类进化它却分不清剑齿虎和参加周二晚间开麦表演的 20 名民谣歌手（笑声）我从没那么紧张过，不过现在更紧张（笑声，鼓励声）
en:Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn,when my whole body rebelled, and this wave of anxiety just washed over me.Now, when you experience fear, your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.So you have a rush of adrenaline, your heart rate increases,your breathing gets faster.Next your non-essential systems start to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter)So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routedaway from your extremities,so your fingers don&#39;t work anymore.Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract,your Spidey sense tingles,basically your whole body is trigger-happy.(Laughter)That condition is not conducive to performing folk music.(Laughter)I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can&#39;t tell the differencebetween a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingerson a Tuesday night open mic?(Laughter)I have never been more terrified — until now.(Laughter and cheers)

zh-cn:然后该我表演了我挣扎着走上舞台，开始唱歌我开口唱第一句歌词发出的却是可怕的颤音就是嗓音颤抖时发出的声音但不是歌剧演员那种好听的颤音而是因为害怕，全身发抖发出的声音那真是一场噩梦我尴尬极了，观众也很不自在他们只在关注我的局促不安了真是太糟了这就是我作为唱作歌手的第一次个人表演经历
en:So then it was my turn,and somehow, I get myself onto the stage, I start my song,I open my mouth to sing the first line,and this completely horrible vibrato —you know, when your voice wavers — comes streaming out.And this is not the good kind of vibrato, like an opera singer has,this is my whole body just convulsing with fear.I mean, it&#39;s a nightmare.I&#39;m embarrassed, the audience is clearly uncomfortable,they&#39;re focused on my discomfort.It was so bad.But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter.

zh-cn:当然，也发生了值得高兴的事我微微感受到了希望跟观众达成的共鸣我想它让更强烈当然，我知道必须先解决怯场的问题
en:And something good did happen —I had the tiniest little glimpseof that audience connection that I was hoping for.And I wanted more. But I knew I had to get past this nervousness.

zh-cn:那一晚，我向自己许诺：从今往后，每周都参加开麦表演直到不感到紧张为止我的确这样做了，每周都去经过了一周又一周，果然情况一点儿都没好转，每次上台还是怯场（笑声）我实在摆脱不掉它
en:That night I promised myself: I would go back every weekuntil I wasn&#39;t nervous anymore.And I did. I went back every single week,and sure enough, week after week,it didn&#39;t get any better. The same thing happened every week. (Laughter)I couldn&#39;t shake it.

zh-cn:直到有一天我灵光一现那一刻我记得非常清楚，因为我灵光一现的时候不多（笑声）我唯一需要做的，就是写一首表达我紧张的歌只有当我怯场的时候，这首歌才更有感染力我越紧张就能把歌演绎得越好。这太好办了于是，我开始着手创作一首关于怯场的歌先坦承自己有怯场的毛病说说都有哪些生理表现，有什么心理感受谈谈听众的感受然后再做些解释，比如为什么会发出颤音我知道因为紧张我的音比正常高半个八度有了这么一首解释我状态的歌当我怯场时观众就不会觉得太突兀他们不必因为我紧张而担心我他们可以和我经历这一切我们是开心快乐、局促不安的大家庭（笑声）
en:And that&#39;s when I had an epiphany.And I remember it really well, because I don&#39;t have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter)All I had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness.That only seems authentic when I have stage fright,and the more nervous I was,the better the song would be. Easy.So I started writing a song about having stage fright.First, fessing up to the problem,the physical manifestations, how I would feel,how the listener might feel.And then accounting for things like my shaky voice,and I knew I would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal,because I was nervous.By having a song that explained what was happening to me,while it was happening,that gave the audience permission to think about it.They didn&#39;t have to feel bad for me because I was nervous,they could experience that with me,and we were all one big happy, nervous, uncomfortable family. (Laughter)

zh-cn:我去体会听众的感受，接受并利用自己怯场的问题从而挖出阻碍我前进的因素然后把它转化为成功的必备要素这首怯场歌帮我解决了开场表演最大的障碍这样我就能继续唱下去稍微轻松地表演其他歌曲最终，我甚至完全不需要再唱这首怯场歌了除了我的确非常紧张的时候，比如现在（笑声）
en:By thinking about my audience, by embracing and exploiting my problem,I was able to take something that was blocking my progress,and turn it into something that was essential for my success.And having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issueright in the beginning of a performance.And then I could move on, and play the rest of my songswith just a little bit more ease.And eventually, over time, I didn&#39;t have to play the stage fright song at all.Except for when I was really nervous, like now. (Laughter)

zh-cn:可以为大家唱一次怯场歌吗（掌声）
en:Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you?(Applause)
时间： 4:51
zh-cn:我可以喝口水吗（音乐）谢谢
en:Can I have a sip of water?(Music)Thank you.

zh-cn:嘿，我没开玩笑我真的怯场如果我在台上一边发抖一边歌唱你会知道我的感受我还会搞砸发出颤音那是全身发抖的杰作不用替我尴尬哦，真的不用好吧，可以有一点（笑声）我会想象你们都没穿衣裳但在一群躶体陌生人前唱歌更让我紧张不要细说下去身材从不是我的强项老实说，我希望大家都正装出席我的意思是，不要真的什么也不穿我才是有问题的那个人你们跟我说，不要太烦恼，一定能唱好我一直都陪着自己我知道该怎样做你的建议很贴心，但来得有点晚就算你不是神气十足那挖苦的语调也让我唱不好但现在我们不需要谈论这些真的，我在台上，你在台下。嗨~我没有拿这莫名其妙的恐慌开玩笑如果没准备好去面对我也不会站在这里如果我清晰将一个音符弹唱你会明白我在恢复，慢却稳当或许，下周我会把吉他奏响我的声音清澈如水，大家一起歌唱或许，我会走上台，渐入佳境声带不停震动快得超过声速（掌声）
en:♫ I&#39;m not joking, you know, ♫♫ this stage fright is real. ♫♫ And if I&#39;m up here trembling and singing, ♫♫ well, you&#39;ll know how I feel. ♫♫ And the mistake I&#39;d be making, ♫♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ♫♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ♫♫ well, you don&#39;t have to be. ♫♫ Well, maybe just a little bit. ♫(Laughter)♫ And maybe I&#39;ll try to imagine you all without clothes. ♫♫ But singing in front of all naked strangersscares me more than anyone knows. ♫♫ Not to discuss this at length, ♫♫ but my body image was never my strength. ♫♫ So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, ♫♫ I mean, you&#39;re not even really naked. ♫♫ And I&#39;m the one with the problem. ♫♫ And you tell me, don&#39;t worry so much, you&#39;ll be great. ♫♫ But I&#39;m the one living with me ♫♫ and I know how I get. ♫♫ Your advice is gentle but late. ♫♫ If not just a bit patronizing. ♫♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn&#39;t help me when I sing. ♫♫ But we shouldn&#39;t talk about these things right now, ♫♫ really, I&#39;m up on stage, and you&#39;re in the crowd. Hi. ♫♫ And I&#39;m not making fun of unnurtured, irrational fear, ♫♫ and if I wasn&#39;t ready to face this, ♫♫ I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t be here. ♫♫ But if I belt one note out clearly, ♫♫ you&#39;ll know I&#39;m recovering slowly but surely. ♫♫ And maybe next week, I&#39;ll set my guitar ringin&#39; ♫♫ my voice clear as water, and everyone singin&#39;. ♫♫ But probably I&#39;ll just get up and start groovin&#39;, ♫♫ my vocal cords movin&#39;, ♫♫ at speeds slightly faster than sound. ♫(Applause)
