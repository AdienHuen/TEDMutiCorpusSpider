en:&quot;My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax.My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back.I&#39;m stylin&#39;, smilin&#39;, lookin&#39; real mean,because it ain&#39;t about being heard, just being seen.My leather Adidas baseball cap matchesmy fake Gucci backpack. (Laughter)Ain&#39;t nobody who looks as good as me,but this costs money, it sure ain&#39;t free,and I gots no job, no money at all,but it&#39;s easy to steal all this from the mall.Parents say I shouldn&#39;t, but I knows I should.Got to do what I can to make sure I look good,and the reason I have to look real good, well, to tell you the truth, man,I don&#39;t know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside.When I&#39;m wearing fresh gear I don&#39;t have to hide,and I really must get some new gear soonor my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon.But security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops.My crew is laughing at me because I&#39;m wearing old gear.School&#39;s almost over. Summer is near.And I&#39;m sportin&#39; torn Jordans.I need something new. Only one thing left to do.Cut school Friday, catch the subway downtown,check out my victims hangin&#39; around.Maybe I&#39;ll get lucky and find easy prey.Got to get some new gear. There&#39;s no other way.I&#39;m ready and willing. I&#39;m packing my gun.This is serious business. This ain&#39;t no fun.And I can&#39;t have my posse laughin&#39; at me.I&#39;mma cop something dope, just wait, you&#39;ll see.Come out of the station, West 4th near the park,brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks,&#39;Hey homes, where you get them Nik&#39;s?&#39;I says to myself, &#39;Yeah. I likes &#39;em, I likes.&#39;They were Q-tip white, bright and blinding my eyes.The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly.Not one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new.Had my pistol and knew just what to do.Waited until it was just the right time, followed him very closely behind.He made a left turn on Houston, I pulled out my gun,and I said, &#39;Gimme them Jordans!&#39;And the punk tried to run.Took off fast, didn&#39;t get far. I fired,&#39;Pow!&#39;Fool fell between two parked cars.He was coughing, crying, blood spilled on the street.And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet.While laying there dying, all he could saywas, &quot;Please man, don&#39;t take my Air Jordans away.&quot;You&#39;d think he&#39;d be worried about staying alive.As I took off with his sneakers, there was tears in his eyes.Very next day, I bopped into schoolwith my brand new Air Jordans, man, I was cool.I killed to get &#39;em, but hey, I don&#39;t care,because now I needs a new jacket to wear.&quot;

zh-cn:在过去的15年里，我一直都从事表演，将诗词传播于世界是我一直心驰神往的事。对于我而言，写作并不够。加入大满贯比赛也难以满足我，尽管这些都举足轻重，但仍然难以成为使我的笔尖落到实处。我的渴望，欲望曾在，到现在亦然、我怎样才能使讨厌诗词的人，喜欢上我？因为我是我作品的延续,假如他们喜欢我，自然就会喜欢我的作品，如果他们喜欢我的作品，就会喜欢诗词，如果他们喜欢诗歌，那我的使命就完成了，我要使诗词在世界传播。
en:For the last 15 years that I have been performing,all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world.See, it wasn&#39;t enough for me to write a book.It wasn&#39;t enough for me to join a slam competition,and while those things hold weight,it wasn&#39;t the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad.The hunger and thirst was, and still remains:How do I get people who hate poetryto love me?Because I&#39;m an extension of my work,and if they love me, then they will love my work,and if they love my work, then they will love poetry,and if they love poetry, then I will have done my job,which is to transcend it to the world.

zh-cn:1996年，我在一位叫做 Reg E. Gaines的朗诵艺术大师那里，找到了最初的答案，他是诗歌名篇《请别拿走我的乔丹气垫鞋》的作者。我四处追随这位艺术家，直到我等到了和他独处的机会，我朗诵了我写的诗，你们知道他跟我说了什么吗？他说：“真糟糕.&quot;“你知道你哪儿有问题吗？ 哥们儿”“你不朗诵别人的诗歌”“你的诗里没有一个动量词的附属词”“一点也没有考虑音调”（笑声）他继续在那儿闲聊，关于诗歌、关于诗的风格以及新波多黎各人周五的晚上。
en:And in 1996, I found the answer in principlesin a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines,who wrote the famous poem, &quot;Please Don&#39;t Take My Air Jordans.&quot;And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room,and I read him one of my pieces,and you know what he told me?&quot;Yo&#39; wack.You know what the problem is with you, homie?You don&#39;t read other people&#39;s poetry,and you don&#39;t got any subordination for verbal measuresto tonal consideration.&quot; (Laughter)Now he kept on ramblingabout poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights.

zh-cn:我本来可能就此放弃。我也应该放弃了。我原本以为诗歌只是一种自我表达。我却不知道还需要富有创意。
en:Now I could have quit. I should have quit.I mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression.I didn&#39;t know you actually have to have creative control.
时间： 4:41
zh-cn:但我没有就此放弃。我反而开始四处跟随他。他写百老汇剧本的时候，我就在门外候着。我会在早上六点半叫醒他，问他谁是最优秀的诗人。我记得，我吃过刚从海里捕出来鱼的眼睛，因为他说鱼眼补脑。
en:So instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere.When he was writing a Broadway show, I would be outside of the door.I would wake him up at, like, 6:30 in the morningto ask him who&#39;s the best poet.I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the seabecause he told me it was brain food.

zh-cn:有一天，我问说，”Reg E. 什么是考虑音调的动量词附属词啊？“ （笑声）他递给我一份白纸黑字的论文，一篇关于诗人Etheridge Knight，以及诗歌口头艺术本质的论文，而从那一刻开始，Reggie对我来说，再也不是最好的了，因为那个叫 Etheridge Knight的诗人让我明白，怎样使我的诗词像音乐一样动听，即使那些细小的部分，单音节词，if ，and，but，what这些词，以及我使用的一些黑帮俚语听起来都那么悦耳，从那以后，我就一直追随者Etheridge Knight.我想知道他都读了哪些诗人的诗，我开始练习一首叫做《黑暗预言：光亮之歌》，这首诗歌把我送上了一个诗人梦寐以求的舞台：百老汇的舞台！ 同志们！而从那时开始，我学会了如何甩开麦克风，用我的身体抒发诗歌的情感。
en:Then one day I told him,&quot;Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?&quot; (Laughter)And he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesison a poet named Etheridge Knightand the oral nature of poetry,and from that point,Reggie stopped becoming the best to me,because what Etheridge Knight taught mewas that I could make my words sound like music,even my small ones, the monosyllables,the ifs, ands, buts, whats,the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear,and from then on, I started chasing Etheridge Knight.I wanted to know which poet he read,and I landed on a poem called [&quot;Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine&quot;],a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stagea poet could ever be:Broadway, baby.And from that point, I learned how to pull the mic awayand attack the poetry with my body.

zh-cn:但这还不是我学到的最重要的一课。最重要的一课是很多年后，我在比佛利山庄遇见一个经纪人时学到的，他上下打量着我，说我的经验还不足以让我在这一行混口饭吃。
en:But that wasn&#39;t the biggest lesson I ever learned.The biggest lesson I learned was many years laterwhen I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agentwho looked at me up and downand said I don&#39;t look like I have any experienceto be working in this business.

zh-cn:我回答道：“听着！你个蠢驴，”“你做不了演员，就来做经纪人”“你知道你为什么做不了演员吗？”“是因为像我这样的人才拿了你的工作”“我从克利夫兰和艾塞克斯一路走来”“亨特港的渔船边上排满了长队”“他们挡塞住了我的去路”“我一个人娱乐着无数的男人女人和小孩”“他们在舞台下”“我用我的表演将他们深深地折服”“人们买票来看我的演出”“他们把我的表演当做冰箱磁铁”“来提醒他们革命即将到来，准备好吧！”“我的经验够丰富了“”当你在贵族学校学莎士比亚的十四行诗的时候“”那些诗歌的韵律早就烂熟于我心了“我能用敬畏之心朗诵《哭泣游戏》，就像一个孩子被学校里的恶霸叫做艾滋病患者一样，而这个恶霸并不知道孩子的父亲传染了母亲，母亲又传染给了孩子，这是一种双关。”我经验比我丰富得多，当你去Fell 学校念书时，“”所有的富家子弟都想帮助其中的一个孩子，“”那个孩子就是我，而我却因为教他们怎样从lee牛仔裤上偷走一块潮流手帕并将手帕送给那个艾滋病小孩而逐出校园。“”让我瞧瞧契科夫是怎么把手帕从牛仔裤上面摘下来的我的叔叔曾用Sanford Meisner [美国演员&amp;表演教师，创造了方法表演（method acting）]的话对自己说，“有些事情总是不正确，也没有事情总是正确。”“方法表演只是多种个性的混合，”“相信自己的谎言就是事实，”“这就像在高中时Kenny告诉我他想做个警察一样。”“哥们儿，你去里克岛学院学习，”“我可以让大卫·马梅”“对我的对话进行精神分析，”“让斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基 （《演员的自我修养》的作者、演员、导演）像李小龙一样，”“把你那些毫无天赋的学生们打得鼻青脸肿”“难道你的演员们都是在伦敦培训机构学习的街头表演吗？”“我告诉你一个中国武术界的秘密。”“板子是不会反击的”“你认为黑人在这一行不好混口饭吃吗？”“我就不信，我可是个不信邪的黑白混血”“我很黑，不算白人；我又太白了，做不了黑人”“别说什么美国街头”“我在南非索威特都有我的足迹”“我埋葬过因堕胎而死去的婴儿”“但我仍然可以微笑”“不管在我踏出这道门之后，”“你要跟你那言听计从的助理咒骂我时”“不管你要怎么诽谤我”“尼玛”谢谢（掌声）
en:And I said to him, &quot;Listen, punk fool,you&#39;re a failed actor who became an agent,and you know why you failed as an actor?Because people like me took your job.I&#39;ve traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essexin East New York, took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt&#39;s Pointwho were in my way on my way to master the art of space,and the one-to-infinite amount of man, woman and childyou can fit in there only so I can push themto the back of the wall with my experience.People have bought tickets to my experienceand used them as refrigerator magnets to let them knowthat the revolution is near, so stock up.I&#39;m so experienced that when you wentto a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet,I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me.I can master shock of &quot;The Crying Game&quot; with the aweof a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn&#39;t knowthat it was his father who gave it to my mother,and that&#39;s a double entendre.I&#39;m so experienced that when you went to the Fell Schooland all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a childin it, that was me, but kicked me out when I was caughtteaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeansand bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off.Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself,&quot;Something&#39;s always wrong when nothing&#39;s always right.&quot;Method acting is nothing but a mixtureof multiple personalities, believing your own lies are reality,like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop.Dude, you go to Riker&#39;s Island Academy.I could make David Mametpsychoanalyze my attack on dialogue,Stanislavski be as if he were Bruce Leekicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw.So what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep?Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoonkung fu secret.Boards don&#39;t hit back.You think black entertainers have it hard finding workin this business? I&#39;m a suspicious mulatto,which means I&#39;m too black to be white and too white to be doing it right.Forget the American ghetto. I&#39;ve cracked stages in Soweto,buried abortion babies in potter&#39;s field and still managed to keep a smile on my face,so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshackgo-for-this, go-for-that assistant when I walk out that door,whatever slander you send my way,your mother.Thank you. (Applause)
