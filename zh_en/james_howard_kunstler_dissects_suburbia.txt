zh-cn:我们每日的生活环境正因为僵硬的标准而日益沦为丑陋的世界我们不能低估这样的地方给我们带来的绝望我在这儿最想传达的是：如果我们还想继续在美国这片土地上延续文明，我们必须做得更好顺便说一句，这个不管用它可不会让下面经过的人更愉快
en:The immersive uglinessof our everyday environments in Americais entropy made visible.We can&#39;t overestimate the amount of despairthat we are generating with places like this.And mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do betterif we&#39;re going to continue the project of civilization in America.By the way, this doesn&#39;t help.Nobody&#39;s having a better day down here because of that.

en:There are a lot of ways you can describe this.You know, I like to call it &quot;the national automobile slum.&quot;You can call it suburban sprawl.I think it&#39;s appropriate to call itthe greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world.You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.And it&#39;s a tremendous problem for us.The outstanding — the salient problem about this for usis that these are places that are not worth caring about.We&#39;re going to talk about that some more.A sense of place:your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and characterdepends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings,and to employ the vocabularies, grammars,syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecturein order to inform us who we are.

zh-cn:美国的公共空间有两个用途：社会文明在那儿继续，市民生活在那里进行，那儿同样也是大众利益的集中体现当公共空间的级别降低时，市民生活的质量，以及公共、社会生活的所有内容就自然而然的降级了在美国，最常见的公共空间就是街道，因为我们没有那些古老文明所有的千年大教堂广场以及露天市场我们定义空间、并创造出值得关注的地方的能力都来自我们称作“城市环境设计”这个领域这是一个集知识、方法、技能、原则为一体的整体，而二战之后，我们把它打入了冷宫决定我们再也不需要它了，我们不会再用到它这带来的后果，我们在周围就可以看到公共空间不仅有提示我们所处地理位置的职能，同时也提醒我们，我们的文化所处的位置我们文化的源头在哪儿，我们是怎样的民族——公共空间需要以这种方式使得我们窥见一丝未来的方向，给当下的我们带来一线希望如果说有巨大的灾难——如果说我们已建的东西带来了什么灾难的话那就是我们近50年来给自己营造的居住环境剥夺了我们对在希望中生活的能力
en:The public realm in America has two roles:it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,and it is the physical manifestation of the common good.And when you degrade the public realm,you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic lifeand the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in Americabecause we don&#39;t have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazasand market squares of older cultures.And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring aboutall comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principlethat we threw in the garbage after World War IIand decided we don&#39;t need that anymore; we&#39;re not going to use it.And consequently, we can see the result all around us.The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically,but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.Where we&#39;ve come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we&#39;re goingin order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.And if there is one tremendous —if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we&#39;ve built,the human environments we&#39;ve made for ourselves in the last 50 years,it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.

zh-cn:我们比较典型的生活环境是这样的：这正巧是我住的地方以北两英里处的垃圾建筑行星带还记得吗，创造一个有个性和质量的空间你首先需要有定义空间的能力看看这是如何在这个国家实现的如果你站在这边沃尔玛的停车场上试着看那边儿的Target商店由于地球的曲率，你根本看不着（笑）那是大自然告诉你“你干得很烂”的方式结果是，人们渐渐地再也不想到这些地方来这些地方将要成为不值得关注爱护的地方
en:The environments we are living in, more typically, are like these.You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.And remember, to create a place of character and quality,you have to be able to define space.So how is that being accomplished here?If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over hereand try to look at the Target store over here,you can&#39;t see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter)That&#39;s nature&#39;s way of telling you that you&#39;re doing a poor job of defining space.Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.These will be places that are not worth caring about.

zh-cn:在美国，大概有38000个类似的地方不值得我们爱护等我们有足够多的这样的地方，我们就将要拥有一个不值得保卫的国家了！我希望你们在想到这个的时候，想想还在伊拉克之类地方的那些青年男女们，他们的血正洒在沙子里问问自己他们对家的最后的记忆的什么？我可不希望是查克芝士店和Target商店间的路牙子！因为那不值得美国人为之洒热血（掌声）这个国家必须有更好的公共空间
en:We have about, you know, 38,000 placesthat are not worth caring about in the United States today.When we have enough of them, we&#39;re going to have a nation that&#39;s not worth defending.And I want you to think about that when you think aboutthose young men and women who are over in places like Iraq,spilling their blood in the sand,and ask yourself, &quot;What is their last thought of home?&quot;I hope it&#39;s not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target storebecause that&#39;s not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause)We need better places in this country.

zh-cn:公共空间，这就是个不错的例子它值得我们爱护，有意义，它是一个强有力的室外房间最重要的是——它包着一层所谓的活跃的、可渗透的薄膜就是说，周围有商店、酒吧、小酒馆、各种去处————人们进进出出。随时可以融入啤酒端进端出，服务生进进出出，这些将这个地方激活，让人们喜欢上那儿待着在其他文明中的这类地方，人们自愿去那儿，因为他们喜欢这些地方我们不需要在这儿办个手工艺品展览吸引人们来（笑）也不必举行宽扎节人们自然回去，因为待在那儿是种享受这个是在我们美国的公共空间
en:Public space. This is a good public space.It&#39;s a place worth caring about. It&#39;s well defined.It is emphatically an outdoor public room.It has something that is terribly important —it has what&#39;s called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.That&#39;s a fancy way of saying it&#39;s got shops, bars, bistros, destinations —things go in and out of it. It&#39;s permeable.The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.You know, in these places in other cultures,people just go there voluntarily because they like them.We don&#39;t have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)You know, you don&#39;t have to have a Kwanzaa festival.People just go because it&#39;s pleasurable to be there.But this is how we do it in the United States.

en:Probably the most significant public space failure in America,designed by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:Boston City Hall Plaza.A public place so dismal that the winos don&#39;t even want to go there. (Laughter)And we can&#39;t fix it because I.M. Pei&#39;s still alive,and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.And every year they fail to because they don&#39;t want to hurt I.M. Pei&#39;s feelings.

en:This is the other side of the building.This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.It wasn&#39;t Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,but there&#39;s not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.This is the back of Boston City Hall,the most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany — excuse me — in Boston.And what is the message that is coming,what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this buildingand how is it informing us about who we are?

en:This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraitsof Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building,because then we&#39;d honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.You know, that it&#39;s a despotic building;it wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter)This is it on a smaller scale:the back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York.By the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter)and they shouted at me and said,&quot;It was raining that day when you took that picture!&quot;Because this was perceived to be a weather problem.

en:You know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter)Audio jack, power supply —and look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right?You know, we hire firms to design these things.You can see exactly what went on, three o&#39;clock in the morning at the design meeting.You know, eight hours before deadline,four architects trying to get this building in on time, right?And they&#39;re sitting there at the long boardroom tablewith all the drawings, and the renderings,and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and —I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter)Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.It was: &quot;Fuck it.&quot; (Laughter) (Applause)

en:That — that is the message of this form of architecture.The message is: We don&#39;t give a fuck! We don&#39;t give a fuck.So I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to —you know — do some reality testing,and in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter)it&#39;s not interesting enough for his clients,you know, the burglars, the muggers.It&#39;s not civically rich enough for them to go down there.OK.

zh-cn:美国中心大街的模式实际上，建造市中心街区的模式是相当全球性的并不是那么复杂——多层、高层建筑建在人行道边上所以人们——各种人都可以自由进出其它活动可以在楼上进行也就是办公室、公寓等等在一层为一种叫“购物”的活动提供条件蒙特里没有采用这一模式如果你走到这个会议中心前的主路口处的那个拐角，你就会发现路口的每个角上都有四面空白墙真是神奇
en:The pattern of Main Street USA —in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.It&#39;s not that complicated:buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs,you know, apartments, offices, and so on.You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.They haven&#39;t learned that in Monterey.If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,you&#39;ll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.It&#39;s really incredible.

zh-cn:总之，这就是如何构造和展示市中心商业楼的方法这也是纽约洲格伦斯福尔斯的做法我们想要复制它，因为它很不错，对吗？他们首先把零售店台高了半层，上去还要费神儿好，那完全毁掉了商店和虚拟行人走的人行道的关系（笑）当然，只要保持这个状况，行人是永远也不会来的行人和商店的关系被毁了，我们就建一条方便残疾人的斜坡为了让自己感觉好点儿，我们再在前面贴上一条天然创口贴就是那么干的。我把它们叫做“天然创口贴”因为在美国，普遍看法是补救失败城市的良方是自然。事实上，真正的良方应该是好的城市设计，好的建筑而不只是花坛，不只是内华达山脉的卡通画因为那些不够好我们得建好的建筑
en:Anyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)Of course, they&#39;ll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,we pop a handicapped ramp on that,and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.And that&#39;s how we do it.I call them &quot;nature Band-Aids&quot; because there&#39;s a general idea in Americathat the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.You know, that&#39;s not good enough.We have to do good buildings.

en:The street trees have really four jobs to do and that&#39;s it:To spatially denote the pedestrian realm,to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,and to soften the hardscape of the buildingsand to create a ceiling — a vaulted ceiling — over the street, at its best.And that&#39;s it.

en:You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understandingof the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.They&#39;re not the same thing.And we&#39;re not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.Here you see it on a small scale — the mothership has landed,R2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulchto see if they can inhabit this planet.

zh-cn:这都是因为美国的工业化为我们带来如此大的伤害以至于我们形成了对城市、城市生活、以及相关一切的极大厌恶所以你可以看到早些时候，在19世纪中期我们就要找到解决工业城市问题的解药那就是每个人都生活在乡间这种想法是以铁路市郊的形式来实现的：铁路沿线的乡村别墅，可以让人们享受到城市的便捷设施的同时能够每晚回到郊外相信我，那时候那儿既没沃尔玛又没有便利店所以这是真正的乡居生活的一种方式
en:A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a traumathat we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,city life, and everything connected with it.And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,which is going to be life in the country for everybody.And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:the country villa along the railroad line,which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,but to return to the countryside every night.And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,so it really was a form of country living.

en:But what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 yearsand it turns into something rather insidious.It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.And that&#39;s the great non-articulated agony of suburbiaand one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.Because it hasn&#39;t delivered what it&#39;s been promising for half a century now.

en:And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know.Basically, a house with nothing on the sidebecause this house wants to state, emphatically,&quot;I&#39;m a little cabin in the woods. There&#39;s nothing on either side of me.I don&#39;t have any eyes on the side of my head. I can&#39;t see.&quot;So you have this one last facade of the house,the front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house.Because — notice the porch here.Unless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody&#39;s going to be using that.This is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called &quot;We&#39;re Normal.&quot;We&#39;re normal, we&#39;re normal, we&#39;re normal, we&#39;re normal, we&#39;re normal.Please respect us, we&#39;re normal, we&#39;re normal, we&#39;re normal.

(Laughter)We know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit.Because these places, these habitats,are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,and they don&#39;t have a lot of experience with medication.So they take the first one that comes along, often.These are not good enough for Americans.These are the schools we are sending them to:The Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada.This is a real school!You know, but there&#39;s obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out,that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.So every effort is made to keep them within the building.Notice that nature is present.

en:And we should have started two days before yesterday.We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbageby our parents&#39; generation after World War II.Because we&#39;re going to need it if we&#39;re going to learn how to reconstruct towns.We&#39;re going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skillin order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,that allow — that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic lifeand our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.

en:So that, you know, the residences make sensedeployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.We&#39;re going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:the street, the block, how to compose public space that&#39;s both large and small,the courtyard, the civic squareand how to really make use of this property.We can see some of the first ideasfor retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.The dead malls: what are we going to do with them?Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.They&#39;re not going to be retro-fitted;they&#39;re going to be the salvage yards of the future.

en:Some of them we&#39;re going to fix, though.And we&#39;re going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systemsand returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.And if we&#39;re lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centersin our existing towns and cities.And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they werebecause they occupy all the important sites.And most of them are still going to be there,although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.
