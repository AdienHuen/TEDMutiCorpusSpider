zh-cn:我要告诉你们当我接到大会邀请的时候我对自己说 这可是TED呀这些TEDsters虽然名字听起来是那么单纯而简单可都很不简单 他们是慈善家艺术家科学家 他们能够影响整个世界那我又能说点什么才会让我显得与众不同才能证明我的参与是有意义的呢所以我就想到一口非常纯正显得很有教养的英国口音也许能帮上忙
en:I should tell you that when I was asked to be here,I thought to myself that well, it&#39;s TED.And these TEDsters are — you know, as innocent as that name sounds —these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enoughto justify my participation in something like that?And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accentmight help things a bit.

zh-cn:但转念一想 不 不行 我应该去到那里作回我自己我平时怎么说话 在这儿就怎么说话因为毕竟今天是盛大的揭幕仪式所以我觉得我应该来到这里把我真实的声音展现给你们虽然在座的很多人都知道我确实说一口纯正的“英国女王式”英语因为我来自纽约的皇后区（笑声）但是这一节的主题是创造据我所知 我自己没有任何专利那么你们只能来认识一下我今天现场发挥的几个发明了我觉得老实说我很喜欢发现另一个或者好多个新的自我我们每个人都有与生俱来的身体特征独特的成长经历和地理历史环境的影响但除此之外又能怎么样呢我们在多大程度上尝试过重塑自我和发现自我呢我们该如何定义自我 我们的身份又是如何可变的呢比如说 一个人在任何时候都能变成另外任何一个人 这又会怎样呢那么在接下来的这段表演中 我要呈现给大家的各个角色使得我能够用一种轻松的方式来探讨这些问题我今天把她们几个一起带来了她们都非常激动我要告诉你们她们每个人都准备了一小段TED演讲所以你们尽可以把这里想成是莎拉大学（笑声）
en:And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myselfand just talk the way I really talkbecause, after all, this is the great unveiling.And so I thought I&#39;d come up here and unveil my real voice to you.Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen&#39;s Englishbecause I am from Queens, New York.(Laughter)But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.And while I don&#39;t have any patents that I&#39;m aware of,you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.I suppose it&#39;s fair to saythat I am interested in the invention of self or selves.We&#39;re all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits,unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.But then what?To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?Well my characters, like the ones in my shows,allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.And so I&#39;ve brought a couple of them with me.And well, they&#39;re very excited.What I should tell you —what I should tell you is that they&#39;ve each prepared their own little TED talks.So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.(Laughter)

zh-cn:而且我也非常喜欢这里的多样性我发现这里汇集了多元文化当你站在这里的时候 你能见到各种各样的人这就像是一道彩虹对 没错 用”彩虹“这个词完全没有问题其实我总是反应不过来 不知道什么词能用什么词不能用什么话能说 什么话不能说要知道 我真是不想冒犯任何人好吧 不管怎样我只是觉得 跟你们在一起跟你们这些年轻人在一起而且你们当中有些是建筑师 就是要搭建我们更美好的未来的跟你们在一起让我振奋不已虽然 老实说 你们有些人做的演讲非常可怕绝对令人震惊真的 真的比如你们说的环境恶化的问题全球市场崩溃的问题当然我们都知道这一切都是因为 所有那些我真不知道还能用其他什么方法来表达 所以我就用我自己的方式来说吧都是因为那些鬼鬼祟祟偷偷摸摸的勾当（此处使用意第绪语俚语）你们也知道 这些勾当都是政府 银行和华尔街的人干的管他呢（笑声）
en:But I — I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.I noticed it&#39;s very multicultural.You know, when you&#39;re standing up here, you can see all the different people.It&#39;s like a rainbow.It&#39;s okay to say rainbow. Yeah.I just — I can&#39;t keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.What are you allowed to say or not say?I just — I don&#39;t want to offend anybody. You know.But anyway, you know,I just think that to be here with all of youaccomplished young people —literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.You know, it&#39;s heartening to me.Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying,absolutely horrifying.It&#39;s true. It&#39;s true.You know, between the environmental degradationand the crashing of the world markets you&#39;re talking about.And of course, we know it&#39;s all because of the — all the ...Well, I don&#39;t know how else to say it to you, so I&#39;ll just say it my way:the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,the bankers and the Wall Street.

zh-cn:嗨嗨感谢你们能来到这里简直太棒了我叫诺埃达 我只是能来参加TED大会我真是太高兴了这里的一切都令人激动我是多米尼加裔美国人实际上 可以说我是在多米尼加共和国的首都长大的或者说就是纽约市的华盛顿高地我不知道这里有没有其他的多米尼加人但我知道胡安恩里克斯昨天来这里了我觉得他是墨西哥人老实说 这离我已经足够近了（笑声）
en:Hi. Hi.Thank you everybody.Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.My name is Noraida. And I&#39;m just —I&#39;m so thrilled to be part of like your TED conferencethat you&#39;re doing and everything like that.I am Dominican-American.Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic,otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.But I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any other Dominican people here,but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.And I think he&#39;s Mexican, so that&#39;s —honestly, that&#39;s close enough for me right now. So —(Laughter)
时间： 6:37
zh-cn:对不起我只想尽量不要太紧张因为这个机会对我来说太难得了而且我不习惯当众演讲每当我紧张 我说话就特别快谁都听不明白我在说什么 这太打击我了你们能想像吧通常我要深呼吸让自己镇静下来但更糟糕的是 莎拉琼斯告诉我 我们总共只有18分钟于是我想也许我应该紧张点儿才好我要尽量不慌张 所以我得深呼吸
en:I just — I&#39;m sorry.I&#39;m just trying not to be nervous because this isa very wonderful experience for me and everything.And I just — you know I&#39;m not used to doing the public speaking.And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.Nobody can understand nothing I&#39;m saying, which is very frustrating for me,as you can imagine.I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.So then I&#39;m like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it&#39;s better.And I&#39;m just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.
时间： 7:01
zh-cn:好了 我想说我真的很喜欢TED我喜欢这里的一切 太不可思议了我克服不了这个（紧张情绪）说真的 人们都不相信我是从哪来的不相信居然有这么个地方我喜欢TED这个名字我知道这是个真人的名字 我只想说这居然还是个缩略语 真是太酷了这听起来非常高深我喜欢
en:Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.Like, I love everything about this. It&#39;s amazing.Like, it&#39;s — I can&#39;t get over this right now.And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I&#39;m from,that this even exists.You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the — TED.I mean I know it&#39;s a real person and everything, but I&#39;m just saying that like,you know, I think it&#39;s very cool how it&#39;s also an acronym, you know,which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.I like that.
时间： 7:28
zh-cn:事实上 我自己跟缩略语也很有关系我现在是大学二年级的学生我在学校跟几个朋友成立了一个组织也颇有领导意义就像你们一样 你们一定会喜欢这个想法的这个组织叫DA BOMB(该缩略语会被误认为“炸弹”的意思）我们的DA BOMB组织比不上你们所创造的这些（伟大的东西）DA BOMB也是个缩略语全称是多米尼加裔美国人慈善组织为了母亲和婴儿们我知道这个名字有点长但是因为反恐战争这类原因校学生活动的主任不让我们用DA BOMB这个简称让我们要用全称以避免歧义所以说 DA BOMB 这个组织我是说 多米尼加裔美国人慈善组织为了母亲和婴儿们我们努力为在学业上很有前途的学生们争取权益而且这些学生跟我一样同时也是母亲我是个母亲 但我同时要上班 还要全日制上学要知道 能找到榜样是非常重要的我知道我们的生活方式很不一样
en:And actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.Because, actually, I&#39;m a sophomore at college right now.At my school — actually I was part of co-founding an organization,which is like a leadership thing,you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.And the organization is called DA BOMB,A\and DA BOMB — not like what you guys can build and everything —it&#39;s like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican — it&#39;s an acronym —Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long,but with the war on terror and everything,the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMBand use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.So, basically like DA BOMB —what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies doesis, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promiseand who also happen to be mothers like me.I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.And, you know, it&#39;s like — it&#39;s so important to have like role models out there.I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.

zh-cn:即使在工作上（也不一样） 我刚刚获得了晋升目前我的工作让我很兴奋因为我是业务发展高级副总裁领导的副总监的初级助理这是我的新头衔但我觉得是不是有自己的公司（并不重要）像我们这样刚刚开始做一个如此重要的项目可以帮助那些想继续学习拓展他们的思想的人如果每个人都有途径获得这类机会这个世界就会大不相同 你我都知道所以我觉得我们所有人都有这个需要但我特别关注跟我一样的人我是说拉丁裔的人们 我们即将成为多数民族 大概就在两周以后所以我们应当获得跟其他人一样多的交流思想的机会因此我非常高兴你们举办了这样的活动而且还把演讲放到互联网上这太棒了 我爱这里我爱你们所有的人 我爱TED如果你们不介意的话 从今往后我个人会把TED的缩写解释成科技 娱乐和多米尼加人谢谢你们（笑声）（掌声）
en:But like even at my job — like, I just got promoted.Right now it&#39;s very exciting actually for mebecause I&#39;m the Junior Assistant to the Associate Directorunder the Senior Vice President for Business Development —that&#39;s my new title.So, but I think whether you own your own company or you&#39;re just starting out like me,like something like this is so vitalfor people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.And if everybody, like all people really had access to that,it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.So, I think all people, we need that,but especially, I look at people like me, you know like,I mean, Latinos — we&#39;re about to be the majority, in like two weeks.So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.So, I&#39;m very happy that you&#39;re, you know, doing this kind of thing,making the talks available online.That&#39;s very good. I love that.And I just — I love you guys. I love TED.And if you don&#39;t mind, privately now, in the future, I&#39;m going to think of TEDas an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.Thank you very much.(Laughter)(Applause)

zh-cn:好吧 这就是诺埃达就像珞琳和其他每一位你们今天要见到的人一样这些朋友们的原型都来自我的真实生活她们是我的朋友们邻居们和家人我来自一个多元文化的大家庭事实上 你们刚刚见到的那位老太太有那么一点点像我妈妈家的一位阿姨说来话长了 相信我但除了我（特殊）的家庭背景之外我的父母还把我送进了联合国学校在那里我结识了太多的新人包括亚历山大 我的法语老师
en:So, that was Noraida,and just like Lorraine and everybody else you&#39;re meeting today,these are folks who are based on real people from my real life:friends, neighbors, family members.I come from a multicultural family.In fact, the older lady you just met:very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother&#39;s side.It&#39;s a long story, believe me.But on top of my family background,my parents also sent me to the United Nations school,where I encountered a plethora of new characters,including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.
时间：10:21
zh-cn:要知道 那时候她教我们初级法语布松女士非常。。。（法语）要知道 在课堂上她是那种典型的法国人她很时髦很优雅 但她又十分倦怠她在课堂上给我们讲讲生命的存在徒劳无益我们当时只有11岁 这个话题不太恰当
en:Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].It was like, you know, she was there in the class,you know, she was kind of typically French.You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know,talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. (Laughter)
时间：10:54
zh-cn:但是（德语）是的 我学过三年德语（德语）这个经历很特别 因为我是班里唯一的黑人姑娘即便我上的是联合国学校但这经历很棒我的德语老师施托普先生从来没有歧视过任何人从来没有过 他一直从来都是公平对待我们每一个人让我们每一个人在课堂上都不好受
en:But [German].Yes, I took German for three years, [German],and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class,even in the UN school.Although, you know, it was wonderful.The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.Never. He always, always treated each of us,you know, equally unbearably during the class.
时间：11:21
zh-cn:好吧 这就是我的老师们 此外还有我的朋友们和来自世界各地的同学们他们中的很多人直到今天都是我非常要好的朋友他们激发了我很多创作灵感比如我的一个朋友
en:So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends,classmates from everywhere,many of whom are still dear friends to this day.And they&#39;ve inspired many characters as well.For example, a friend of mine.

zh-cn:我只想说 晚上好我的名字叫普拉文曼维 感谢你们给我这个机会TED的大名已经传遍全球我来自印度我想告诉你们莎拉琼斯告诉我 我们可以有机会来加利福尼亚参加TED大会一开始我就感到很高兴 而且老实说 松了一口气因为你们知道我是一名人权倡导者我的工作通常都要去华盛顿特区在那里我必须参加各种会议 要跟那些令人厌倦的政客打交道他们为了让我觉得舒服一些总跟我说他们在乔治城多么经常吃咖喱所以你们可以想像但我非常高兴能够参加你们的活动我希望能有更多的时间跟你们在一起 但只能下次再说啦 好吧（掌声）
en:Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.But, you know, I am originally from India,and I wanted to start by telling youthat once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunityto come here to TED in California,originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relievedbecause, you know, I am a human rights advocate.And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians,trying to make me feel comfortableby telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown. (Laughter)So, you can just imagine — right.So, but I&#39;m thrilled to be joining all of you here.I wish we had more time together, but that&#39;s for another time. Okay? Great.(Applause)
时间：12:37
zh-cn:遗憾的是 恐怕没那么多时间让我所有的朋友都跟你们见面 但是我在努力做到举止得体毕竟是我第一次来这里但我确实想让你们见一下另外几个朋友 你们应该能认出她们如果你们看过“土包子”这部舞台剧的话
en:And, sadly, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but —I&#39;m trying to behave myself,it&#39;s my first time here.But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize,if you saw &quot;Bridge and Tunnel.&quot;
时间：12:57
zh-cn:恩 谢谢大家晚上好我叫宁宝琳首先我要告诉你们我是纽约的华人社区的一员但是当莎拉琼斯让我来参加TED的时候起先我说不好 要知道如果放在两年前 我肯定不会当着这么多人讲话比这少得多的人 我也不会的因为我不太愿意作演讲因为我觉得 作为一名移民 我的英语讲不好但我又一想 我要像施瓦辛格州长一样努力尝试一下（笑声）我的女儿帮我写的发言稿她告诉我 总要以一个笑话开始演讲
en:Uh, well, thank you.Good evening.My name is Pauline Ning,and first I want to tell you that I&#39;m —of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED,I said, well, you know, first, I don&#39;t know that, you know —before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people,much less like thisbecause I did not like to give speechesbecause I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,I try anyway.(Laughter)My daughter — my daughter wrote that,she told me, &quot;Always start your speech with humor.&quot;
时间：13:57
zh-cn:关于我的背景我想简短地跟你们说一下我丈夫和我在1980年代带着我们的儿子和女儿来到这里是冲着这里的自由 当时的中国还没有这么自由我们努力教育我们的孩子要为他们的传统感到自豪 但这非常难要知道 作为移民 我会跟孩子们说中文但他们总是用英文回答我他们喜欢摇滚乐 流行文化 美国文化但当他们长大以后到了要谈婚论嫁的年龄我们就希望他们能够回归原本的文化传统但问题就出在这儿我的儿子说他还不准备结婚他有个女朋友 但她不是中国人 是美国人我不是说这下就坏事了 但我跟他说“中国姑娘有什么不好呢？”我觉得他会改变主意的
en:But my background —I want to tell you story only briefly.My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980sto have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it&#39;s very hard.You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,and they would always answer me back in English.They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.But when they got older,when the time comes for them to start think about getting married,that&#39;s when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.But that&#39;s where we had some problems.My son, he says he is not ready to get married.And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.It&#39;s not that it&#39;s bad, but I told him, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with a Chinese woman?&quot;But I think he will change his mind soon.
时间：15:01
zh-cn:之后我决定把注意力放在我女儿身上女儿的婚事对妈妈来说很特别但刚开始 她说她没兴趣她只想跟她的朋友们在一起之后在读大学的时候 她基本上就不回家了她也不愿意让我去学校看她我就想 哪里出了问题我责怪女儿有个秘密的男朋友但她告诉我说 妈妈你不用担心男孩子的问题因为我根本不喜欢他们（笑声）我就说 是的 男人是个难题 但所有的女人都要习惯的她就说 不是的 妈妈 我是说 我不喜欢男孩子 我喜欢女孩子我是个同性恋我一直教育我的孩子们要尊重美国人的想法但我跟女儿说这个问题是一个例外（笑声）她不是同性恋 她只是被这类美国问题给搞糊涂了但她跟我说 妈妈 不是美国人她说她爱上了一个中国姑娘（笑声）这些话是我想听到的但应该是从我儿子嘴里说出来 而不是我女儿（笑声）刚开始的时候 我真的不知道该怎么办但过了一段时间 我开始明白了她真的就是这样的一个人
en:So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.The daughter&#39;s marriage is very special to the mom.But first, she said she&#39;s not interested.She only wants to spend time with her friends.And then at college, it&#39;s like she never came home.And she doesn&#39;t want me to come and visit.So I said, &quot;What&#39;s wrong in this picture?&quot;So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.But she told me, &quot;Mom, you don&#39;t have to worry about boysbecause I don&#39;t like them.&quot;(Laughter)And I said, &quot;Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that.&quot;She said, &quot;No Mom. I mean, I don&#39;t like boys. I like girls.I am lesbian.&quot;So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas,but I told my daughter that this is one exception —(Laughter) —that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.But she told me, &quot;Mom, it&#39;s not American.&quot;She said she is in love — in love with a nice Chinese girl.(Laughter)So, these are the words I am waiting to hear,but from my son, not my daughter.(Laughter)But at first I did not know what to do.But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.
时间：16:43
zh-cn:即便有的时候还是很难接受我想跟你们分享的是 这件事让我认识到这个社会越来越宽容 就是因为有像TED这样的地方因为有像这样的想法像你们这样的思想开放的人我觉得TED给我们的生活带来了重大影响在不知不觉中 影响着我们所以 我要代表我女儿谢谢你们分享思想之美谢谢你们（掌声）
en:So, even though sometimes it&#39;s still hard,I will share with you that it helps me to realizesociety is more tolerant, usually because of places like this,because of ideas like this,and people like you, with an open mind.So I think maybe TED, you impact people&#39;s livesin the ways maybe even you don&#39;t realize.So, for my daughter&#39;s sake,I thank you for your ideas worth spreading.Thank you. Xie xie.(Applause)

zh-cn:晚上好 我叫哈比贝拉艾我首先要感谢莎拉琼斯因为我是她请来的唯一一位阿拉伯人 这给我很大压力而且我是最后一个发言的我来自约旦我在皇后学院教比较文学不是哈佛我感到有些不适应但我为我的学生感到骄傲我看到他们有些人来到了大会现场我保证会给你们加学分的尽管我知道我看起来不像本地人我正想说的就是 我们生活在地球村里我们之间的差异再也不像我们的长相这样差别如此大
en:Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jonesfor putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with herto be last today.I am originally from Jordan.And I teach comparative literature at Queens College.It is not Harvard.But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.But I am very proud of my students.And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.So you will get the extra credit I promised you.But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say,I do like to make the point that we in global society,we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.
时间：18:24
zh-cn:如果你们允许的话 我愿意跟你们分享一段诗这是我16岁时就会背的一首诗那么让我们回到远古年代（阿拉伯语）这段诗大致的翻译是请让我牵你的手我想牵着你的手我想牵着你的手当我抚摸你时 我内心感到幸福无比我亲爱的 我无法掩饰这情感 我无法掩饰 无法掩饰 无法掩饰好了 但是 请注意也许这诗听起来有些耳熟 因为在我人生中的同一个时期我也在听披头士的歌他们的歌在电台里很流行
en:So, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse,which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.So, back in the ancient times.[Arabic]And this roughly translates:&quot;Please, let me hold your hand.I want to hold your hand.I want to hold your hand.And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.It&#39;s such a feeling that my love, I can&#39;t hide, I can&#39;t hide, I can&#39;t hide.&quot;Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my lifelistening to the Beatles.On the radio [unclear], they were very popular.
时间：19:37
zh-cn:所以 我想说的是 我情愿相信尽管有些词语故意使得我们对彼此充耳不闻但总有动人的歌词飘进耳朵直达内心 带着韵律传遍各大洲我祈祷我们将会通过这样的方式不断实现自我发现就是这样 非常感谢你们给我这个机会好吧 很好（掌声）
en:So, all of that is to say that I like to believethat for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another,there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.That&#39;s all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.Okay? Great.(Applause)
时间：20:10

en:Thank you all very much. It was lovely.Thank you for having me.(Applause)Thank you very, very much. I love you.(Applause)Well, you have to let me say this.I just — thank you.I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.It&#39;s been a long time coming, and I feel like I&#39;m home.And I know I&#39;ve performed for some of your companiesor some of you have seen me elsewhere,but this is honestly one of the best audiences I&#39;ve ever experienced.The whole thing is amazing, and so don&#39;t you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.(Applause)
