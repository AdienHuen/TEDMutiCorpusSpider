zh-cn:我打算跟你们聊些我想 要写作的东西。我喜欢完全投入 我的研究题目。我直接切入题目 中，以自己为白老鼠。我的生活像是 一系列的实验。
en:I thought I&#39;d tell you a little about what I like to write.And I like to immerse myself in my topics.I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.And I see my life as a series of experiments.

zh-cn:几年前我为 杂志工作。我写了一篇文 章叫做&quot;我的外包生活&quot;我雇用了在印 度班加罗尔的一个团队,来过我的生 活。所以他们帮我 回电子邮件。他们帮我听电 话。他们为我和我 的老婆吵嘴，且帮我替儿子读床边故事。这是我生活中 最美好的一个月,因为我只要放 轻松，看书或看电影。这是一个很棒 的经验。
en:So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,I wrote an article called &quot;My Outsourced Life,&quot;where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,to live my life for me.So, they answered my emails.They answered my phone.They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.It was the best month of my life,because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.It was a wonderful experience.

zh-cn:到最近我为  杂志写了一篇文章叫做—关于绝对诚 实。这是个风潮 —由一位维吉尼 亚的心理学家开始的,他说人应该绝 不能说谎,除非在打牌或 是高尔夫球中例外。并且甚至，当 任何事情出现在你的脑中应该大声说出 来。我决定要来试 试看这种方式生活一个月。这是我一生 中最糟的一个月。（笑）我完全不建议 这样做。我这样讲你就 了解了，这篇文章叫 做&quot;我觉得你很胖&quot;（笑）因此，那是困难的
en:More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called —about radical honesty.And this is a movement where —this is started by a psychologist in Virginia,who says that you should never, ever lie,except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.And, more than that, whatever is on your brainshould come out of your mouth.So, I decided I would try this for a month.This was the worst month of my life.(Laughter)I do not recommend this at all.To give you a sense of the experience,the article was called, &quot;I Think You&#39;re Fat.&quot;(Laughter)So, that was hard.
时间： 1:45
zh-cn:我最新的书—我前一本书叫做《无所不知》它是关于那年我花在阅读大英百科全书从A到Z在我探寻学习世界万物中或更精确的 说从 &quot;雅乐&quot;(A-ak)一种东亚的音乐,到最后一 条&quot;日维茨&quot;(Zywiec)这是—我不想搞砸了演讲的结尾。(笑声)能够在结尾 做转折是令人兴奋的,像是欧亨利的小说,所以我不想搞砸它。但我喜欢这 想法因为那是一 个关于人脑能吸收多少信息的实验,虽然,根据凯文凯丽的说法,你只要能够在谷歌查到它就不需要记 得这件事了。所以我浪费 了点时间在这。
en:My most recent book — my previous book was called &quot;The Know-It-All,&quot;and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannicafrom A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,all the way to Zwyiec, which is — well, I don&#39;t want to ruin the ending.(Laughter)It&#39;s a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won&#39;t ruin it.But I love that one,because that was an experiment about how much informationone human brain could absorb.Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don&#39;t have to remember anything.You can just Google it.So, I wasted some time there.
时间： 2:28
zh-cn:我喜欢那些 实验,但是我觉得 最奥妙且改变生命 的实验是我最近刚完 成的实验,我花了一年的时间尝试按照圣 经上指导的原则生活—&quot;依照圣经 指导原则生活的一年&quot;并且我想这 样做有两个原因。第一我成长 在一个完全没有宗教的环境。并且如同我 书上所说, 说我是个犹太人就像&quot;橄榄 花园&quot;(美式意大利餐厅)被当成意大利餐厅，一样离谱(笑声)所以,当然 不是这样。但是我已经 对宗教越来越有兴趣。我认为, 在我们的生活中, 这是一个明确的议题,或者说是主 要的议题之一。而且我有一 个儿子。我想要知道拿什么去教他。所以我决定 投入其中，并且尝试依照圣经而活。
en:I love those experiments,but I think that the most profoundand life-changing experiment that I&#39;ve doneis my most recent experiment, where I spent a yeartrying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,&quot;The Year of Living Biblically.&quot;And I undertook this for two reasons.The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.As I say in my book, I&#39;m Jewish in the same waythe Olive Garden is Italian.(Laughter)So, not very.But I&#39;ve become increasingly interested in religion.I do think it&#39;s the defining issue of our time,or one of the main ones.And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.
时间： 3:19
zh-cn:第二个原因 我决定这样做，是因为我对基督教 基本教义的兴起有兴趣,很多人声称他们完全依 照圣经。根据调查有百分之 45或50的美国人，按着圣经的教导过生活。所以我决定 看看，真正依照圣经教导行事会怎样?我决定接受 它和它的逻辑上的推论接受一切圣 经上字面的说法,不去挑选。
en:The second reason I undertook this is becauseI&#39;m concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,religious fundamentalism, and people who saythey take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,as high as 45 or 50 percent of America.So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?I decided to take it to its logical conclusionand take everything in the Bible literally,without picking and choosing.
时间： 3:48
zh-cn:首先，我找 到一堆圣经。我有基督教 圣经。我有犹太教 圣经。我的一个朋 友送我一本叫做「嘻哈圣经」,其中诗篇第 23中所称&quot;神是一切&quot;相对的，就 我所知应该是&quot;神是我的牧者&quot;
en:The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.I had Christian bibles.I had Jewish bibles.A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, &quot;The Lord is all that,&quot;as opposed to what I knew it as, &quot;The Lord is my shepherd.&quot;
时间： 4:06
zh-cn:然后我阅读 了几个版本,并且我写下 每一我能找到的律法。这是一个很 长的清单—超过700条律法。并且这些包 含一些有名的律法一些我曾经听过的—&quot;十 戒&quot;、&quot;爱你的邻人&quot;、&quot;多结果子和生养众多&quot;。所以我要遵 循这些。我很认真执 行这个计划因为这年， 我生了双胞胎,所以我确实 认真的执行这计划。
en:Then I went down and I read several versions,and I wrote down every single law that I could find.And this was a very long list — over 700 rules.And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of —The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.So I wanted to follow those.And actually, I take my projects very seriously,because I had twins during my year,so I definitely take my projects seriously.
时间： 4:34
zh-cn:但是我想按 照这上百条在 圣经中神秘且晦涩的律法。这些是在利 未记中的律法—&quot;胡须的周 围不可损坏。&quot;我不知道哪 里是我的周围,所以我决定 留胡须,这是我最后 看起来的样子。你可想而 知,我花了很长的时间在机场安检部门。(笑声)最后的二个 月，我太太不肯亲我。所以,当然 这是一项挑战。
en:But I also wanted to follow the hundredsof arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.There is the law in Leviticus,&quot;You cannot shave the corners of your beard.&quot;I didn&#39;t know where my corners were,so I decided to let the whole thing grow,and this is what I looked like by the end.As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.(Laughter)My wife wouldn&#39;t kiss me for the last two months.So, certainly the challenge was there.
时间： 5:03
zh-cn:圣经上说， 不能穿混合纤维的衣物。所以我 想：&quot;这听起来很奇怪，但是我要试试看。&quot;你只知道如 果你尝试它。我处理掉所 有混棉的T恤。圣经上说， 如果有两个男人在打架,且其中一个 男人的太太抓另一个男人睪丸,那么她的手 就要砍断。所以,我想 要遵循这个律法。(笑声)我遵循这律 法的方式就是 —不要和人打 架，如果他的太太就站在附近的话,且她看起来 有很强的抓力。(笑声)所以— 喔,这是另一张我胡子的照片。
en:The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,so I thought, &quot;Sounds strange, but I&#39;ll try it.&quot;You only know if you try it.I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.The Bible says that if two men are in a fight,and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,then her hand shall be cut off.So, I wanted to follow that rule.(Laughter)That one I followed by default,by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,looking like she had a strong grip.(Laughter)So — oh, there&#39;s another shot of my beard.
时间： 5:47
zh-cn:我会说这是 惊奇的一年。因为这真正 是生活的改变，且是难以想象的挑战。并且还有两 种律法，特别挑战。第一是避免 一些我们每天都会犯的小错。我能够一整 年不杀生,但是一整年 不说闲话,不贪心,不说谎—我生活在纽 约，而且我是一个记者,所以我的生 活中有75至80%，要做这些。
en:I will say it was an amazing yearbecause it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.You know, I could spend a year not killing,but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying —you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.
时间： 6:14
zh-cn:但是这是很 有趣的，因为我能够做一些改善因为我起初不相信我的行为能 改变多少我的想法。这是这一 年，我学到的重大学习之一我几乎假装 成一个比较好的人,且我真的有 一点点变好。以前，我总 是认为,&quot;你改变了内心,然后行为才 会改变&quot;,但是我发现，经常是相反的。当你改变行 为,然后你改变了你的内心。所以,你知 道的,如果你想要变得更有同情心,你去医院探 望生病的人,然后你会变 得比较慈善。为某慈善事业捐 钱,然后你就放 感情在那件事里面，所以,这是 认知心里学 —认知的不一 致—这是我经历的。圣经实际上 是关于认知心里学,非常基础的 认知心里学。箴言 这样说,如果你微笑,你会变得比较快乐,就像我们知 道的一样,这是真的。
en:But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,because I couldn&#39;t believe how muchmy behavior changed my thoughts.This was one of the huge lessons of the year,is that I almost pretended to be a better person,and I became a little bit of a better person.So I had always thought, you know, &quot;You change your mind,and you change your behavior,&quot; but it&#39;s often the other way around.You change your behavior, and you change your mind.So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,you visit sick people in the hospital,and you will become more compassionate.You donate money to a cause,and you become emotionally involved in that cause.So, it really was cognitive psychology —you know, cognitive dissonance — that I was experiencing.The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,very primitive cognitive psychology.In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,which, as we know, is actually true.
时间： 7:15
zh-cn:第二种非常 难去遵循的律法是这些律法会 让我们遇到小麻烦在21世纪 的美国。一个明显的 例子是：拿石头打通奸的人。(笑声)但是，这是 圣经的很大一部份,所以我认为 我必需行出来。所以,我真 的拿石头打了一个通奸者。它发生了 —我当时在公园而且我穿着我圣经式的装扮—凉鞋和白长 袍 —你知道,因 为刚刚所说,外在影响内心。我想了解圣 经式的装扮，如何影响我的内心。然后这个男 人过来找我并说,&quot;你为什么 要穿成这样?&quot;然后我解释 我的这个计划,然后他 说：&quot;喔,我是一个奸夫,你打算拿石头打我吗?&quot;然后我 说：&quot;哇! 这很棒喔!&quot;(笑声)然后我从口 袋中拿出满手的石头那是我已经 带着这些石头几个礼拜了,期待这种情 况发生— 然后,你知道的,这些是小卵石—但是那个男 人把石头从我手中夺走。他其实是一 个年长者,七十多岁但是他仍然 是奸夫，而且看起来很生气。他把石头从 我手上夺走并且往我脸 上丢,然后我感到我能—&quot;以眼还 眼&quot;,我能报复,我就往他后背丢一个。
en:The second type of rule that was difficult to obeywas the rules that will get you into a little troublein twenty-first-century America.And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.(Laughter)But it&#39;s a big part of the Bible,so I figured I had to address it.So, I was able to stone one adulterer.It happened — I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,so sandals and sort of a white robe,you know, because again, the outer affects the inner.I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.And this man came up to me and he said,&quot;Why are you dressed like that?&quot;And I explained my project,and he said, &quot;Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?&quot;And I said, &quot;Well, that would be great!&quot;(Laughter)And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocketthat I had been carrying around for weeks,hoping for just this interaction — and, you know, they were pebbles —but he grabbed them out of my hand.He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.But he&#39;s still an adulterer, and still quite angry.He grabbed them out of my handand threw them at my face, and I felt that I could —eye for an eye — I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.
时间： 8:39
zh-cn:所以这就是 我的丢石头经验。这让我更能 严肃的谈论这些重要议题，如：为何圣经在 某些部分这么的野蛮?且又在其它 部分又难以置信的有智能?我们该如何 看待圣经?我们应该看 待它,你知道的,就当成它的本意,像是一种 Scalia(美国大法官)版本的圣经?圣经是如何 写成?然而,既然 这是一个技术集会,让我想这么 说圣经让我想 起维基百科,因为它是由许多人编辑、撰写而成的并横跨数百 年之久。撰写圣经可 以说是一种演进过程，而不是一本 从天上掉下来、已经写好的书。
en:So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow meto talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,and yet so incredibly wise in others?How should we view the Bible?Should we view it, you know, as original intent,like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?How was the Bible written?And actually, since this is a tech crowd,I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds meof the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editorsover hundreds of years.And it&#39;s sort of evolved.It&#39;s not a book that was written and came down from on high.
时间： 9:23
zh-cn:所以我想在 结尾告诉你们只是几个总结性并有意义的教训从我这一年 学来的第一个是 —诸位切莫逐字的理解圣经。这是一开始 就很清楚的。因为如果你 这样做你最终会像个疯子,拿石头丢奸 夫,或者—这里有一另个例子—好的,这是 另一个—我花了很多时间牧羊。(笑声)这是一个很 令人轻松的职业。我很推荐。
en:So I thought I would end by telling youjust a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessonsthat I learned from my year.The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.This became very, very clear, early on.Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,and stoning adulterers, or — here&#39;s another example.Well, that&#39;s another. I did spend some time shepherding.(Laughter)It&#39;s a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.
时间： 9:56
zh-cn:但这一个 是,圣经告诉我们不能碰女人在每个月的 某些时间，更甚者—你不能坐在 经期妇女曾做过的椅子。我太太觉得 这很侮辱女人,所以她把我 们家里的每一个椅子都做了一遍,所以我必须 在这一年大部分时间都站着直到我买了 一张自己的椅子并且随身携带。
en:But this one is — the Bible says that you cannot touch womenduring certain times of the month, and more than that,you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.And my wife thought this was very offensive,so she sat in every seat in our apartment,and I had to spend much of the year standinguntil I bought my own seat and carried it around.
时间：10:20
zh-cn:所以,你知 道的,我遇到一些特创论者我去了关于 特创论者的博物馆。他们是最会 咬文嚼字的人。然而这很有 趣，因为他们并不是笨蛋。我敢打赌他 们的智商，完全跟相信进化论的人一样。只是他们有 着很强的信仰执着于圣经 上的字面解释所以扭曲事 实数据，来符合他们的理论。然后他们经 由神奇的心理训练来达成。
en:So, you know, I met with creationists.I went to the creationists&#39; museum.And these are the ultimate literalists.And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.It&#39;s just that their faith is so strongin this literal interpretation of the Biblethat they distort all the data to fit their model.And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.
时间：10:48
zh-cn:然而我要说 的是,这博物馆相当华丽。他们真的完 成了一个很棒的工作。如果你曾经 去过美国肯塔基州,就是这— 你会看到一个关于大洪水的电影,他们在天花 板上装洒水器当播放到洪 水画面时，你就会被喷到水。所以,不管 你对创世纪论者看法怎样 (我是觉得这蛮疯狂)他们做了一 个很出色的工作。(笑声)
en:And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.They really did a fantastic job.If you&#39;re ever in Kentucky,there&#39;s, you can see a movie of the flood,and they have sprinklers in the ceilingthat will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.So, whatever you think of creationism — and I think it&#39;s crazy —they did a great job.(Laughter)
时间：11:13
zh-cn:另一个教训 是：诸位应当心存感恩。这是一个很 重要的教诲，因为我祷告,献上感谢, 这对于不可知论者来说 很怪。但是我嘴上 常挂着感谢,无论何时,然而我开始 改变我的看法,而且开始了 解数以百计的小事情那些顺遂的 事,那些我不曾注意到的小事。那些被当作 里所当然的—而不是去注意那些 出错的三四件事情。所以,这是 幸福的秘诀,对我来说,只要提醒自 己：当我来这里的时候车子没有翻 覆,我没被阶梯绊倒。这是件很棒 的事。
en:Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.And this one was a big lesson because I was praying,giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.But I was saying thanks all the time, every day,and I started to change my perspective.And I started to realize the hundreds of little thingsthat go right every day, that I didn&#39;t even notice,that I took for granted, as opposed to focusingon the three or four that went wrong.So, this is actually a key to happiness for me,is to just remember when I came over here,the car didn&#39;t flip over, and I didn&#39;t trip coming up the stairs.It&#39;s a remarkable thing.
时间：11:58
zh-cn:第三,诸位 应心存尊敬。这事件意外 的体会。因为我刚开始是一个不可 知论者，但是到这一年结束时我变成一个 虔敬的不可知论者。我的朋友这样叫我,我喜欢这样的称号。然而我尝试 把虔敬，变成一种风潮。所以如果有 任何人想参与,基本的构想 是,不论有没有上帝,我们都一些 重要且美好神圣想法,而且，我们 的仪式是神圣的。安息日是神 圣的。我的这一年 中的一件大事是守安息日,因为我是一 个工作狂,所以有这样一天我不能工作 —这着实改变我的生活。所以,这是 一个神圣的观念,无关于有没有神。
en:Third, that thou shall have reverence.This one was unexpected because I started the yearas an agnostic, and by the end of the year,I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.And I&#39;m trying to start it as a movement.So, if anyone wants to join,the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,there&#39;s something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,and that our rituals can be sacred.The Sabbath can be sacred.This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,because I am a workaholic, so having this one daywhere you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.
时间：12:42
zh-cn:诸位切莫墨守陈规。这个体会来 自于我花了许多 时间，参加美国各地的 不同的宗教团体，因为我希望这不 是个人的旅程，而是体验美 国宗教的经验。所以我花时 间在福音派基督教、哈西德教派，阿米绪教派。我很自豪因为，我认 为我是美国唯一能够说倒 「耶和华见证人」的人(笑声)过了三小时 半,他看着他的手表,他说：&quot;我 必须走了。&quot;(笑声)噢,非常谢 谢你。谢谢你。祝 福你,祝福你。
en:Thou shall not stereotype.This one happened becauseI spent a lot of time with various religious communitiesthroughout America because I wanted it to be morethan about my journey.I wanted it to be about religion in America.So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.I&#39;m very proud becauseI think I&#39;m the only person in Americato out Bible-talk a Jehovah&#39;s Witness.(Laughter)After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,he&#39;s like, &quot;I gotta go.&quot;(Laughter)Oh, thank you very much.Thank you. Bless you, bless you.
时间：13:22
zh-cn:但是这很有 趣因为我有一 些先入为主的想法,例如,福音派基督 教,我发现这是一个广 泛的风潮很难概括解 释。我曾遇到一 个团体叫做红字基督徒,他们聚焦于 圣经上的那些红字,那些耶稣说 过的话—在旧圣经中 被印成红字的。他们说，耶 稣没有讲过同性恋的事情。他们有一个 小册子,上面说：&quot; 这是耶稣对同性恋的说法&quot;然而当你打 开它,里面什么都没有。所以他们声 称，耶稣谈论了很多关于帮助无家可归,帮助穷人的 事。所以这对我 是很大的启发。我推荐 Jim Wallace 和 Tony Campole。他们是很能 鼓舞人心的领袖，即使我并不认同 —他们多数的 言论。
en:But it was interestingbecause I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,evangelical Christianity, and I found thatit&#39;s such a wide and varied movementthat it is difficult to make generalizations about it.There&#39;s a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,and they focus on the red words in the Bible,which are the ones that Jesus spoke.That&#39;s how they printed them in the old Bibles.And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.They have a pamphlet that says,&quot;Here&#39;s what Jesus said about homosexuality,&quot;and you open it up, and there&#39;s nothing in it.So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,helping poor people.So, this was very inspiring to me.I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.They&#39;re very inspiring leaders, even though I disagreewith much of what they say.
时间：14:25
zh-cn:还有,诸位 不能漠视无理的事。这是非常出 乎预料的。因为,你们知道,我在一个科 学的世界观中成长。然而我十分 震惊的发现，我的生命， 其实是由不理性的力量主宰。然而，如果 这些是无害的，就没必要被 完全去除。因为我学到 —我在想,我做的这些 仪式,这些圣经上的仪式,区分羊毛和 麻布质料。 我问那些虔诚的人&quot;为什么圣 经要这样告诉我们?上帝为什么在意这些?&quot;然而他们 说：&quot;我们不知道,这只是个赋 予我们意义的仪式。&quot;我说,&quot;这 很疯狂!&quot;他们会 说：&quot;噢,那你不是吗?&quot;你会吹熄生 日蛋糕上的蜡烛，这也是个仪式。如果一个来 自火星的家伙看到,他会说：&quot; 这有一个家伙吹熄蛋糕上面的火&quot;对比于另一 个不穿混纺衣服的人,火星人会 说&quot;噢,这家伙很理性,但是那家伙 很疯狂&quot;吗?不会,所 以,那些仪式是不理性的。所以,关键 是选择正确的仪式,那些无害的 仪式—仪式本身不该被去 除。
en:Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.This one was very unexpected because, you know,I grew up with the scientific worldview,and I was shocked learning how much of my lifeis governed by irrational forces.And the thing is, if they&#39;re not harmful,they&#39;re not to be completely dismissed.Because I learned that — I was thinking, I wasdoing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people&quot;Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?&quot;And they said, &quot;We don&#39;t know,but it&#39;s just rituals that give us meaning.&quot;And I would say, &quot;But that&#39;s crazy.&quot;And they would say, &quot;Well, what about you?You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here&#39;s one guyblowing out the fire on top of a cakeversus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,would the Martians say, &#39;Well, that guy, he makes sense,but that guy&#39;s crazy?&#39;&quot;So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.So the key is to choose the right rituals,the ones that are not harmful — but rituals by themselvesare not to be dismissed.
时间：15:56
zh-cn:然而,最 终,我学到：诸位应该有所选择。这是因为我想要去遵 循圣经上所有的东西。然后我失败 的很惨。因为你做不 到。你必须有所 选择,然而任何遵循圣经的人都不是照单 全收的关键是：选 择正确的部分。有一个词汇 叫做&quot;自助餐式宗教&quot;基本教义 派，把这个字用于轻蔑的意思,他们会 说：&quot;噢,这不就是自助餐式宗教罢了。你只是选自 己喜欢的去做。&quot;但我认 为：&quot;自助餐又怎样?&quot;我在自助餐 厅有吃得很开心的经验。也有难吃得 想吐的经验。所以,这是 关于选择圣经中有关恻隐之心,宽容、爱你 的邻人的那些部分,不选择「同 性恋是一种罪」、或偏狭 的,或暴力的这些部份，在圣经 里，也相当的多。所以我们 若想在这本书中找到意义,我们必须 真正投入于它,并且与它争战。
en:And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.And this one I learned becauseI tried to follow everything in the Bible.And I failed miserably.Because you can&#39;t.You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bibleis going to be picking and choosing.The key is to pick and choose the right parts.There&#39;s the phrase called cafeteria religion,and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,and they&#39;ll say, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just cafeteria religion.You&#39;re just picking and choosing.&quot;But my argument is, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with cafeterias?&quot;I&#39;ve had some great meals at cafeterias.I&#39;ve also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.So, it&#39;s about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,about tolerance, about loving your neighbor,as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,or intolerance, or violence,which are very much in the Bible as well.So if we are to find any meaning in this book,then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.
时间：17:03
zh-cn:然而结束 前我想我在说几件事。这是我正 在阅读圣经的照片。这是我如 何招呼出租车。(笑声)它是有效 的—且是的,那其实是 租来的羊,所以我必 须在早晨归还,但是牠整天都被照顾的很好。所以,不 论如何,很谢谢你们让我来演讲。
en:And I thought I&#39;d end with just a couple more.There&#39;s me reading the Bible.That&#39;s how I hailed taxicabs.(Laughter)Seriously, and it worked. And yes,that was actually a rented sheep,so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.
