zh-cn:这与州预算有关这可能是整个上午最无聊的话题但是我想告诉你们，我认为这是个重要的话题值得我们关注州预算是一大笔钱－－我给大家看这些数字－－而这些数字几乎没有经过审计这令人费解许多相关人员只看到特殊或短期的利益而忽视了这么做在将来会产生什么后果这些预算对于我们的未来至关重要它们是孩子成长的关键绝大多数教育资金－－不论是幼儿园到高中还是重点大学或社区大学－－大多数被投入这些方面的资金都是从州预算中拨出
en:Well, this is about state budgets.This is probably the most boring topicof the whole morning.But I want to tell you, I think it&#39;s an important topicthat we need to care about.State budgetsare big, big money —I&#39;ll show you the numbers —and they get very little scrutiny.The understanding is very low.Many of the people involvedhave special interests or short-term intereststhat get them not thinkingabout what the implications of the trends are.And these budgetsare the key for our future;they&#39;re the key for our kids.Most education funding —whether it&#39;s K through 12,or the great universities or community colleges —most of the money for those thingsis coming out of these state budgets.

zh-cn:但这里出了个问题这是总体的情况美国的经济非常庞大－－十四万七千亿而在这块馅饼中政府开支占了36%这是联邦政府一级－－也就是最大的这部分－－州一级、地方一级的支出总和只有从整体的角度看你才能大体了解实际的情况因为里面有许多复杂的事情如医疗保障以及研究经费在这些分界线之间但我们的支出占了36%而我们的收入是多少？简单的商业问题答案是26%那么10%的赤字就产生了有点骇人听闻在某种程度上，这是由于我们刚遭受了经济衰退的影响收入降低而一些支出项目增多然而这些并不是主要原因主要原因在于负债不断累积后果逐渐暴露因而产生了一个巨大的挑战实际上，这就是未来的发展趋势这里涉及了不同的内容可以说我们可能会筹到更多收入或着说，医疗创新的支出将增大事态越来越严重这还是在经济发展景气下的预期－－也许比实际情况要乐观一些这是从总体角度所看到的情况
en:But we have a problem.Here&#39;s the overall picture.U.S. economy is big —14.7 trillion.Now out of that pie,the government spends 36 percent.So this is combining the federal level,which is the largest,the state level and the local level.And it&#39;s really in this combined waythat you get an overall sense of what&#39;s going on,because there&#39;s a lot of complex thingslike Medicaid and research moneythat flow across those boundaries.But we&#39;re spending 36 percent.Well what are we taking in?Simple business question.Answer is 26 percent.Now this leaves 10 percent deficit,sort of a mind-blowing number.And some of that, in fact, is due to the factthat we&#39;ve had an economic recession.Receipts go down,some spending programs go up,but most of it is not because of that.Most of it is because of waysthat the liabilities are building upand the trends,and that creates a huge challenge.In fact, this is the forecast picture.There are various things in here:I could say we might raise more revenue,or medical innovation will make the spending even higher.It is an increasingly difficult picture,even assuming the economy does quite well —probably better than it will do.This is what you seeat this overall level.

zh-cn:那么我们是怎么落到这一地步的？怎么会出现这样的问题？毕竟，至少在书面上白纸黑字写着这些州政府的预算是收支平衡的只有一个州报告说他们不需要平衡预算言下之意就是其中存在猫腻根本不存在真正意义上的收支平衡但从某种意义上说，他们所玩的把戏实际上掩盖了实质问题模糊了人们的视线看不到迫在眉睫的挑战杰里·布朗当选加州州长后这些挑战就等着他来应付了通过许多不为人知的手段一份所谓的收支平衡的预算报告出炉了结果，在他所提议的760亿支出中有250亿元的空白现在他整理了一下思路：他将要削减一半的支出而另一半也许可以通过非常繁琐的一系列步骤能够通过收税来弥补但即便如此几年以后各项补贴，医疗成本都会提高而政府收入提高的幅度不够那到时候你就捉襟见肘了
en:Now how did we get here?How could you have a problem like this?After all, at least on paper,there&#39;s this notion that these state budgets are balanced.Only one state saysthey don&#39;t have to balance the budget.But what this means actuallyis that there&#39;s a pretense.There&#39;s no real, true balancing going on,and in a sense, the games they play to hide thatactually obscure the topic so muchthat people don&#39;t see thingsthat are actually pretty straight-forward challenges.When Jerry Brown was elected,this was the challenge that was put to him.That is, through various gimmicks and things,a so-called balanced budgethad led him to have 25 billion missingout of the 76 billion in proposed spending.Now he&#39;s put together some thoughts:About half of that he&#39;ll cut,another half,perhaps in a very complex set of steps,taxes will be approved.But even so,as you go out into those future years,various pension costs, health costs go up enough,and the revenue does not go up enough.So you get a big squeeze.

zh-cn:我们通过什么样的手段掩盖了这一切？一些非常高明的把戏这些把戏多少已经露出了马脚报告上说：“收支并未真正平衡。”“其中有猫腻。”“这使得赤字不断扩大。”“其中充满了骗人的把戏。”如果你仔细进行调查安然公司的那帮人绝对不会得逞这太明目张胆了太极端了难道没有人注意到这些人的所做所为吗？他们借东家补西家他们本不应这么做，但他们还是想出了对策他们让你缴纳更多税钱帮助他们周转资金他们变卖资产他们赊账他们变卖烟草的收入加利福尼亚州不是唯一的案例实际上，约有五个州的情况比加州更严重只有四个州不存在这样巨大的挑战这在整个国家已形成了体系挑战来自于某些长期的支出项目－－医学创新需要花更多的钱提早退休与养老金等问题让你对年龄结构更加头疼还有公益事业－－这些方面的假帐如果持续发展下去就会出现问题这是退休人员的医疗福利预算拨款为三百万美元，而实际负债为620亿美元－－这比汽车公司的情况遭多了不管是谁看了都知道这最终会产生巨大的问题医疗预算的走势将从预算的26%增加到42%
en:What were those things that allowed us to hide this?Well, some really nice little tricks.And these were somewhat noticed.The paper said, &quot;It&#39;s not really balanced.It&#39;s got holes.It perpetuates deficit spending.It&#39;s riddled with gimmicks.&quot;And really when you get down to it,the guys at Enron never would have done this.This is so blatant,so extreme.Is anyone paying attentionto some of the things these guys do?They borrow money.They&#39;re not supposed to, but they figure out a way.They make you pay more in withholdingjust to help their cash flow out.They sell off the assets.They defer the payments.They sell off the revenues from tobacco.And California&#39;s not unique.In fact, there&#39;s about five states that are worseand only really four statesthat don&#39;t face this big challenge.So it&#39;s systemic across the entire country.It really comes from the factthat certain long-term obligations —health care, where innovation makes it more expensive,early retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you,and just generosity —that these mis-accounting thingsallow to develop over time,that you&#39;ve got a problem.This is the retiree health care benefits.Three million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability —much worse than the car companies.And everybody looked at thatand knew that that was headed toward a huge problem.The forecast for the medical piece aloneis to go from 26 percent of the budgetto 42 percent.

zh-cn:钱从哪里来？为了照顾这一块你不得不将教育开支削减一半从某种角度来看这还真是青年人与老年人之间的利益之争如果你不改变收入状况不解决医疗保障问题你就只能减少对年轻一代的投资宏伟的加利福尼亚高校体系正在进行的各项伟大事业都将不复存在了现在，这意味着失业以及课堂规模的增大在教育界，人们在讨论“究竟应该让年轻教师下岗还是让不合格教师下岗？”还有一个讨论：如果要增大课堂规模你从何入手？这会产生多大的影响？不幸的是，你问得越多，人们就越迷惑，他们会想：“这么说，你觉得这没问题。”实际上，教育支出不应被削减如果教育支出的削减只是暂时的那么总有办法把影响减小到最低但这是个大问题另一个大问题是我们应从哪里入手技术这方面的作用非常重要而我们需要资金来进行实验才能引入那些技术我们建议根据教师的教学成效来对其支付工资对其工作进行衡量，给他们反馈为课堂录像我认为这么做非常非常重要你必须为这个制度以及激励性薪资分配资金在你的资金有所增长的情况下你把新增资金投入这一方面－－即使你的资金没有增长，你也应该从别处筹钱投入进去然而这种教育支出的削减会让我们更加难以提供激励薪资或进一步以新的方式利用技术
en:Well what&#39;s going to give?Well in order to accommodate that,you would have to cut education spending in half.It really is this young versus the oldto some degree.If you don&#39;t change that revenue picture,if you don&#39;t solve what you&#39;re doing in health care,you&#39;re going to be deinvesting in the young.The great University of California university system,the great things that have gone on,won&#39;t happen.So far it&#39;s meant layoffs,increased class sizes.Within the education community there&#39;s this discussion of,&quot;Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off,or the less good teachers who get laid off?&quot;And there&#39;s a discussion: if you&#39;re going to increase class sizes,where do you do that? How much effect does that have?And unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think,well maybe you think that&#39;s okay.In fact, no, education spending should not be cut.There&#39;s ways, if it&#39;s temporary,to minimize the impact,but it&#39;s a problem.It&#39;s also really a problem for where we need to go.Technology has a role to play.Well we need money to experiment with that,to get those tools in there.There&#39;s the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness,measuring them, giving them feedback,taking videos in the classroom.That&#39;s something I think is very, very important.Well you have to allocate dollarsfor that systemand for that incentive pay.In a situation where you have growth,you put the new money into this.Or even if you&#39;re flat, you might shift money into it.But with the type of cuts we&#39;re talking about,it will be far, far harderto get these incentives for excellence,or to move overto use technology in the new way.

zh-cn:那么情况到底怎么样？究竟是哪个幕后智囊团出了错误其实，这里根本就不存在智囊团（众人笑）这只是我们这些选民，站出来指出问题看看这些支出加州将支出1000多亿美元微软公司380亿谷歌公司约为190亿谷歌与微软内部与外部都有善于进行数据分析的这些众多分析师与相关人员—他们应该把钱花在那方面吗？不，他们把钱浪费在这里了。这个怎么样？真是太复杂了每个人都各抒己见得到的反馈巨大而这些数据对我们做出决策很有帮助如果你浏览教育支出和医疗保障支出－－尤其是这些长期的项目－－你会发现，在平等与教育这些更为重要的方面资金投入不足
en:So what&#39;s going on?Where&#39;s the brain trustthat&#39;s in error here?Well there really is no brain trust.(Laughter)It&#39;s sort of the voters. It&#39;s sort of us showing up.Just look at this spending.California will spend over 100 billion,Microsoft, 38,Google, about 19.The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis,both inside Google and Microsoftand outside, with analysts and people of various opinions —should they have spent on that?No, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? —it really is quite phenomenal.Everybody has an opinion.There&#39;s great feedback.And the numbers are used to make decisions.If you go over the education spending and the health care spending —particularly these long-term trends —you don&#39;t have that type of involvementon a number that&#39;s more importantin terms of equity, in terms of learning.

zh-cn:我们该怎么做呢？我们需要更好的工具我们可以求助于互联网我将利用我的网站来展示基本的情况我们还需要做更多工作这里有一些很有用的书其中有一本与教育支出和教育资金的来源有关－－随时间的发展，它如何变化，以及所面临的挑战我们需要更好地完成会计工作我们必须认识到我们应在当前的预算中涵盖未来将用于目前在职员工身上的支出我们必须明白他们为何以现在这样方式计算养老金这应该更像是私人会计服务这是黄金法则最后，我们需要好好奖励政治家如果他们说存在长期性问题我们不能说：“你是乌鸦嘴吗？我们一枪毙了你。”事实上，下面这几位：厄斯金·鲍尔斯，阿兰·辛普森以及其他几位他们都为州一级的联邦医疗总支出出谋划策而实际上，他们的工作并没有取得成效事实上，就在上一周他们削减了税收让情况更加恶化这超出了他们的预期我们需要继续做这些工作
en:So what do we need to do?We need better tools.We can get some things out on the Internet.I&#39;m going to use my websiteto put up some things that will give the basic picture.We need lots more.There&#39;s a few good books,one about school spending and where the money comes from —how that&#39;s changed over time, and the challenge.We need better accounting.We need to take the factthat the current employees, the future liabilities they create,that should come out of the current budget.We need to understand why they&#39;ve done the pension accountingthe way they have.It should be more like private accounting.It&#39;s the gold standard.And finally, we need to really reward politicians.Whenever they say there&#39;s these long-term problems,we can&#39;t say, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re the messenger with bad news?We just shot you.&quot;In fact, there are some like these:Erskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others,who have gone through and given proposalsfor this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off.In fact, the week afterwards,some tax cuts were donethat made the situation even worsethan their assumptions.So we need these pieces.

zh-cn:我认为这是可以得到解决的这是一个人口众多的大国我们必须吸引人们的注意力因为这事关教育大计看看加利福尼亚大学学费的变化以及未来三年，四年，五年里将进行的项目我们没有足够的资金这可是对年轻一代的投资—这是一项伟大的事业，也是我们贡献力量的机会这让我们能够成就艺术生物技术，软件技术以及其它妙不可言的事业因此，最重要的是我们必须关注州预算因为这对我们的孩子，我们的未来至关重要
en:Now I think this is a solvable problem.It&#39;s a great country with lots of people.But we have to draw those people in,because this is about education.And just look at what happened with the tuitionswith the University of Californiaand project that out for another three, four, five years —it&#39;s unaffordable.And that&#39;s the kind of thing —the investment in the young —that makes us great, allows us to contribute.It allows us to do the art,the biotechnology, the softwareand all those magic things.And so the bottom line iswe need to care about state budgetsbecause they&#39;re critical for our kids and our future.
