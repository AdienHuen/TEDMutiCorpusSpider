zh-cn:气候变化已经是一个沉重的话题并且正变得越来越沉重因为我们知道我们需要付出的比现在更多我们清楚，事实上我们之中那些生活在发达世界的人们需要切实的去推进减排的工作那已经，说的委婉一点，不能仅仅是纸上谈兵了当我们看看真实情况以及面临的巨大问题会感到有点势不可挡的感觉当棘手的问题摆在我们面前的时候我们都会试图寻找简单的解决方法我认为这就是我们现在面对气候变化的所作所为我们看到排放气体的来源—它们来自我们的排气管和烟囱等等然后我们说，恩，问题就是它们来自化石燃料的燃烧因此，解决方法一定就是把那些化石燃料换成清洁能源虽然说，毫无疑问，我们确实需要清洁能源我会向你提出如果我们把气候变化问题看做是清洁能源问题那么我们实际上让自己偏离了解决问题的正确方向
en:Climate change is already a heavy topic,and it&#39;s getting heavierbecause we&#39;re understandingthat we need to do more than we are.We&#39;re understanding, in fact,that those of us who live in the developed worldneed to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.That&#39;s, to put it mildly, not what&#39;s on the table now.And it tends to feel a little overwhelmingwhen we look at what is there in reality todayand the magnitude of the problem that we face.And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us,we tend to seek simple answers.And I think this is what we&#39;ve done with climate change.We look at where the emissions are coming from —they&#39;re coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth,and we say, okay, well the problem isthat they&#39;re coming out of fossil fuels that we&#39;re burning,so therefore, the answer must beto replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy.And while, of course, we do need clean energy,I would put to you that it&#39;s possiblethat by looking at climate changeas a clean energy generation problem,we&#39;re in fact setting ourselves upnot to solve it.

zh-cn:原因在于我们生活的星球正在快速的城市化这对我们来说已经不是什么新闻了但是，有时候我们已经很难记住城市化的程度了到本世纪中叶我们会有大约80亿—也许更多—的人口居住在城市我们将不可避免的成为城市化物种为了提供足够的能源去满足80亿人生活在城市甚至是像城市的地方像我们中现在生活在北方世界的人居住的地方我们将不得不生产出惊人数量的能源也许我们根本提供不了那么多的清洁能源因此如果我们严肃的来商讨如何在这个不断城市化的星球上阻止气候变化我们需要找到其他的解决方法
en:And the reason whyis that we live on a planetthat is rapidly urbanizing.That shouldn&#39;t be news to any of us.However, it&#39;s hard sometimesto remember the extent of that urbanization.By mid-century,we&#39;re going to have about eight billion — perhaps more — peopleliving in cities or within a day&#39;s travel of one.We will be an overwhelmingly urban species.In order to providethe kind of energy that it would takefor eight billion people living in citiesthat are even somewhat like the citiesthat those of us in the global North live in today,we would have to generatean absolutely astonishing amount of energy.It may be possiblethat we are not even ableto build that much clean energy.So if we&#39;re seriously talking about tackling climate changeon an urbanizing planet,we need to look somewhere else for the solution.

zh-cn:这个解决方法，实际上可能就近在眼前因为我们建造的所有城市都是机会在很大程度上，每座城市自身就决定了其居民使用的能源量我们趋向于把能源的使用想成一种行为方式—我选择把这盏灯关掉—但是实际上，我们居住的社区和城市的类型已经决定了我们会使用大量的能源我今天不会向大家展示太多的图表但是如果我们仔细看一下这张表的话它能展示出许多我们需要了解的东西—那就是，一个非常简单的事实如果你看一下，举个例子，交通运输一个主要的气候排放来源在城市密度和城市居民排放到空气中的废气量之间是有直接联系的它们之间的相互关系，当然了密度越大的地方趋向于低排放—如果你仔细想想，其实它并不是很难理解
en:The solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think,because all of those cities we&#39;re buildingare opportunities.Every city determines to a very large extentthe amount of energy used by its inhabitants.We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing —I choose to turn this light switch on —but really, enormous amounts of our energy useare predestinedby the kinds of communities and cities that we live in.I won&#39;t show you very many graphs today,but if I can just focus on this one for a moment,it really tells us a lot of what we need to know —which is, quite simply,that if you look, for example, at transportation,a major category of climate emissions,there is a direct relationshipbetween how dense a city isand the amount of climate emissionsthat its residents spew out into the air.And the correlation, of course,is that denser places tend to have lower emissions —which isn&#39;t really all that difficult to figure out, if you think about it.

zh-cn:基本上生活中我们会选择不同的方法完成我们想做的事情我们外出时会一跃而进我们的爱车然后驾车去往目的地通常我们选用机动性的方式去达成我们的意愿但是当我们生活在高密度的社区时我们会猛然发现，当然我们需要的东西都在我们的周围因为最绿色的出行方式是你根本就不需要出行不经意间我们的生活方式立刻变得更加绿色了增加社区的密度，当然是完全可能的
en:Basically,we substitute, in our lives,access to the things we want.We go out there and we hop in our carsand we drive from place to place.And we&#39;re basically using mobility to get the access we need.But when we live in a denser community,suddenly what we find, of course,is that the things we need are close by.And since the most sustainable tripis the one that you never had to make in the first place,suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.And it is possible, of course,to increase the density of the communities around us.

zh-cn:一些地方正在做着类似新生态区的事情正在发展一套全新的可持续发展的生活区如果你了解这项工作，你会觉得它很棒但是大多数时候，我们讨论的实际上是重新编制我们现有的城市网络因此我们更多提到的是填充式开发：即对我们现有的建筑和正在发展中事物不做明显的改变城市改造：即在我们现在已经使用的空间基础上创造出不同种的新空间和用途渐渐的，我们就会意识到我们甚至不需要去增加整个城市的密度取而代之的是促使城市平均密度达到一个我们之前没有达到的程度我们可以通过提高某些特定点的密度来达到这个目标你可以把它想成帐篷的几个支撑杆它可以切实的提高整个城市的密度
en:Some places are doing this with new eco districts,developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods,which is nice work if you can get it,but most of the time, what we&#39;re talking about is, in fact,reweaving the urban fabric that we already have.So we&#39;re talking about things like infill development:really sharp little changesto where we have buildings, where we&#39;re developing.Urban retrofitting:creating different sorts of spaces and usesout of places that are already there.Increasingly, we&#39;re realizingthat we don&#39;t even need to densify an entire city.What we need instead is an average densitythat rises to a levelwhere we don&#39;t drive as much and so on.And that can be doneby raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot.So you can think of it as tent polesthat actually raise the density of the entire city.

zh-cn:我们发现 当我们去做的时候实际上，在一个可能安逸些的广阔地区有几个真正高密度的地方就可以达到同样的结果现在我们可能会发现有些地方密度确实很大但仍然保有着他们的汽车可是实际情况是，总的来说当我们在适当的条件下把人们聚集在一起的时候，我们看到的是一个门槛效应当人们聚集在一个他们认为有家的感觉的地方的时候他们会自然的停止开车，并且渐渐地，越来越多的人都会放弃他们的车这将节省一笔非常非常可观的能源消耗因为从排气管中排放的废气仅仅是汽车业造成气候变化的开端其中还有汽车的制造，报废所有的停车场以及高速路等环节当你可以解决掉所有上述环节因为有些人根本用不到上述任何一个设施就可以切实的减少90%的交通废气的排放
en:And we find that when we do that,we can, in fact, have a few places that are really hyper-densewithin a wider fabric of placesthat are perhaps a little more comfortableand achieve the same results.Now we may find that there are places that are really, really denseand still hold onto their cars,but the reality is that, by and large,what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditionsis a threshold effect,where people simply stop driving as much,and increasingly, more and more people,if they&#39;re surrounded by places that make them feel at home,give up their cars altogether.And this is a huge, huge energy savings,because what comes out of our tailpipeis really just the beginning of the storywith climate emissions from cars.We have the manufacture of the car, the disposal of the car,all of the parking and freeways and so on.When you can get rid of all of thosebecause somebody doesn&#39;t use any of them really,you find that you can actually cut transportation emissionsas much as 90 percent.

zh-cn:人们在逐渐认同这个观点纵观全球，我们看到越来越多的人们接受了这种步行生活方式人们认为 大家的观念正在从拥有一个梦想的小家转变成拥有一个梦想的社区当你把那些我们正在普遍使用的通讯方式引入的时候你会发现，事实上我们的生活会有更多的选择其中就有一些交通选择这是Mapnificent给出的一张地图，它显示了从我家出发，在30分钟内乘坐公共交通可以走多远有一些是靠走路的，它还并不是各方面都很完美这是个谷歌的步行地图我问它如何去大Ridgeway区它告诉我通过Guernsey它并没有显示这条线路也许错过了人行路或者步行路（笑声）但是科技在不断进步这些导航工具也开始不断出现在我们周围就像我们刚刚听到的当然，我们同样正在学习如何把信息放到那些不说话的工具中放到那些无线的工具中我们正在学习如何把信息放入这些标记和导航系统之中
en:And people are embracing this.All around the world, we&#39;re seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life.People are saying that it&#39;s moving from the idea of the dream hometo the dream neighborhood.And when you layer that overwith the kind of ubiquitous communications that we&#39;re starting to see,what you find is, in fact,even more access suffused into spaces.Some of it&#39;s transportation access.This is a Mapnificent map that shows me, in this case,how far I can get from my home in 30 minutesusing public transportation.Some of it is about walking. It&#39;s not all perfect yet.This is Google Walking Maps.I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway,and it told me to go via Guernsey.It did tell me that this routemaybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths, though.(Laughter)But the technologies are getting better,and we&#39;re starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation.And as we just heard earlier,of course, we&#39;re also learning how to put information on dumb objects.Things that don&#39;t have any wiring in them at all,we&#39;re learning how to includein these systems of notation and navigation.

zh-cn:我们从中发现的部分结论是我们之前以为生产和消耗的关键点即生产出大量的产品事实上并不能让我们在高密度环境下生活得最好我们寻找的正是我们所希望的那就是让事物发挥出最大的承载力我最喜欢的例子是钻头的例子，在坐的谁家有钻头？家用型的？我也有家用型钻头在它的整个使用寿命中平均被使用6-20分钟这取决于你问的是谁因此我们做的就是买下这些实际上有着数千小时使用寿命的钻头然后用它们在墙上钻一两次洞，就把它们闲置在一边我们的城市，我会向你展示囤积了大量这样的盈余的能力于是我们尝试发现运用这些闲置能力的新方法—比如用它烹饪或者做冰雕甚至可以当凶器—我们很可能会发现实际上把这些产品转化为服务我们需要的时候就可以使用的服务这是非常明智的方法
en:Part of what we&#39;re finding with thisis that what we thoughtwas the major pointof manufacturing and consumption,which is to get a bunch of stuff,is not, in fact,how we really live best in dense environments.What we&#39;re finding is that what we wantis access to the capacities of things.My favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill, a home power drill?Okay. I do too.The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutesin its entire lifetime,depending on who you ask.And so what we do is we buy these drillsthat have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time,use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.Our cities, I would put to you,are stockpiles of these surplus capacities.And while we could try and figure outnew ways to use those capacities —such as cooking or making ice sculpturesor even a mafia hit —what we probably will findis that, in fact, turning those products into servicesthat we have access to when we want them,is a far smarter way to go.

zh-cn:事实上，甚至空间本身也正在变成一种服务我们发现人们可以共享一样的空间用闲置的空间做些事情建筑物就成了把这些服务聚集起来的地方因此我们有了新设计帮助我们把原来需要耗能的机械性设备—例如暖气和制冷装置等等—转变成无需耗能的装置我们让建筑物采用自然采光采用自然风降温 采用日光升温实际上 当我们采用这些设计时我们发现 在某些情况下建筑物的节能程度可以高达90%也带来了另一种门槛效应我称其为“抛弃锅炉”非常简单如果一个建筑本身不需要靠锅炉房供暖你就节省了一大笔资金建筑成本也因此比之前有所降低
en:And in fact, even space itself is turning into a service.We&#39;re finding that people can share the same spaces,do stuff with vacant space.Buildings are becoming bundles of services.So we have new designsthat are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on —like heating, cooling etc. —and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on.So we light our buildings with daylight.We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine.In fact, when we use all these things,what we&#39;ve found is that, in some cases,energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent.Which brings on another threshold effectI like to call furnace dumping,which is, quite simply,if you have a building that doesn&#39;t need to be heated with a furnace,you save a whole bunch of money up front.These things actually become cheaper to buildthan the alternatives.

zh-cn:现在 当我们去削减产品消耗，削减运输消耗削减建筑物本身能源消耗所有这些都很棒，但是还是有些事情需要改进如果我们想真正的成为可持续发展型城市我们需要考虑一些不同的东西这里有一个方法这是一个温哥华的宣传活动，关于他们的城市是多么环保人们的观念里已经认为一个可持续发展的城市一定是被绿色所覆盖的因此我们就有了这样的想象这样的想象，还有这样的
en:Now when we look at being ableto slash our product use, slash our transportation use,slash our building energy use,all of that is great, but it still leaves something behind.And if we&#39;re going to really, truly become sustainable cities,we need to think a little differently.This is one way to do it.This is Vancouver&#39;s propaganda about how green a city they are.And certainly lots of people have taken to heartthis idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.So we have visions like this.We have visions like this. We have visions like this.
时间： 8:30
zh-cn:这些都是很好的方案但是他们还缺少了很重要的一点缺少的不是外表的建设而且是背后的系统建设比如，他们有没有对雨水进行利用从而减少水资源消耗水是能源集中型的他们的设想是否包括了绿色的基础设施以便利于雨水的下渗和利用还可以利用生活用水清洁过滤浇灌城市植被这些方案是否可以回归到我们周围的生态系统中比如，我们周围的河流恢复它们的原貌他们是考虑到花朵的授粉提供传粉的通道从而让蜜蜂和蝴蝶之类的传粉昆虫重新回到我们的城市？甚至他们是否运用了废弃物包括食物、纤维等等物质让它们回归土壤并进行固碳即在我们使用城市的过程中把碳从空气中剥离
en:Now all of these are fine projects,but they really have missed an essential point,which is it&#39;s not about the leaves above,it&#39;s about the systems below.Do they, for instance, capture rainwaterso that we can reduce water use?Water is energy intensive.Do they, perhaps, include green infrastructure,so that we can take runoffand water that&#39;s going out of our housesand clean it and filter itand grow urban street trees?Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around usby, for example, connecting us to riversand allowing for restoration?Do they allow for pollination,pollinator pathwaysthat bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities?Do they even take the very waste matterthat we have from food and fiber and so forth,and turn it back into soiland sequester carbon —take carbon out of the airin the process of using our cities?

zh-cn:我想告诉大家所有这些方法不仅仅是可能他们正在被运用着这是非常好的事情因为现在，我们的经济运作方式总的来说就像保罗霍肯说的那样&quot;盗取将来的资源,在现在进行交易然后称其为GDP”如果再增加八十亿或是七十亿或者只是六十亿的人口如果人们仍然以透支未来的方式生活在这个星球上资源将会很快被我们所耗尽但是如果我们换个方式思考我想我们可以拥有的不仅仅是零排放的城市我们还拥有着无限的可能
en:I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible,they&#39;re being done right now,and that it&#39;s a darn good thing.Because right now, our economy by and largeoperates as Paul Hawken said,&quot;by stealing the future, selling it in the presentand calling it GDP.&quot;And if we have another eight billionor seven billion,or six billion, even, people,living on a planet where their cities also steal the future,we&#39;re going to run out of future really fast.But if we think differently,I think that, in fact, we can have citiesthat are not only zero emissions,but have unlimited possibilities as well.
