zh-cn:说说托尼 他是我的学生跟我差不多年纪他在圣昆汀州立监狱服刑在他16岁的时候有一天，“那是我妈的枪拿它吓唬吓唬这人。这家伙是个刺头他有点钱，我们拿了钱，也是给他点颜色看看。最后一刻，我想：‘我不该这么做，这不对。’同伴说：‘别拖拉了，快动手！’我说：“动手吧！”托尼会记住这三个字因为他立刻听到了响声而那个刺头躺倒在血泊里谋杀重罪终生监禁，运气好的话50岁能假释但托尼似乎不太走运
en:Meet Tony. He&#39;s my student.He&#39;s about my age,and he&#39;s in San Quentin State Prison.When Tony was 16 years old,one day, one moment,&quot;It was mom&#39;s gun.Just flash it, scare the guy. He&#39;s a punk.He took some money; we&#39;ll take his money. That&#39;ll teach him.Then last minute, I&#39;m thinking, &#39;Can&#39;t do this. This is wrong.&#39;My buddy says, &#39;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s do this.&#39;I say, &#39;Let&#39;s do this.&#39;&quot;And those three words, Tony&#39;s going to remember,because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.There&#39;s the punk on the ground, puddle of blood.And that&#39;s felony murder —25 to life, parole at 50 if you&#39;re lucky,and Tony&#39;s not feeling very lucky.

zh-cn:我们在他监狱的哲学课碰到时我说：“这门课我们讨论道德基础。”托尼打断了我“你要教我什么是是非？”我知道什么是错的。我做过错事。每一天我都知道每一天我看着面前每堵墙，我知道我错了。要是我出不去，我的名字上肯定有个污点我是个罪犯，我的标签就是‘错误’你还有什么要告诉我哪些错的哪些对的？”
en:So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prisonand I say, &quot;In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,&quot;Tony interrupts me.&quot;What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?I know what is wrong. I have done wrong.I am told every day,by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.I&#39;m a convict; I am branded &#39;wrong.&#39;What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?&quot;

zh-cn:我跟托尼说“抱歉，但你的情况比你以为的还糟你以为你知道对与错？那你能告诉我什么是错的？不要单给我例子我要知道错这个概念错是什么意思？是什么导致它是错的？我们怎么知道一件事情是错的？也许你我意见不同也许我们之一对错的理解是错的也许是你也许是我－但我们不是来交换意见的谁都有自己的意见我们是为知识而来的我们的敌人是不思考 这是哲学。”
en:So I say to Tony,&quot;Sorry, but it&#39;s worse than you think.You think you know right and wrong?Then can you tell me what wrong is?No, don&#39;t just give me an example.I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong.What is that idea?What makes something wrong?How do we know that it&#39;s wrong? Maybe you and I disagree.Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.Maybe it&#39;s you, maybe it&#39;s me — but we&#39;re not here to trade opinions;everyone&#39;s got an opinion.We are here for knowledge.Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy.&quot;

zh-cn:托尼有了改变“也许是我错了。我不想错下去了。我想知道什么是错我想知道我的想法托尼那一刻明白了哲学的概念哲学始于探究－康德所谓的“位我上者，灿烂星空；道德律令，在我心中。”人类生命能对此认知多少？哲学的概念总是将我们带回存在的问题－海德格尔所谓的“已然存在”这是个质疑我们的认知及其背后理由的概念也就是苏格拉底所说的“经过检验的生活”苏格拉底，一个知道自己一无所知的智者他死于狱中但他的哲学长存于世
en:And something changes for Tony.&quot;Could be I&#39;m wrong. I&#39;m tired of being wrong.I want to know what is wrong.I want to know what I know.&quot;What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy,the project that begins in wonder —what Kant called &quot;admiration and aweat the starry sky above and the moral law within.&quot;What can creatures like us know of such things?It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence —what Heidegger called &quot;the always already there.&quot;It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it —what Socrates called &quot;the examined life.&quot;Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.Socrates died in prison,his philosophy intact.

zh-cn:托尼开始思考他去理解他的何所来何所去，他的前因后果他的逻辑，他的谬论托尼有哲学的领悟力他身在监狱，但心却自由托尼理解了本体性混杂认识性焦虑道德可疑性和形而上学的荒谬分别是柏拉图，笛卡儿，尼采和比尔･克林顿
en:So Tony starts doing his homework.He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations,his logic, his fallacies.Turns out, Tony&#39;s got the philosophy muscle.His body is in prison, but his mind is free.Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous,the epistemologically anxious,the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous.That&#39;s Plato, Descartes, Nietzscheand Bill Clinton.

zh-cn:最后他在递交给我的期末报告里讨论了绝对命令对处理日常生活中的冲突也许是过于不妥协的态度并要我告诉他是否因此我们注定道德失灵我说：“我不知道，我们想想这个问题。”那一刻，托尼的名字上没有污点仅仅是我们两个人站在那里不是教授和罪犯仅仅是两个心灵探讨哲学我对托尼说”动手吧！“
en:So when he gives me his final paper,in which he argues that the categorical imperativeis perhaps too uncompromisingto deal with the conflict that affects our everydayand challenges me to tell himwhether therefore we are condemned to moral failure,I say, &quot;I don&#39;t know.Let us think about that.&quot;Because in that moment, there&#39;s no mark by Tony&#39;s name;it&#39;s just the two of us standing there.It is not professor and convict,it is just two minds ready to do philosophy.And I say to Tony,&quot;Let&#39;s do this.&quot;
