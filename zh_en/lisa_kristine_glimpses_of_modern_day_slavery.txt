zh-cn:我在加纳地下50米深的一个非法矿井里空气污浊闷热，充斥着尘土让人很难呼吸我可以感觉到来来往往大汗淋漓的人们从我身边擦过但是在一片黑暗中，我也看不见什么其他的东西了我听到周围有人说话的声音但更多是咳嗽声混杂着用简陋工具砸碎石头的噪音跟其他人一样，我头上顶着一个时亮时灭的廉价探照灯用一条破烂的皮筋绑在脖子上我勉强摸到墙上光溜溜的树枝扶手它们支撑着这个一米见方深上百米的井筒我的手滑了一下，立即想到数天前碰到的一名矿工他一手抓空就掉下了无底深井
en:I&#39;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana.The air is thick with heat and dust,and it&#39;s hard to breathe.I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing mein the darkness, but I can&#39;t see much else.I hear voices talking, but mostly the shaftis this cacophony of men coughing,and stone being broken with primitive tools.Like the others, I wear a flickering, cheap flashlighttied to my head with this elastic, tattered band,and I can barely make out the slick tree limbsholding up the walls of the three-foot square holedropping hundreds of feet into the earth.When my hand slips, I suddenly remember a minerI had met days before who had lost his gripand fell countless feet down that shaft.

zh-cn:在过去的28年里我一直在拍摄本土文化的纪录片走访了6大洲70多个国家而在2009年，我非常荣幸地能以独立参展商的身份出席了温哥华和平峰会在那里我遇到了很多令人倾佩的人我认识了一位Free the Slaves 非政府组织的支持者这个组织致力于根除现代社会的奴役现象我们聊起了奴隶制度而此时我才开始真正了解奴役的现实虽然我一直都知道世上奴隶制尚存但完全不知道事态的严重性在我们的谈话结束后，我感觉非常的糟糕并且为自己对这样残暴的现象缺乏认知感觉到惭愧我不知道，还有多少人也一样不知道？这个想法让我坐立难安几周后我就飞去了洛杉矶去见Free The Slaves组织的负责人，想要有所作为
en:For the last 28 years, I&#39;ve been documentingindigenous cultures in more than 70 countrieson six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honorof being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit.Amongst all the astonishing people I met there,I met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGOdedicated to eradicating modern day slavery.We started talking about slavery, and really,I started learning about slavery,for I had certainly known it existed in the world,but not to such a degree.After we finished talking, I felt so horribleand honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledgeof this atrocity in my own lifetime, and I thought,if I don&#39;t know, how many other people don&#39;t know?It started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks,I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the directorof Free the Slaves and offer them my help.

zh-cn:据保守估计当今全世界有超过2700万人被奴役这个数字是在跨大西洋奴隶贸易中从非洲被贩卖的黑奴总数的两倍150年前，一个农奴的价格抵得上美国一名普通工人年薪的三倍相当于今天的5万美金但是在今天，一整个家庭被世代奴役的代价可能就只有18美金的欠债让人震惊的是，奴隶在全球产生的利润每年超过130亿美金
en:A conservative estimate tells us there are more than27 million people enslaved in the world today.That&#39;s double the amount of people taken from Africaduring the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade.A hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slavecost about three times the annual salaryof an American worker.That equates to about $50,000 in today&#39;s money.Yet today, entire families can be enslaved for generationsover a debt as small as $18.Astonishingly, slavery generates profitsof more than $13 billion worldwide each year.

zh-cn:在印度和尼泊尔，我被带到砖窑里那里的景象极其怪异感觉就像走进了古埃及或者但丁描述的地狱在50多摄氏度的高温中男人，女人，小孩，事实上是一整个家庭在厚厚的灰尘笼罩下机械地把砖块往自己的头顶上垒每次叠上18块然后搬运到离砖窑几百米远的卡车上单调和疲惫消磨着他们他们安静着劳动着，一遍又一遍的干着同样的活一天16到17个小时中途不能休息，不能吃饭，不能喝水由于极度的缺水他们基本上也不需要上厕所由于那里面的闷热和尘土我的相机烫得没法拿也无法运转每20分钟，我就必须跑回车上清理我的设备，让它在空调底下吹着冷气它才能重新启动我坐在车上想，就连摄像机受到的待遇都比这些活生生的人要好得多
en:In India and Nepal, I was introduced to the brick kilns.This strange and awesome sight was likewalking into ancient Egypt or Dante&#39;s Inferno.Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees,men, women, children, entire families in fact,were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust,while mechanically stacking bricks on their head,up to 18 at a time, and carrying themfrom the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away.Deadened by monotony and exhaustion,they work silently, doing this task over and overfor 16 or 17 hours a day.There were no breaks for food, no water breaks,and the severe dehydration made urinatingpretty much inconsequential.So pervasive was the heat and the dustthat my camera became too hot to even touchand ceased working.Every 20 minutes, I&#39;d have to run back to our cruiserto clean out my gear and run it under an air conditionerto revive it, and as I sat there,I thought, my camera is getting far better treatmentthan these people.

zh-cn:回到窑内，我忍不住想哭但是身旁的废奴主义同伴迅速地拉住了我他说：“Lisa 别哭，别在这里哭”然后他跟我解释到在这样的地方抒发自己的情绪是很危险的不仅对我而言危险，对这些工人们也是我没有办法给他们提供任何直接的帮助我不能给他们钱，我什么也给不了我不是那个国家的公民我的行为很有可能会让他们的境遇比现在更糟我只能指望Free the Slaves组织能够在体系内发挥作用解放他们我相信他们可以做到就我来说，我必须等回到家以后才能去品尝这份心痛
en:Back in the kilns, I wanted to cry,but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed meand he said, &quot;Lisa, don&#39;t do that. Just don&#39;t do that here.&quot;And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displaysare very dangerous in a place like this,not just for me, but for them.I couldn&#39;t offer them any direct help.I couldn&#39;t give them money, nothing.I wasn&#39;t a citizen of that country.I could get them in a worse situationthan they were already in.I&#39;d have to rely on Free the Slaves to workwithin the system for their liberation,and I trusted that they would.As for me, I&#39;d have to wait until I got hometo really feel my heartbreak.

zh-cn:在喜马拉雅，我见到了做苦力的小孩背着石头走上几公里的山路到路边等着的卡车旁那些大石板比搬运石板的孩子还要重孩子们用树枝，绳子，破烂的衣服制成背带把石板绑在自己身上目睹这样沉甸甸的场景是一件极其痛苦的事我们怎么才能干预这些隐藏于舆论之外但却堪称普遍的恶事？一些人甚至都不认为他们在被人奴役每天工作十六七个小时 得不到半点酬劳因为他们生来就过着这样的日子没有任何比较如果这些人要为自己争取自由奴隶主就烧掉他们所有的房子这些人一无所有他们吓坏了，他们想要放弃但是照片中间这位女士团结众人坚持到底在当地的废奴主义者帮助他们争取采石场的租约这样，他们继续干着同样的重活但现在是为自己而干，能拿到酬劳他们拥有了自由
en:In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stonefor miles down mountainous terrainto trucks waiting at roads below.The big sheets of slate were heavierthan the children carrying them,and the kids hoisted them from their headsusing these handmade harnesses of sticks and ropeand torn cloth.It&#39;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming.How can we affect something so insidious,yet so pervasive?Some don&#39;t even know they&#39;re enslaved,people working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay,because this has been the case all their lives.They have nothing to compare it to.When these villagers claimed their freedom,the slaveholders burned down all of their houses.I mean, these people had nothing,and they were so petrified, they wanted to give up,but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere,and abolitionists on the groundhelped them get a quarry lease of their own,so that now they do the same back-breaking work,but they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it,and they do it in freedom.

zh-cn:在加德满都我由一些从前是性奴的女人随护她们带着我走下一段段狭窄的楼梯到了一个肮脏昏暗的地下室这里本身不是一间妓院它更像是间餐厅包厢餐厅在业内被人熟知是强迫卖淫的场所一个个小隔间里，性奴们女人和小孩有些只有七岁大被迫取悦客户好让他们消费更多的食物和酒每个小隔间都很暗很脏墙上画着号码由三夹板和窗帘隔开在这里工作的人通常都要忍受客人们残忍的性虐待记得当时站在几乎是一片黑暗当中我刹那间感到一阵强烈的恐惧那一刻我在想被困在这个地狱里是多么的恐怖这里只有一个出口：就是我来时走过的楼梯没有后门没有能过人的窗户这些人完全无法逃跑当我们面对如此艰难的课题重要的是要知道奴役，包括非法性交易在我们的后院里同样存在
en:In Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who hadpreviously been sex slaves themselves.They ushered me down a narrow set of stairsthat led to this dirty, dimly fluorescent lit basement.This wasn&#39;t a brothel, per se.It was more like a restaurant.Cabin restaurants, as they&#39;re known in the trade,are venues for forced prostitution.Each has small, private rooms, where the slaves,women, along with young girls and boys,some as young as seven years old,are forced to entertain the clients,encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol.Each cubicle is dark and dingy,identified with a painted number on the wall,and partitioned by plywood and a curtain.The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuseat the hands of their customers.Standing in the near darkness, I remember feelingthis quick, hot fear, and in that instant,I could only imagine what it must be liketo be trapped in that hell.I had only one way out: the stairs from where I&#39;d come in.There were no back doors.There were no windows large enough to climb through.These people have no escape at all,and as we take in such a difficult subject,it&#39;s important to note that slavery, including sex trafficking,occurs in our own backyard as well.

en:The textile industry is another one we often think ofwhen we hear about slave labor.I visited villages in India where entire families were enslavedin the silk trade.This is a family portrait.The dyed black hands are the father, while the blueand red hands are his sons.They mix dye in these big barrels,and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows,but the dye is toxic.

Go.&quot;As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vinesblocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in,found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains,so I hoisted the photo gear above my headas we descended into these waters up to my chest.After another two hours of hiking, the winding trailabruptly ended at a clearing, and before uswas a mass of holesthat could fit into the size of a football field,and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring.Many women had children strapped to their backswhile they were panning for gold,wading in water poisoned by mercury.Mercury is used in the extraction process.
