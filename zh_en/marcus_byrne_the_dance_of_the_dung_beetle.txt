zh-cn:是的，这是真的便便而我今天来就是想跟大家分享我对便便的热爱或许这很难让你接受，但是我想你大概会对这些小家伙们处理便便的方法感兴趣的。
en:This is poo,and what I want to do today is share my passionfor poo with you,which might be quite difficult,but I think what you might find more fascinatingis the way these small animals deal with poo.

zh-cn:这个小动物的脑子只有米粒那么大，但是它的能耐超过了你我的想象。基本上它所有的能耐都是围绕着它的食物也就是便便。
en:So this animal here has got a brainabout the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do thingsthat you and I couldn&#39;t possibly entertain the idea of doing.And basically it&#39;s all evolved to handle its food source,which is dung.

zh-cn:现在，该如何开始说这个故事呢？看起来从（别的动物的）排泄开始比较合适因为便便就是其它动物的排泄废物，但是它还是有营养成分的对于蜣螂（屎壳郎）而言里面的营养成分已经足够它们维持生命了所以蜣螂靠吃便便生存，它们的幼虫也靠吃便便生存。实际上它们就是在一个大粪球里长大的。在南非，人类已经发现了800种蜣螂在全非洲则发现了2000种，全球的蜣螂种类大概有6000种。所以，对蜣螂而言，便便味道是极好的。
en:So the question is, where do we start this story?And it seems appropriate to start at the end,because this is a waste product that comes outof other animals, but it still contains nutrientsand there are sufficient nutrients in therefor dung beetles basically to make a living,and so dung beetles eat dung, and their larvaeare also dung-feeders.They are grown completely in a ball of dung.Within South Africa, we&#39;ve got about 800 species of dung beetles,in Africa we&#39;ve got 2,000 species of dung beetles,and in the world we have about 6,000 species of dung beetles.So, according to dung beetles, dung is pretty good.
时间： 1:27
zh-cn:除非你下定决心用手把便便捡起来并仔细的检查，否则你可能会漏掉世界上90%的蜣螂物种，因为它们会直接钻进便便里，直直地钻下去，一直钻到地面，在地下造一个巢穴然后在便便和巢穴之间来回穿梭。
en:Unless you&#39;re prepared to get dung under your fingernailsand root through the dung itself, you&#39;ll never see90 percent of the dung beetle species,because they go directly into the dung,straight down below it, and then they shuttle back and forthbetween the dung at the soil surfaceand a nest they make underground.
时间： 1:44
zh-cn:现在的问题是，他们如何处理这些食材？大多数蜣螂都会以某种方式把便便打包。大约10%的种类会把便便裹成一个球，然后把这个粪球滚到别的地方去，经常会离发现便便的地方远一点。而它们在滚粪球这件事情上真的有一些独门绝技。现在你看到的蜣螂有一个裹的很好看的粪球。从它腿后的一小撮毛可以看得出来这是一只公蜣螂而且显然它对于自己屁股下面的东西很满意现在它马上就会遇到另一个坏蛋蜣螂成为一个被抢劫的受害者。（观众笑）这也很清楚的体现出粪球是一个价值很高的资源这么有价值的资源，需要用特殊的方法小心的看护，而我们认为蜣螂之所以要把（便便打包成）粪球推走也是因为这个原因，因为如果想要占有整个粪堆的话，打来打去是免不了的。所以这个粪堆实际上——好吧，在照片拍摄的15分钟之前它还是一个粪堆，我们认为围绕粪堆的激烈斗争造就了蜣螂非凡的滚粪球的能力。
en:So the question is, how do they deal with this material?And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.Ten percent of the species actually make a ball,and this ball they roll away from the dung source,usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source,and they have a very particular behaviorby which they are able to roll their balls.So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball.You can see it&#39;s a malebecause he&#39;s got a little hair on the back of his legs there,and he&#39;s clearly very pleased about what he&#39;s sitting on there.And then he&#39;s about to become a victimof a vicious smash-and-grab. (Laughter)And this is a clear indicationthat this is a valuable resource.And so valuable resources have to be looked afterand guarded in a particular way, and we thinkthe reason they roll the balls away is because of this,because of the competition that is involvedin getting hold of that dung.So this dung pat was actually — well, it was a dung pat15 minutes before this photograph was taken,and we think it&#39;s the intense competitionthat makes the beetles so well-adaptedto rolling balls of dung.

zh-cn:你可以把蜣螂的旅程想象成穿越非洲大草原。它的头是朝下的，而且是倒着走。最古怪的地方是蜣螂如何能够控制粪球的方向，同时还需要防止自己的头被烤熟了。这是非洲，非常的热，
en:So what you&#39;ve got to imagine here is this animal heremoving across the African veld.Its head is down. It&#39;s walking backwards.It&#39;s the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction,and at the same time it&#39;s got to deal with the heat.This is Africa. It&#39;s hot.
时间： 3:27
zh-cn:现在我要跟大家分享的是我自己和我的同事做过的一些实验我们研究了蜣螂是如何处理这些问题的。
en:So what I want to share with you noware some of the experiments that myself and my colleagueshave used to investigate how dung beetlesdeal with these problems.
时间： 3:39
zh-cn:看这些蜣螂，我希望你注意到两个细节。一是它如何处理我们放在路上的障碍物。看，像是跳舞一样，然后它继续照着它一开始的方向前进，分毫不差。一小段舞蹈，然后又冲着一开始的方向。非常明显这个小东西有方向感而且知道要往哪里去。这是非常、非常重要的一件事情你自己想想看，你站在粪堆上，你现在有了一个粪球，而你想要它离别的蜣螂远远的，最快的转移路线就是一条直线。于是我们做了更多的实验，我们把蜣螂脚下的地皮挪了挪位置，然后看它的反应。现在蜣螂所在的一小块范围已经被我们转了90度。它毫不畏惧，它清楚知道要往哪里走，而且它转向了一个特定的方向。
en:So watch this beetle,and there&#39;s two things that I would like you to be aware of.The first is how it deals with this obstaclethat we&#39;ve put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance,and then it carries on in exactly the same directionthat it took in the first place.A little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction.So clearly this animal knows where it&#39;s goingand it knows where it wants to go,and that&#39;s a very, very important thing,because if you think about it, you&#39;re at the dung pile,you&#39;ve got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else,and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line.So we gave them some more tasks to deal with,and what we did here is we turned the worldunder their feet. And watch its response.So this animal has actually had the whole worldturned under its feet. It&#39;s turned by 90 degrees.But it doesn&#39;t flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go,and it heads off in that particular direction.
时间： 4:47
zh-cn:我们第二个问题是它们怎么做到的？它们做了什么？有一条可能的线索。它们经常需要爬到粪球的顶端这样它们可以看到周边的环境。这时候你可能会想它们爬上了粪球之后能看到什么东西？周围有什么“标志性建筑”让蜣螂能够指引自己的方向？而最明显的地标应该就是天空了。我们接着想，现在（大白天）它们看天上能看到什么？最显眼的就是太阳。于是我们做了一个经典实验，我们移动了太阳的位置。我们现在用一块板把太阳遮起来再用一块镜子把太阳挪到另外一个位置。然后我们看这些蜣螂怎么办。它调整了一下，然后转到了跟原先的前进路线完全相反的方向。这是怎么回事？这很明显的证明了它们靠太阳认路。对它们来说太阳是天上很重要的一个指引。
en:So our next question then was,how are they doing this?What are they doing? And there was a cue that was available to us.It was that every now and then they&#39;d climb on top of the balland they&#39;d take a look at the world around them.And what do you think they could be looking atas they climb on top of the ball?What are the obvious cues that this animal could useto direct its movement? And the most obvious oneis to look at the sky, and so we thought,now what could they be looking at in the sky?And the obvious thing to look at is the sun.So a classic experiment here,in that what we did was we moved the sun.What we&#39;re going to do now is shade the sun with a boardand then move the sun with a mirrorto a completely different position.And look at what the beetle does.It does a little double dance,and then it heads back in exactly the same directionit went in the first place.What happens now? So clearly they&#39;re looking at the sun.The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.
时间： 5:51
zh-cn:可是是太阳并不是一直挂在天上，日落之后太阳就在地平线以下了。在日落之后天空中充满了大量的偏振光这是我们人类的眼睛所看不到的。现在太阳在远处的地平线上我们知道太阳在地平线下时我们假设在这个位置这是北极和南极，偏振光沿着这条长长的路线贯穿天空我们的眼睛看不到它们但是蜣螂可以看到。我们怎么证明这点？其实不难，我们找到一个很大的偏振光滤镜，把它罩在蜣螂上面，把偏振光滤镜调整到跟大气中的偏振光对应的角度蜣螂从我们的滤镜下面出来了右转了一下因为它重新看到了没有被过滤的天空于是它就又可以把自己的路线调整到最初的前进方向上。这个实验证明了蜣螂可以看到偏振光。
en:The thing is the sun is not always available to you,because at sunset it disappears below the horizon.What is happening in the sky hereis that there&#39;s a great big pattern of polarized light in the skythat you and I can&#39;t see. It&#39;s the way our eyes are built.But the sun is at the horizon over hereand we know that when the sun is at the horizon,say it&#39;s over on this side,there is a north-south, a huge pathway across the skyof polarized light that we can&#39;t seethat the beetles can see.So how do we test that? Well, that&#39;s easy.What we do is we get a great big polarization filter,pop the beetle underneath it, and the filter is at right anglesto the polarization pattern of the sky.The beetle comes out from underneath the filterand it does a right-hand turn,because it comes back under the skythat it was originally orientated toand then reorientates itself backto the direction it was originally going in.So obviously beetles can see polarized light.
时间： 7:03
zh-cn:现在，让我们回顾一下，蜣螂做什么事情？它们滚粪球。怎么滚粪球？它们沿着直线滚。它们怎么能滚出一条直线来？它们通过天上的太阳和偏振光线索进行定位。有些线索我们人类看不见。
en:Okay, so what we&#39;ve got so far is,what are beetles doing? They&#39;re rolling balls.How are they doing it? Well, they&#39;re rolling them in a straight line.How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line?Well, they&#39;re looking at celestial cues in the sky,some of which you and I can&#39;t see.
时间： 7:20
zh-cn:但是它们是怎么感知到天上的各种天体信息的？这是我们就接下来要关心的。我们关心的就是这段舞蹈（调整方向的过程），我们相信这个行为很重要，你看它每次都会停下来，调整一下然后朝着它想去的方向推进。所以问题是它们在跳舞（调整）的时候做了什么？在它们重新调整方向之前我们能够误导它们多远？在这个实验中，我们铺了一段管道让蜣螂不知不觉的走入这个特殊的管道这个管道一点一点的让蜣螂改变方向，最终让它转了180度的大弯跟它刚进管道时的方向恰恰相反。我们来看看它的反应：现在它跟原来的方向偏了90度，现在它正要——它在这里停了下来，它已经跟原先的方向偏差了180度。看它的反应它跳了一小段舞，它转了过来，它开始往回推。它清楚的知道自己在干嘛。它清楚的知道哪里出了问题，它也清楚的知道怎么处理这个问题。而这种舞蹈本身就是调整自己的动作。让它们可以重新确定方向。
en:But how do they pick up those celestial cues?That was what was of interest to us next.And it was this particular little behavior, the dance,that we thought was important, because look,it takes a pause every now and then,and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in.So what are they doing when they do this dance?How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?And in this experiment here, what we did was we forced theminto a channel, and you can see he wasn&#39;tparticularly forced into this particular channel,and we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degreesuntil this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite directionthat it wanted to go in, in the first place.And let&#39;s see what his reaction isas he&#39;s headed through 90 degrees here,and now he&#39;s going to — when he ends up down here,he&#39;s going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction.And see what his response is.He does a little dance, he turns around,and heads back in this. He knows exactly where he&#39;s going.He knows exactly what the problem is,and he knows exactly how to deal with it,and the dance is this transition behaviorthat allows them to reorientate themselves.
时间： 8:35
zh-cn:这就是蜣螂的舞蹈，但是我们花了这么多年蹲在非洲那么热的灌木丛中观察蜣螂我们除了发现蜣螂的舞蹈是用来调整方向我们还发现了舞蹈的另一个用途。时不时的，每当它们爬上粪球的顶端时，它们都会擦自己的脸。再看一次，现在我们想，它这是在干什么？现在地面很烫，而当地表很烫的时候，它们跳舞就跳得频繁。当它们跳这种舞蹈时，它们会擦自己的脸的底部我们猜想这可能属于体温调节的行为。我们猜想它们之所以这么做是想要把脸上滚烫的沙子擦掉并涂点吐沫在自己头上降温。
en:So that&#39;s the dance, but after spending many yearssitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days,we noticed that there was another behaviorassociated with the dance behavior.Every now and then, when they climb on top of the ball,they wipe their face.And you see him do it again.Now we thought, now what could be going on here?Clearly the ground is very hot, and when the ground is hot,they dance more often, and when they do this particular dance,they wipe the bottom of their face.And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior.We thought that maybe what they&#39;re doing is trying toget off the hot soil and also spitting onto their faceto cool their head down.
时间： 9:20
zh-cn:于是我们设计了两个实验场。一个温度很高，一个温度不高。我们遮起来这一块地，另一块什么也没遮。接下来我们用热成像摄像头去拍摄蜣螂。你现在看到的是我们实验的热成像图你可以注意到在图像中粪球的温度很低。所以事实上就是，当你从温度的角度来看便便太酷了（酷和冷都是“cool”）（观众笑）
en:So what we did was design a couple of arenas.one was hot, one was cold.We shaded this one. We left that one hot.And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera.So what you&#39;re looking at here is a heat imageof the system, and what you can see here emergingfrom the poo is a cool dung ball.So the truth is, if you look at the temperature over here,dung is cool. (Laughter)
时间： 9:53
zh-cn:当然我们最感兴趣的还是比较地表的温度和蜣螂的温度差异。地表的温度大概是50摄氏度左右，蜣螂和粪球的温度大概处在30到35摄氏度这个范围。所以对于正在穿越炎热的“非洲大草原”的蜣螂而言，粪球就是个巨无霸冰淇淋。它没有爬上粪球也没有跳舞，因为它的温度已经相对较低了。它的体温跟你我都差不多。值得注意的是它的小脑袋温度非常的低。但是如果同样的事情发生在炎热的环境中，看看这边地表的温度，大概在55到60摄氏度之间。注意看蜣螂开始频繁的跳舞。注意它的前腿，非常的热。粪球提供了一个降温场所，我们认为蜣螂之所以爬上粪球，擦自己的脸是为了让自己凉快一些，并把前进过程中沾上的热沙去掉。
en:So all we&#39;re interested in here is comparing the temperatureof the beetle against the background.So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade.The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about30 to 35 degrees centigrade,so this is a great big ball of ice creamthat this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld.It isn&#39;t climbing. It isn&#39;t dancing, becauseits body temperature is actually relatively low.It&#39;s about the same as yours and mine.And what&#39;s of interest here is that little brain is quite cool.But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment,look at the temperature of the soil.It&#39;s up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.Watch how often the beetle dances.And look at its front legs. They&#39;re roaringly hot.So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow,and the beetle climbs on top of the balland wipes its face, and all the time it&#39;s trying to cool itself down,we think, and avoid the hot sand that it&#39;s walking across.
时间：11:00
zh-cn:然后我们给蜣螂穿上了特制的小鞋子，希望搞清楚蜣螂是不是用它的前腿来检测地表的温度。看这里你能发现，穿了鞋子的蜣螂比没穿鞋子的爬上粪球的次数要少了很多。我们叫这些小鞋子为“清凉靴”。鞋子的原料是从一个牙印胶膜上剪的，我们还把它们的粪球放在冰箱里面冷冻，给蜣螂提供一个冰爽可口的冰淇淋粪球，我们发现相比热腾腾的粪球，它们爬上粪球的次数少了很多。这种手法叫“踩高跷”。这跟你我穿过沙滩时避免脚被烫到的行为是类似的，我们跳上一条毛巾，不知道谁的毛巾 ——“抱歉，我踩到了你的毛巾。”——然后你又跳到另一个人的毛巾上，这样你就不会烫到自己的脚了。蜣螂也是这么做的。
en:And what we did then was put little boots on these legs,because this was a way to test if the legswere involved in sensing the temperature of the soil.And if you look over here, with boots they climb onto the ballfar less often when they had no boots on.So we described these as cool boots.It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots.And we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were ableto put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball,and they climbed onto that ball far less oftenthan when they had a hot ball.So this is called stilting. It&#39;s a thermal behaviorthat you and I do if we cross the beach,we jump onto a towel, somebody has this towel —&quot;Sorry, I&#39;ve jumped onto your towel.&quot; —and then you scuttle across onto somebody else&#39;s towel,and that way you don&#39;t burn your feet.And that&#39;s exactly what the beetles are doing here.
时间：11:51
zh-cn:我还有一个好玩的事情要跟你们分享，关于这个特别的品种。这个物种属于“Pachysoma”属。“Pachysoma”属包含13个不同的物种，它们有种行为很特别，我想你会很感兴趣。看这只蜣螂，注意看它在干嘛。你看到不同了么？它们运动的比看起来要快很多，现在是慢速播放。它在向前走，事实上它随身带了一个粪丸子。虽然这是同一属中不同的物种，但是觅食行为都是完全一致的。
en:However, there&#39;s one more story I&#39;d like to share with you,and that&#39;s this particular species.It&#39;s from a genus called Pachysoma.There are 13 species in the genus, and they havea particular behavior that I think you will find interesting.This is a dung beetle. Watch what he&#39;s doing.Can you spot the difference?They don&#39;t normally go this slowly. It&#39;s in slow motion.but it&#39;s walking forwards,and it&#39;s actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it.This is a different species in the same genusbut exactly the same foraging behavior.
时间：12:30
zh-cn:这只蜣螂还有一个有意思的地方就是它会建立巢穴并存储粮食，这让我们觉得很神奇。注意看这只，它正打算做一个窝。然后它不满意它一开始选的地方，它找到了第二个地段50分钟后，窝建好了。然后它开始外出寻找食物并囤积了大量的粪丸子。我想让你注意的是它出去的路径和回来的时候走的路径。对比一下。从总体上看，你会意识到它回家的路线要比外出的路线更加像是直线。当外出觅食时，它总是东张西望的寻找新的便便。回家的路上，它知道家在哪里，而且它想走直线回家。这点很重要，与其它绝大多数蜣螂的单向旅程不同，这只蜣螂的需要在食物来源和自己的巢穴之间反复来回。注意看，另一场发生在南非的犯罪行为正在进行。（观众笑）它的邻居偷了它的一个粪丸子。
en:There&#39;s one more interesting aspect of thisdung beetle&#39;s behavior that we found quite fascinating,and that&#39;s that it forages and provisions a nest.So watch this individual here, and what he&#39;s trying to dois set up a nest.And he doesn&#39;t like this first position,but he comes up with a second position,and about 50 minutes later, that nest is finished,and he heads off to forage and provisionat a pile of dry dung pellets.And what I want you to notice is the outward pathcompared to the homeward path, and compare the two.And by and large, you&#39;ll see that the homeward pathis far more direct than the outward path.On the outward path, he&#39;s always on the lookoutfor a new blob of dung.On the way home, he knows where home is,and he wants to go straight to it.The important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip,as in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeatedback and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site.And watch, you&#39;re going to seeanother South African crime taking place right now. (Laughter)And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.
时间：13:44
zh-cn:我们刚才观察到的行为称为“路径整合（path integration）”。这个的意思是说蜣螂知道巢穴的位置，它沿着弯弯绕绕的路线寻找食物，一旦它找到了食物，它沿着直线返回巢穴。它清楚的知道家在哪里。有两种方式可以做到这一点，我们可以通过挪动蜣螂巢穴位置的办法来确定它使用的是哪种方式。如果它使用的是地标信息，那么它会找到自己的巢穴；反之如果使用的是路径整合，它就会找不到，跑到一个错误的位置去。在这里使用“路径整合”的意思是指它记得走过的步数或走过的距离。它知道家的方向，知道应该往那里走。如果巢穴被挪动，它将会走到错误的地方。现在我们来看看这个蜣螂在相似的实验中如何反应。
en:So what we&#39;re looking at hereis a behavior called path integration.And what&#39;s taking place is that the beetlehas got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted pathlooking for food, and then when it finds food,it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.Now there&#39;s two ways it could be doing that,and we can test that by displacing the beetleto a new position when it&#39;s at the foraging site.If it&#39;s using landmarks, it will find its home.If it is using something called path integration,it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot,and what it&#39;s doing here if it&#39;s using path integrationis it&#39;s counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.It knows the bearing home, and it knows it should be in that direction.If you displace it, it ends up in the wrong place.So let&#39;s see what happens when we put this beetleto the test with a similar experiment.
时间：14:43
zh-cn:这就是我们狡猾的实验员它转移了蜣螂，我们看看接下来会发生什么这是一个巢穴，食物就放在里面。食物被移动到了一个新的位置如果它使用的地标导向它应该可以找到巢穴因为它能够识别洞穴周围的地标如果它使用的是路径整合它应该跑到一个错误的地方去
en:So here&#39;s our cunning experimenter.He displaces the beetle,and now we have to see what is going to take place.What we&#39;ve got is a burrow. That&#39;s where the forage was.The forage has been displaced to a new position.If he&#39;s using landmark orientation,he should be able to find the burrow,because he&#39;ll be able to recognize the landmarks around it.If he&#39;s using path integration,then it should end up in the wrong spot over here.
时间：15:14
zh-cn:现在让我们来考验一下蜣螂看看会发生哪种情况。现在它跑到了那里它本打算冲着巢穴的方向，但是看看结果。丢人啦。它没有头绪。它开始寻找巢穴的地点跟食物来源的相对距离是正确的但是显然它已经彻底迷路了。现在我们知道这种蜣螂是通过路径整合来找到回家的路，但是我们无情的实验员把它骗到了左上角然后抛弃了它。（观众笑）
en:So let&#39;s watch what happenswhen we put the beetle through the whole test.So there he is there.He&#39;s about to head home, and look what happens.Shame.It hasn&#39;t a clue.It starts to search for its house in the right distanceaway from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.So we know now that this animal uses path integrationto find its way around, and the callous experimenterleads it top left and leaves it. (Laughter)
时间：15:53
zh-cn:所以我们现在看到的这些动物它们会辨方向，它们使用太阳作为自己的指南针来寻找它们的路，它们还拥有某种形式上的距离测算系统我们知道这些动物能够记住自己走过的步数它们用步数统计作为自己的里程表来找到它们回家的路。我们还不知道蜣郎是怎么做到的。
en:So what we&#39;re looking at here are a group of animalsthat use a compass, and they use the sun as a compassto find their way around,and they have some sort of systemfor measuring that distance,and we know that these species here actuallycount the steps. That&#39;s what they use as an odometer,a step-counting system, to find their way back home.We don&#39;t know yet what dung beetles use.
时间：16:20
zh-cn:我们从这种动物脑袋只有米粒那么大的动物身上能够学习到什么？嗯，我们知道它们能借助天空中的天体线索沿直线推球我们知道它们的舞蹈是一种定向行为也是一种温度控制行为我们还知道它们使用路径整合系统来找到它们回家的路。所以，从这种成天跟便便打交道的小动物身上我们可以学习到很多令人敬畏的技能这些技能是你我都做不到的。谢谢大家。（鼓掌）
en:So what have we learned from these animalswith a brain that&#39;s the size of a grain of rice?Well, we know that they can roll balls in a straight lineusing celestial cues.We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behaviorand it&#39;s also a thermoregulation behavior,and we also know that they use a path integration systemfor finding their way home.So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substancewe can actually learn an awful lot from these thingsdoing behaviors that you and I couldn&#39;t possibly do.Thank you. (Applause)
