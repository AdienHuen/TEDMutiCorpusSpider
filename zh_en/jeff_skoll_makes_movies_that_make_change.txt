zh-cn:其实我一直在电话旁边等着TED给我打电话，这么多年2000年我准备好讲eBay......但是没有电话2003年我准备了一个讲演关于“Skoll基金会”和“社会创业”。没有电话。2004年我创立了“参与者制作公司”而且第一年我们成绩卓著，还是没有电话到了去年我终于接到了一个电话可是我又得排在J.J. Abrams 后面（笑声）TED的幽默感很残酷（笑声）
en:I&#39;ve actually been waiting by the phonefor a call from TED for years.And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.In 2003, I was ready to do a talkabout the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.In 2004, I started Participant Productionsand we had a really good first year, and no call.And finally, I get a call last year,and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.(Laughter)You&#39;ve got a cruel sense of humor, TED.(Laughter)

zh-cn:我最初从硅谷来到好莱坞时心理面又很多疑惑 15 00:00:44,000 —&gt; 00:00:47,000 但我发现在好莱坞有很多好处但我发现在好莱坞有很多好处（笑声）拥有自己的传媒公司也有其好处我还发现好莱坞和硅谷比我想象的具备更多相通之处好莱坞有它的性感标志，硅谷也有它的性感标志（笑声）好莱坞有它的对手们，硅谷也有自己的对手们好莱坞有自己的“权力圆桌”硅谷有“桌面足球”所以这两者有很多共同之处比我想象的多很多
en:When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,I had some misgivings.But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.(Laughter)And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valleyhave a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.(Laughter)Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.Hollywood gathers around power tables,and the Valley gathers around power tables.So it turned out there was a lot more in commonthan I would have dreamed.

zh-cn:但我今天在这里要讲述一个故事一部分是关于我个人的故事。当Chris邀请我演讲的时候，他说人们觉得我—有点捉摸不透他们想知道我的动力是什么我真正的动力是—一个关于未来的设想对我们所有人都有意义一个和平繁荣和可持续的世界我们听过那么多演讲在过去的几天里有艾德·威尔逊和詹姆斯·那希维的照片大家都看到了去实现人类的下一次“飞跃”的距离我把它称为 “人类2.0”这是存在于我们每个人内心的愿望去纠正当今世界上两个最大的错误
en:But I&#39;m actually here today to tell a story.And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,and they want to know what drives you a bit.And what really drives me is a vision of the futurethat I think we all share.It&#39;s a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.And when we heard a lot of the presentationsover the last couple of days,Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,I think we all realized how far we have to goto get to this new version of humanitythat I like to call &quot;Humanity 2.0.&quot;And it&#39;s also something that resides in each of us,to close what I thinkare the two big calamities in the world today.

zh-cn:一是“机会鸿沟”这也是昨晚克林顿总统所说的“不平等，不公正和不可持续”的鸿沟这又滋生了贫穷，文盲，疾病和我们身边的一切罪恶然而更大的那个鸿沟也许是我们所谓的“希望鸿沟”不知道哪里出来的这种坏思想说普通人不可能对世界产生任何影响我觉这种想法很可怕所以第一章从今天开始，从我们开始因为我们每个人都有能力填平“机会鸿沟”和“希望鸿沟”如果连TED的人们都无法改变这世界，不知还有谁能
en:One is the gap in opportunity —this gap that President Clinton last nightcalled uneven, unfair and unsustainable —and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and diseaseand all these evils that we see around us.But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad ideathat an ordinary individual couldn&#39;t make a difference in the world.And I think that&#39;s just a horrible thing.And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,because within each of us is the power toequal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.And if the men and women of TEDcan&#39;t make a difference in the world, I don&#39;t know who can.

zh-cn:对于我，这一切始于幼年时代家人常常去纽约州北部露营那儿的夏天实在是无所事事，除了被我姐姐暴打，或者读书我那时阅读的作者有詹姆斯·米切内詹姆斯·克拉维尔和安·兰顿在他们的故事里世界是一个狭小的而又相互关联的地方我当时想如果我能写点儿东西描述这个世界的狭小与相互关联也许能激发人们对那些影响我们的事情感兴趣一起行动起来促进变革
en:And for me, a lot of this started when I was youngerand my family used to go camping in upstate New York.And there really wasn&#39;t much to do there for the summer,except get beaten up by my sister or read books.And so I used to read authors like James Michenerand James Clavell and Ayn Rand.And their stories made the world seem a very smalland interconnected place.And it struck me that if I could write storiesthat were about this world as being small and interconnected,that maybe I could get people interested in the issuesthat affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.

zh-cn:我知道那并非谋生的最佳手段因此我决定先走上寻求财务自由之路以便能尽早写出这些故事到了14岁的时候有件事对我影响很大一天我父亲回到家跟我说他患了癌症，情况很糟他说他害怕的不是死亡而是他还没有完成那些他想做的事情老天保佑，许多年后的今天他仍然活着但对一个年轻人来说那是个刻骨铭心的经历一个人永远都无法知道你还有多少时间因此我有了很强烈的紧迫感，我学了工程专业我创立了几家个公司我想那会给我带来财务上的自由
en:I didn&#39;t think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.And my dad came home one dayand announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.And what he said was, he wasn&#39;t so much afraid that he might die,but that he hadn&#39;t done the things that he wanted to with his life.And knock on wood, he&#39;s still alive today, many years later.But for a young man that made a real impression on me,that one never knows how much time one really has.So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.I started a couple of businessesthat I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.

zh-cn:其中有一个公司做的是电脑租赁生意名叫移动微米这是个很贴切的名字因为有人不断地偷电脑（大笑）我想我得多学学怎么做生意我就去了斯坦福商学院在那儿我结识了一个朋友名叫皮埃尔·欧米得亚，他今天到场了。皮埃尔，我向你致歉这是一张很久以前的照片就在我刚刚毕业的时候，皮埃尔来找我他有一个想法可以帮助人们在网上买卖东西带着斯坦福学位赋予我的智慧我说:“皮埃尔，这是一个多么愚蠢的主意!”（大笑）不用说我是对的（大笑）
en:One of those businesses was a computer rental businesscalled Micros on the Move,which is very well named,because people kept stealing the computers.(Laughter)So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.And while I was there, I made friends with a fellownamed Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologizefor this. This is a photo from the old days.And just after I&#39;d graduated, Pierre came to mewith this idea to help peoplebuy and sell things online with each other.And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,I said, &quot;Pierre, what a stupid idea.&quot;(Laughter)And needless to say, I was right.(Laughter)

zh-cn:但那之后不久，1996年，皮埃尔和我就辞去了我们的全职工作创立了eBay, 剩下的故事，你们都知道了。公司两年后上市今天它是全球最知名的企业之一几百个国家上亿人在使用它……但对我个人而言，这是个真正的变化。我从在Palo Alto 和五个男人合租一套房子靠他们的剩菜剩饭过活后来，突然之间我拥有了一切资源于是就想如何能将这些财富带来的恩赐与全世界分享
en:But right after that, Pierre — in &#39;96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobsto build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.The company went public two years laterand is today one of the best known companies in the world.Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.But for me, personally, it was a real change.I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Altoand living off their leftovers,to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.And I wanted to figure out how I couldtake the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.

zh-cn:就在那会儿我认识了约翰·加德纳他是一个很了不起的男人他曾是“大社会”计划的建筑师在1960年代林登·约翰逊总统的领导下我问他，我能做的最好的事是什么或者是任何人能做的最好的事情去改变世界上长期困扰人类的问题约翰说：“去帮助好人做好事帮助好人做好事”他的话让我产生了强烈的共鸣
en:And around that time, I met John Gardner,who is a remarkable man.He was the architect of the Great Society programsunder Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,or anyone could do, to make a differencein the long-term issues facing humanity.And John said, &quot;Bet on good people doing good things.Bet on good people doing good things.&quot;And that really resonated with me.

zh-cn:结果我创立了一个基金会来帮助那些好人们做好事情那些具有创新精神，不求名利的领导者用他们的商业智慧和各种有力方式解决社会问题现在被我们称为“社会企业家”举几个例子，比如像Mohammed Yunus建立了格莱珉银行使世界上一亿多人口摆脱了贫困获得了诺贝尔和平奖。还有许多像他这样奉献却不为人知的人比如安·克顿在非洲创立了女性教育组织，因为她觉得非洲女性教育十分落后。她在大约10年前创办了这个组织，到今天，她已经为超过25万的非洲女性提供了教育还有，像维多利亚·黑尔博士她创办了世界上第一个非盈利的制药公司他生产的第一批药用来治愈内脏利什曼病这种病也被称为“黑热病”她希望在2010年能完全消灭这种在发展中国家造成灾难的疾病而这些都是帮助好人做好事的例子
en:I started a foundationto bet on these good people doing good things.These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,who are using business skills in a very leveraged wayto solve social problems.People today we call social entrepreneurs.And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,who started the Grameen Bank,has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,won the Nobel Peace Prize.But there&#39;s also a lot of people that you don&#39;t know.Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,because she felt girls&#39; education was lagging.And she started it about 10 years ago,and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,who started the world&#39;s first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,also known as black fever.And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,which is really a scourge in the developing world.And so this is one way to beton good people doing good things.

zh-cn:这些事情组成了“变革”的哲学它们具有很大的影响力这就是“投入，联络，庆祝”投入，就是说，当你发现别人在做好事情的时候给他们投入，帮助壮大他们的组织或是在商业世界中，给予他们资金支持通过会议和他们相识，产生联系就像TED一样把大家联系起来或者是“社会企业家世界论坛”它是我在牛津大学的基金会每年的活动之一庆祝他们的成功，给别人讲述他们的事迹这不仅是庆祝他们做的好事情而是他们的所作所为能够帮助填平“希望的鸿沟”
en:And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of changethat I find really is powerful.It&#39;s what we call, &quot;Invest, connect and celebrate.&quot;And invest: if you see good people doing good things,invest in them. Invest in their organizations,or in business. Invest in these folks.Connecting them together through conferences —like a TED — brings so many powerful connections,or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurshipthat my foundation does at Oxford every year.And celebrate them: tell their stories,because not only are there good people doing good work,but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.
时间： 7:55
zh-cn:这就是这个任务中最后的部分“庆祝”它使我想起我小时候的事情，我想把这件事说给大家能听，让所有人都能参与到这些与我们休戚相关的事情中来我想第一盏灯是写作事实上我并不需要亲自动笔，我只要找一个代笔下一盏灯是比写作更好的东西比如说，电影、电视可以在更大程度上影响人们我可以想到那些给我力量的电影如《甘地》和《辛德勒名单》我开始思考现在还有谁在做这样的电影事实上，并没有哪家公司是专注于公共事业的
en:And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,that really got me back to thinking when I was a kidand wanted to tell stories to get people involvedin the issues that affect us all.And a light bulb went off,which was, first, that I didn&#39;t actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?And I thought about the films that inspired me,films like &quot;Gandhi&quot; and &quot;Schindler&#39;s List.&quot;And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.And there really wasn&#39;t a specific companythat was focused on the public interest.

zh-cn:所以在2003年，我在洛杉矶开始建立一个专注社会利益的媒体公司并得到了很多&quot;鼓励&quot;其中一句&quot;鼓励&quot;激励过我很多次是：“好莱坞的大街上到处都是你们这种自以为来了就会拍电影的失败者。”当然了，还有另外的说法，“要成为一个百万富翁的最保险的办法就是让一个亿万富翁做电影行业。”（笑声）
en:So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angelesto talk about the idea of a pro-social media companyand I was met with a lot of encouragement.One of the lines of encouragementthat I heard over and over was,&quot;The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,who think you&#39;re going to come to this town and make movies.&quot;And then of course, there was the other adage.&quot;The surest way to become a millionaireis to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business.&quot;(Laughter)

zh-cn:虽然危言耸听，在2004年1月，我还是创立了“参与者制作公司”希望他能成为一个全球性的媒体公司并专注于公共利益。我们的任务是通过拍摄电影，来激发和促进社会变革我们不想让人们看到我们的电影之后一笑而过，我们是想让大家参与到这些社会问题中来2005年，我们发行了第一批纪录影片，《轮椅上的竞技》《北方风云》《辛瑞那》和《晚安, 好运》，出乎我的意料，它们被公众注意到了，
en:Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productionswith the vision to be a global media companyfocused on the public interest.And our mission is to produce entertainmentthat creates and inspires social change.And we don&#39;t just want people to see our moviesand say, that was fun, and forget about it.We want them to actually get involved in the issues.In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,&quot;Murder Ball,&quot; &quot;North Country,&quot; &quot;Syriana&quot;and &quot;Good Night and Good Luck.&quot;And much to my surprise, they were noticed.

zh-cn:我们最终因为这些影片获得了11项奥斯卡奖的提名那一年对我们来说真是意义重大但更重要的是千千万万的人们加入到了我们的倡议活动和积极的实践中来，这些活动都是围绕着我们的电影来的然后我们成立了网站，我们的网络社区域名是Participate.net我们社会领域的搭档，比如说ACLU, PBS,Sierra俱乐部和NRDC，一旦人们看了电影，就会知道他们可以去做些事情，改变世界
en:We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.Perhaps more importantly,tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programsand the activism programsthat we created to go around the movies.And we had an online component of that,our community sect called Participate.net.But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and theSierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,there was actually something they could do to make a difference.

zh-cn:这其中有一部叫做《决不让步》这部电影可以说是票房灾难但这部由查理兹·塞隆主演的电影内容包括了女人的权力，权力的赋予家庭暴力等在我们发行这部电影的同时国会正在讨论延续防止对妇女施暴法案随着电影走上银屏，被观众所谈论并且通过我们的社会领域的搭档比如“世界妇女组织”这部电影有了广泛的影响力并影响到了该法案的修正这对我来说，是很有分量的事情，因为它是一部讲述真实生活的电影关于一个被性骚扰的女人，起诉她的老板，成为了一个标志性的案件，催生了《机会均等法》《反对妇女暴力法》等法律的诞生因为这部电影讲述的这个故事促成了这些伟大法律的修正那我们再次回到帮助好做好事的主题上
en:One of these films in particular, called &quot;North Country,&quot; was actuallykind of a box office disaster.But it was a film that starred Charlize Theronand it was about women&#39;s rights, women&#39;s empowerment,domestic violence and so on.And we released the film at the same time thatthe Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,and with our social sector partners,like the National Organization of Women,the film was widely creditedwith influencing the successful renewal of the act.And that to me, spoke volumes, because it&#39;s —the film started about a true-life storyabout a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,and the Violence Against Women Act and others.And then the movie about this person doing these things,then led to this greater renewal.And so again,it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.

zh-cn:说到了TED的同志们，我想提一下戈尔我第一次看见戈尔做演讲是在2005年5月，主题是全球变暖那时，我想自己对全球变暖了解一些认为这只是30—50年左右的问题但是看了他的演讲之后我才知道，事态紧急当时我赶紧去后台找到戈尔先生当时在场的还有劳伦斯·班德，劳里·大卫，和戴维斯·古根海姆，戴维斯当时就在Participant执导纪录片在戈尔的大力支持之下，我们当场决定把他的演讲拍成电影我们觉得，这样就可以把戈尔的信息传达给全世界而比他去世界各地演讲一次面对100或200个观众要快很多
en:Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al —I first saw Al do his slide show presentationon global warming in May of 2005.At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.And after we saw his slide show,it became clear that it was much more urgent.And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, andwith Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,and Davis Guggenheim,who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.And with Al&#39;s blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,because we felt that we could get the message out therefar more quickly than having Al go around the world,speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.

zh-cn:大家知道，在好莱坞还有一句名言“人们多少都会了解一些东西”我想这真的是对于慈善事业最好的宣传。它也让我们很震惊当电影真正抓住了公众的兴趣现在它是英格兰，苏格兰的学生们必看的电影在斯堪的纳维亚地区也广泛流传我们给美国的高中老师送出了五万张DVD它改变了人们对全球变暖的讨论这一年对戈尔来说也是非常有意义的戈尔现在被称为全球变暖方面的乔治克鲁尼（笑声）
en:And you know, there&#39;s another adage in Hollywood,that nobody knows nothing about anything.And I really thought this was going to bea straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.And so it was a great shock to all of uswhen the film really captured the public interest,and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,and most of Scandinavia.We&#39;ve sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.and it&#39;s really changed the debate on global warming.It was also a pretty good year for this guy.We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.(Laughter)

en:And for Participant, this is just the start.Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.And we have 10 films in production right now,and dozens others in development.I&#39;ll quickly talk about a few coming up.One is &quot;Charlie Wilson&#39;s War,&quot; with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.And it&#39;s the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, andhow he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.And we&#39;re also doing a movie called &quot;The Kite Runner,&quot;based on the book &quot;The Kite Runner,&quot; also about Afghanistan.And we think once people see these films,they&#39;ll have a much better understanding of that part of the worldand the Middle East in general.

en:In closing, I&#39;d like to say that everybody has the opportunityto make change in their own way.And all the people in this roomhave done so through their business lives,or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.And one thing that I&#39;ve learnedis that there&#39;s never one right way to make change.One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,but every one of us is all of those things and more.
