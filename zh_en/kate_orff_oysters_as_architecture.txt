zh-cn:我热爱美国的山河也热爱我们的地貌从加州的中央山谷...到曼哈顿地底基岩地貌塑造了我们的历史与品性但很明显就在过去百年内我们…这是美国城市扩张图...我们有计划地改造自然地表削平，多样性消失结果我们忘记了...与周围动植物的关系也忘记了...与脚下土地的关系我工作的意义在于尝试重新构想这些关系并将其重新建立此图表示这个人工环境...为我们带来了哪些问题问题确实很多城市人口增长生物多样性丧失当然还有海平面上升以及气候变化
en:I am passionate about the American landscapeand how the physical form of the land,from the great Central Valley of Californiato the bedrock of Manhattan,has really shaped our history and our character.But one thing is clear.In the last 100 years alone,our country — and this is a sprawl map of America —our country has systematicallyflattened and homogenized the landscapeto the point where we&#39;ve forgottenour relationship with the plants and animalsthat live alongside usand the dirt beneath our feet.And so, how I see my work contributingis sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connectionsand physically rebuild them.This graph represents what we&#39;re dealing with nowin the built environment.And it&#39;s really a confluxof urban population rising,biodiversity plummetingand also, of course, sea levels risingand climate changing.

zh-cn:所以我考虑设计方案时就会去思考如何发挥创意改变这些曲线改善这些问题图上的箭头代表现在这个时间点城市化与生态学...可以说泾渭分明我试着将二者合而为一以崭新的方式融合到一起大搞基建的时代结束了这种大工程由政府牵头功能单一，耗资巨大实在解决不了问题我们需要新工具、新方法建筑理念也是如此就像这种东西根本不考虑周围景观绝对无法...不好意思这东西太扎眼了...我们不需要这种东西因此我们要构建新理念引入新角色，采用新工具
en:So when I also think about design,I think abouttrying to rework and re-engagethe lines on this graphin a more productive way.And you can see from the arrow hereindicating &quot;you are here,&quot;I&#39;m trying to sort of blend and meldthese two very divergent fieldsof urbanism and ecology,and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way.So the era of big infrastructure is over.I mean, these sort of top-down,mono-functional, capital-intensive solutionsare really not going to cut it.We need new tools and new approaches.Similarly, the idea of architectureas this sort of object in the field,devoid of context,is really not the —excuse me, it&#39;s fairly blatant —is really not the approachthat we need to take.So we need new stories,new heroes and new tools.

zh-cn:下面我就给大家介绍帮我们对抗气候变化的英雄它就是美东牡蛎别看它个儿小一点也不起眼本事可是十分惊人因为牡蛎能聚到一起形成巨大的礁状结构能够增殖，所以可以养殖忘了说了，它味道也挺好我在纽约港做了一个项目算是宣示我的城市设计理念这个项目就以牡蛎为基础叫做“蛎之理”“蛎之理”的核心理念在于借助贻贝、鳗草、牡蛎借各种港口水生生物的力量与此同时也借助当地居民的力量共同努力改变现在的环境
en:So now I want to introduce you to my new heroin the global climate change war,and that is the eastern oyster.So, albeit a very small creatureand very modest,this creature is incredible,because it can agglomerateinto these mega-reef structures.It can grow; you can grow it;and — did I mention? — it&#39;s quite tasty.So the oyster was the basisfor a manifesto-like urban design projectthat I did about the New York Harborcalled &quot;oyster-tecture.&quot;And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological powerof mussels, eelgrass and oysters —species that live in the harbor —and, at the same time,harness the power of peoplewho live in the communitytowards making change now.

zh-cn:这是我家乡纽约市的地图红色区域是被水淹没的部分圈住的部分是我要讲的...郭瓦纳斯运河和总督岛请看这张地图蓝色的部分...都属于水域黄色的部分是陆地凭直觉大家就能看出纽约港本来多样而立体疏浚平整后却成了烂泥一堆这都是在短短几年内发生的再看几张运河的实景图我得承认，现在运河臭得很污水过度排放水体污染但是我也得说几乎每个城市都有这种情况大家都面临这个问题此图反映的就是这个问题黄色绿色代表污染物由于风暴潮、海水上升污染更加恶化所以说我们问题确实很多
en:Here&#39;s a map of my city, New York City,showing inundation in red.And what&#39;s circled is the site that I&#39;m going to talk about,the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island.If you look here at this map,showing everything in blueis out in the water,and everything in yellow is upland.But you can see, even just intuit, from this map,that the harbor has dredged and flattened,and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muckin really a matter of years.Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself.Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly — I will admit it.There are problems of sewage overflowand contamination,but I would also argue that almost every cityhas this exact condition,and it&#39;s a condition that we&#39;re all facing.And here&#39;s a map of that condition,showing the contaminants in yellow and green,exacerbated by this new flow ofstorm-surge and sea-level rise.So we really had a lot to deal with.

zh-cn:我们开始做这个项目时一个核心理念就是回顾历史了解过去发生了什么这是1770年的地图大自然的鬼斧神工在图上清晰可见既有港外的一连串岛屿又有纵横交错的盐沼滩涂对于陆上居民来说盐沼滩涂是天然防波堤我们还了解到当时运河产的牡蛎足有餐碟那么大因此我们的理念是“回到未来”汲取前人建筑方面的智慧这一理念要分两步走第一要发展人工生态学港外要有礁石这样可以保护运河保护内陆新建居民区如果水质改善，水流减缓人与水就能以全新方式共存
en:When we started this project,one of the core ideas was to look back in historyand try to understand what was there.And you can see from this map,there&#39;s this incredible geographical signatureof a series of islandsthat were out in the harborand a matrix of salt marshes and beachesthat served as natural wave attenuationfor the upland settlement.We also learned at this timethat you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner platein the Gowanus Canal itself.So our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept,harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern.And the idea has two core stages.One is to develop a new artificial ecology,a reef out in the harbor,that would then protect new settlement patternsinland and the Gowanus.Because if you have cleaner water and slower water,you can imagine a new way of living with that water.

zh-cn:我们想创造性解决三个核心问题水质、风暴潮、海水上升现在回到环保英雄牡蛎身上这种动物真是不可思议从一端吸入藻类腐屑再经过它神奇的消化器官最后从另一端排除的...却是净化了的水一只牡蛎一天能过滤189升水纽约港的¼...都有牡蛎礁覆盖几天就能滤好全港的水我们的文化和经济都离不开牡蛎基本上纽约的缔造者就是采牡蛎的人街道都铺在牡蛎壳上这张图呢是卖牡蛎的小车现在跟热狗摊一样到处都有本来是好好的东西我们却只拿来填饱肚子最后，牡蛎可以将身体...变得稀薄，互相粘合形成这些惊人的天然礁石它是大自然的防波堤而对所有港口而言它又是生态系统的基石许许多多物种都依存于牡蛎
en:So the project really addresses these three core issuesin a new and exciting way, I think.Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster.And again, it&#39;s this incredibly exciting animal.It accepts algae and detritus in one end,and through this beautiful, glamorousset of stomach organs,out the other end comes cleaner water.And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day.Oyster reefs also coveredabout a quarter of our harborand were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days.They were key in our culture and our economy.Basically, New York was builton the backs of oystermen,and our streets were literally built over oyster shells.This imageis an image of an oyster cart,which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today.So again, we got the short end of the deal there.(Laughter)Finally, oysters can attenuateand agglomerate onto each otherand form these amazing natural reef structures.They really become nature&#39;s wave attenuators.And they become the bedrockof any harbor ecosystem.Many, many species depend on them.

zh-cn:牡蛎启发了我们的项目但其生命周期也给了我新灵感几个星期之内牡蛎就能从受精卵变成...到处漂游的幼体随时可以互相粘合再变成成年的雌雄个体我们以人类的视野范围重新解读其生命周期整条郭瓦纳斯运河可看成巨型牡蛎育儿所牡蛎在运河里长大幼年阶段循流而下然后再在湾脊礁繁殖因此我们的核心概念就是从头开始逐渐重建生态系统创造清洁可再生...又生机勃勃的环境
en:So we were inspired by the oyster,but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.It can move from a fertilized eggto a spat, which is when they&#39;re floating through the water,and when they&#39;re ready to attach onto another oyster,to an adult male oyster or female oyster,in a number of weeks.We reinterpreted this life cycleon the scale of our sightand took the Gowanusas a giant oyster nurserywhere oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus,then paraded down in their spat stageand seeded out on the Bayridge Reef.And so the core idea herewas to hit the reset buttonand regenerate an ecology over timethat was regenerative and cleaningand productive.

zh-cn:那么牡蛎礁的原理是什么呢？非常非常简单其中一个核心概念就是要想解决气候变化问题就不能等着天上掉馅饼与其花200亿美元不如利用现有资源从现在做起，从眼前做起这是一大片防波桩连接桩子的是这种毛绒绒的编织绳你可能会问这是什么绳其实是很平常的东西一般五金店就能买到，很便宜试想一下我们自个儿烤些蛋糕卖卖了的钱就够我们开项目了（笑声）我们在工作室里不画图纸而是学怎么编绳子把绳子编好就可以为牡蛎的生长提供崭新柔软的温床这幅图大家可以看到这项工程如何渐渐演变为全新的城市公共空间它可以因应气候变化不断发展变化
en:How does the reef work? Well, it&#39;s very, very simple.A core concept hereis that climate changeisn&#39;t something that —the answers won&#39;t land down from the Moon.And with a $20 billion price tag,we should simply start and get to work with what we have nowand what&#39;s in front of us.So this image is simply showing —it&#39;s a field of marine pilesinterconnected with this woven fuzzy rope.What is fuzzy rope, you ask?It&#39;s just that; it&#39;s this very inexpensive thing,available practically at your hardware store, and it&#39;s very cheap.So we imagine that we would actuallypotentially even host a bake saleto start our new project.(Laughter)So in the studio, rather than drawing,we began to learn how to knit.The concept was to really knit this rope togetherand develop this new soft infrastructurefor the oysters to grow on.You can see in the diagram how it grows over timefrom an infrastructural spaceinto a new public urban space.And that grows over time dynamicallywith the threat of climate change.

zh-cn:同时这项工程也孕育了...这个跨水陆的新型公共空间这样人们的工作休闲都会以全新方式进行我们最后发觉这项工程...其实是新型的“蓝绿”水上公园专为下一个水世纪打造可以叫做“两栖公园”穿好凉鞋来这儿享受吧！想象一下你可以在这里潜水这是一群高中生，准备潜水这项工程他们也参与其中大家可以想象一种全新生活方式人与水之间建立全新的关系同时一举两得把休闲娱乐和科研监测结合起来
en:It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think,new amphibious public space,where you can imagine working,you can imagine recreating in a new way.In the end, what we realized we were makingwas a new blue-green watery parkfor the next watery century —an amphibious park, if you will.So get your Tevas on.So you can imagine scuba diving here.This is an image of high school students,scuba divers that we worked with on our team.So you can imagine a sort of new manner of livingwith a new relationship with the water,and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programsin terms of monitoring.

zh-cn:在这个美丽的新世界里还有个新玩意——上飘器这是“上涌飘浮器”的简称这种装置很棒很简易基本就是个飘浮的筏子牡蛎在底下生长海水搅动，流过筏子边上有八个箱子养殖牡蛎并强行给它们喂食这样我们牡蛎的数量不是十个八个，而是上万然后牡蛎又可以繁殖运河的未来是这样的河岸有这种筏子用我们的话说就是“上飘化”当地居民可以在河边看到牡蛎的养殖过程想想看，到时候满河尽是木筏荡漾小牡蛎沿河而下去筑礁我们在岸上欢呼，多好玩啊！
en:Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world:this is the word &quot;flupsy&quot; —it&#39;s short for &quot;floating upwelling system.&quot;And this glorious, readily available deviceis basically a floating raftwith an oyster nursery below.So the water is churned through this raft.You can see the eight chambers on the sidehost little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.So rather than having 10 oysters,you have 10,000 oysters.And then those spat are then seeded.Here&#39;s the Gowanus futurewith the oyster rafts on the shorelines —the flupsification of the Gowanus.New word.And also showing oyster gardening for the communityalong its edges.And finally, how much fun it would beto watch the flupsy paradeand cheer on the oyster spatsas they go down to the reef.

zh-cn:有人问过我两个问题一是何时能看到你们的成果二是什么时候能吃上牡蛎我的回答是，耐心地等一等但我们计算过可能到了2050年大家就能享用牡蛎了
en:I get asked two questions about this project.One is: why isn&#39;t it happening now?And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?And the answer is: not yet, they&#39;re working.But we imagine, with our calculations,that by 2050,you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.

zh-cn:总而言之，我所讲到的只是一座城市的一个剖面而我的梦想与希望在于大家回到各自家乡以后我们能携起手来同心协力改造重建城市景观打造一个更符合可持续发展观...更宜居、还有美味可以享用的未来！
en:To conclude, this is just one cross-sectionof one piece of city,but my dream is, my hope is,that when you all go back to your own citiesthat we can start to work together and collaborateon remaking and reforminga new urban landscapetowards a more sustainable, a more livableand a more delicious future.
