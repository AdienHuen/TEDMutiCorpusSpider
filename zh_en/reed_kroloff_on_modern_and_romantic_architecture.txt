en:To be new at TED — it&#39;s like being the last high-school virgin.(Laughter)You know that all of the cool people are — they&#39;re doing it.And you&#39;re on the outside, you&#39;re at home.You&#39;re like the Raspyni Brothers,where you&#39;ve got your balls in cold water. And —(Laughter) —you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.And you&#39;re on the inside, and it&#39;s everything you hoped it would be.It&#39;s exciting and there&#39;s music playing all of the timeand then suddenly it&#39;s over. And it&#39;s only taken five minutes.And you want to go back and do it again.But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris,and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.

zh-cn:所以我今天要讲一点关于建筑的东西是在创作和乐观主义的范畴内如果你把创作(creation)和乐观主义(optimism)两个词放一块儿你有两个能谈的东西一个是“神创论”（creationism) —我不觉得在你们这些听众里有什么市场至少你们不会是铁杆支持者—或者你可以谈优化设计(optimisations), 用英式拼法的s而不是z这个就是我今天想说的可是任何一种关于建筑的谈话—比如现在我们在说着的搭一个TED会场，小规模建筑—似乎总不能避免谈到这个：世贸中心和那边在进行的事情，它对我们的意义
en:So anyway, today we&#39;ll talk about architecture a little bit,within the subject of creation and optimism.And if you put creation and optimism together,you&#39;ve got two choices that you can talk about.You can talk about creationism —which I think wouldn&#39;t go down well with this audience,at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it —or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z.And I think that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to talk about today.But any kind of conversation about architecture —which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here,setting up TED, small-scale architecture —at the present time can&#39;t really happen without a conversation about this,the World Trade Center, and what&#39;s been going on there, what it means to us.

zh-cn:因为如果建筑是象我所理解的是我们文化野心的筑成品而现在你有个机会改善一个情况它正代表着另外一群人针对我们的文化野心你现在有机会从头再来，你会做什么？这事在很长时间里令人激动不已我觉得世贸中心用一种挺不幸的方式吸引了人们对建筑的兴趣人们很久没有这样思考过建筑了日常谈话里也很少触及我做建筑和写评论20年，也想不起来哪一次人们让我在桌边坐下问我一些严肃的问题：分区，火灾逃生通道安全问题，还有地毯会不会引火我们从前不经常说这些的可是现在大家总是大谈特谈直到要把房子全副武装你突然要对建筑另眼相看了现在我们就用新的眼光审视建筑就得这样想
en:Because if architecture is what I believe it to be,which is the built form of our cultural ambitions,what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situationthat represents somebody else&#39;s cultural ambitions relative to us?And our own opportunity to make something new there?This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way,brought architecture into focusin a way that I don&#39;t think people had thought of in a long time,and made it a subject for common conversation.I don&#39;t remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture,a time when five people sat me down at a tableand asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting,safety concerns and whether carpet burns.These are just not things we talked about very often.And yet, now, it&#39;s talked about all the time.At the point where you can weaponize your buildings,you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way.And so now we&#39;re going to think about architecture in a very different way,we&#39;re going to think about it like this.

zh-cn:你们中多少人今天看了《今日美国》？这就是这是世贸中心地段，印在封面上有关部门挑了挑然后选了Daniel Libeskind的设计（TED上有其演讲—译者注）当代建筑领域的可怕顽童曾经的钢琴神童，他从六角手风琴玩起然后找了一个正经些的事情，一个大些的乐器现在又转到更大的乐器上来展示他独此一家的解构主义魔法如你所见他是六个受邀参加竞标的设计师之一从前有六个公司都已经退出了这些人的东西愚蠢陈腐到了极点以至于连纽约市政府都不得不说噢，实在是抱歉，我们搞砸了好。我们能不能还是自上而下地做只是这次用哪怕有一丁点才气的人而不是先前弄进来的六个大白痴那些通常规划我们城市的房地产商的狗腿子是时候让货真价实的建筑师来改变一下情况了然后就有了这个，那个也是备选的。不要鼓掌！
en:How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that.There&#39;s the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.They&#39;ve made a selection.They&#39;ve chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,and now to an even larger instrument,upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,as you see here.He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,after six previous firms struck outwith things that were so stupid and banalthat even the city of New York was forced to go,&quot;Oh, I&#39;m really sorry, we screwed up.&quot;Right. Can we do this again from the top,except use some people with a vague hint of talent,instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.Let&#39;s bring in some real architects for a change.And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.

zh-cn:太晚了。这个没希望了这是一个叫THINK(思考)的团队的方案，他们总部在纽约而这个是Libeskind的方案它被选中即将成为新的世贸中心地上一个大洞，大楼一个个栽在里面我不知道你们怎么看，但我觉得这个决定挺傻的因为这无非造久了一个永久性的毁灭纪念碑让建筑看起来仿佛在无限期地自毁，永不停止可是我们就得建这玩意儿了但我想让你想想这些东西把它当作美国建筑业持续奋斗的表现这两个东西总是被很明确地说到就是我们选择建筑师时考虑的两个方面是想要我们的建筑物产生于技术流的问题解决方案—创造一个解决所有问题的技术答案无论社会问题、物理的、化学的—或者是找一个浪漫主义的解决方案
en:It&#39;s too late. That is gone.This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.Now, I don&#39;t know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,because what you&#39;ve done is just made a permanent memorial to destructionby making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.But that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do.But I want you to think about these thingsin terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,and that these two things talk about very specifically.And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,in trying to decide whether we want architecturefrom the kind of technocratic solution to everything —that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,be they social, be they physical, be they chemical —or something that&#39;s more of a romantic solution.

zh-cn:我说的“浪漫主义”不是指某个地方用来约会不错我的意思是“浪漫”指有些东西比我们要伟大、壮丽在美国传统中技术流与浪漫主义的区别就像托马斯·杰佛逊的横跨合众国的笛卡尔式坐标系留给我们几乎是所有西部州的版图形状这是个真正的，技术流的办法，一种—在杰佛逊的时代—是一种对当时流行的理性主义哲学的服膺要不，就像我们在那个时代之后的评价—“天定命运”看看你们更喜欢什么？一个坐标系，还是“天定命运”？“天定命运”
en:Now, I don&#39;t mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.So, in the American tradition,the difference between the technocratic and the romantic,would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson&#39;sCartesian grids spreading across the United States,that gives us basically the whole shapeof every western state in the United States,as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the —in Jefferson&#39;s time — current, popular philosophy of rationalism.Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?Manifest destiny.

en:It&#39;s a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don&#39;t we?Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved onethe moment they saw one.And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.

zh-cn:我们天性中就喜欢在技术流的答案和一种更壮观的，浪漫式的意象之间反复跳跃所以切入正题麻烦关一下灯可以吗？我会很简短地介绍一下两位建筑师他们代表着当今建筑界的这一分歧在技术流和浪漫主义方案间的分歧而他们堪称今天美国建筑业的领袖一个很年轻，一个更加成熟这是一家叫SHop的公司的作品你现在看到的是他们设计的公园里的一个特大号的暗箱的等角图大家都知道暗箱是什么吧？就是一个巨大的相机镜头一样的东西可以照出外面的世界就像个小电影机一样，只是没有任何移动部件—它把图象投在一张纸上，你绕着它走过时就能看到外面的景象
en:It&#39;s in our nature to go ricochetingback and forth between this technocratic solutionand a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.So we&#39;re going to go straight into this.Can I have the lights off for a moment?I&#39;m going to talk about two architects very, very brieflythat represent the current split, architecturally,between these two traditions of a technocraticor technological solution and a romantic solution.And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.One very young, one a little more mature.This is the work of a firm called SHoP,and what you&#39;re seeing here, is their isometric drawingsof what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?Yeah, it&#39;s one of those giant camera lensesthat takes a picture of the outside world —it&#39;s sort of a little movie, without any moving parts —and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.

zh-cn:这只是个粗略的概括，你看得见的它看上去象普通的房子吗？当然不象它没有直角，不是由上到下方方正正的而一般房子是那种形状电脑科技的革命，一种技术流的革命已经允许我们抛弃普通的传统的建筑造型，转而采用像这样的非直角的设计最有趣的还不是它的形状而是它的建造方法，它是怎么被造出来的这是一种崭新的建造方法一种叫“集中个性化”的东西。我可没自相矛盾在传统意义上，建造的昂贵费用是出于部件的个性化，你无法重复制造这就是为什么我们都情愿去住开发商的房子而他们都通过把同样的东西造个500份来节省成本因为这样便宜得多
en:This is just the outline of it, and you can see,does it look like a regular building? No.It&#39;s actually non-orthogonal: it&#39;s not up and down,square, rectangular, anything like that,that you&#39;d see in a normal shape of a building.The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.What&#39;s interesting about it is not the shape.What&#39;s interesting about it is how it&#39;s made. How it&#39;s made.A brand-new way to put buildings together,something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,is making individual parts custom, that you can&#39;t do over and over again.That&#39;s why we all live in developer houses.They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.That&#39;s because it&#39;s cheaper.

zh-cn:“集中个性化”就是说建筑师把一个程序放进电脑指令是：“给我制造这些部件。”电脑然后发指令给一个机器就是那种计算机化的辅助设计和制造的机器（cad-cam是computer aided design and manufacturing的缩写 —译者注）可以在一瞬间作出数不清的动作因为电脑就是个机器它才不管呢。它只负责生产部件它看不见什么额外成本，不懂什么叫加班连个工人都不是，只是个电子化的车床所以所有的部件都能同时被裁剪同时，我们用不着找人画图纸就是你一辈子与之打交道的大叠大叠的工程图建筑师要做的只是发出一套组装指令就象你童年时所遇到的小玩具模型上的说明，比如“把A固定在B上，C固定在D上”这样建筑工人拿到的是每一个单独的部件都在别的地方被个性化设计生产出来，然后用卡车运来运到工地，工人这边。还有一套说明手册就是简简单单的“把A固定在B”，工人们就能组装了这里有一个示意图这个是完成品
en:Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,a program that says, manufacture these parts.The computer then talks to a machine —a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine —that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment&#39;s notice,because the computer is just a machine.It doesn&#39;t care. It&#39;s manufacturing the parts.It doesn&#39;t see any excess cost. It doesn&#39;t spend any extra time.It&#39;s not a laborer — it&#39;s simply an electronic lathe,so the parts can all be cut at the same time.Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,which are those huge sets of blueprints that you&#39;ve seen your whole life,what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,like you used to get when you were a child,when you bought little models that said, &quot;Bolt A to B, and C to D.&quot;And so what the builder will get is every single individual partthat has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truckto the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.Just simple &quot;Bolt A to B&quot; and they will be able to put them together.Here&#39;s the little drawing that tells them how that works —and that&#39;s what will happen in the end.

en:You&#39;re underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,these same architects were asked to produce somethingfor the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,as part of their young architects summer series.And they said, well, it&#39;s summer, what do you do?In the summer, you go to the beach.And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.So let&#39;s make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,and that computer program shaped a sand duneand then took that sand dune shape and turned it into —at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications —a set of instructions for pieces of wood.And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.These are the pieces, and here&#39;s a little of that blown up.

en:What you can see is there&#39;s about six different colors,and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,and there it is fully built.There are only 16 different pieces of wood,only 16 different assembly parts here.Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.It&#39;s a great place for parties — it was, it was only up for six weeks.It&#39;s got little dressing rooms and cabanas,where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.

en:Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,that very important pedestrian connectionbetween the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,building it, including all of the parts, manufactured.And they were able to do it. That was their design,using that same computer modeling systemand only five or six really different kinds of parts,a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding materialand a very simple framing systemthat was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.They were able to create that.They were able to create something wonderful.They&#39;re now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,using the same technology.Here we&#39;re going to walk across the bridge at night.It&#39;s self-lit, you don&#39;t need any overhead lighting,so the neighbors don&#39;t complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.Here it is going across.

en:Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,whose work you can see out here today.The current king of the romantics, who approaches his workin a very different fashion.It&#39;s not to create a technological solution, it&#39;s to seduce youinto something that you can do, into something that will please you,something that will lift your spirits,something that will make you feel as if are in another world —such as his Nobu restaurant in New York,which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York Cityto the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.&quot;When it&#39;s all said and done, it&#39;s got to look like seaweed,&quot; said the owner.Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
