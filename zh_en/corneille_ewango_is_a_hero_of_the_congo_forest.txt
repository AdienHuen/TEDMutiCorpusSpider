zh-cn:我不会说英文我刚在一年前开始学说英语，学习英文我从小说法语长大，所以我的英语是法式英语我出生在刚果西部一个离这不远的地方后来去念了基桑加尼大学毕业后我就来到了这，伊图里森林但是我一直在从事的 -在我大约14岁的时候，我是在叔叔家长大我的父亲是一个士兵我的叔叔是一个渔夫同时也是一个偷猎者我在14到17岁间一直做的是帮他们收集象牙和肉还有任何他们在森林里所猎杀，偷盗，捕捉的猎物把这些所得带到大城里的集市上
en:I don&#39;t speak English.I start speaking English, learning English, about a year ago.I speak French and I grew up with French, so my English is Franglais.I&#39;m born in the Western Congo, in an area around here,and then went to university in Kisangani.And after I finished, I went to this area, the Ituri Forest.But what I&#39;ve been doing —when I was about 14, I grew in my uncle&#39;s house.And my father was a soldier,and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher.What I&#39;ve been doing from 14 to 17 was,I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk, meatand whatever they were killing, poaching, hunting in the forest,bring it in the main city to get access to the market.

zh-cn:但是最后，我自己也参与到了他们的行动中在约17到20岁时，我自己成为了一名偷猎者我从事的原因是我相信我的学业会得到继续我很想去上大学，但是我父亲很穷，叔叔更不用说了所以我就那么做了3到4年的时间里，我去了大学我申请了生物医学3次，想成为一名医生我没有成功我拿到了录取通知书，生物系收了我而我说，没门儿，我不会学它的我的父亲穷，我生活的地方没有好的医疗服务我想成为一名医生去给他们服务3次，也就是说3年，我开始慢慢长大了我说，噢，不，我要继续下去所以我学了热带生态学和栽培植物学当我毕业的时候，我去了伊图里森林实习就是在那我开始对现在所从事的工作充满激情一直延续到现在出现在你们面前还在做植物学和野生动物保护工作
en:But finally, I got myself involved.Around 17 to 20 years, I became, myself, a poacher.And I wanted to do it, because — I believed — to continue my studies.I wanted to go to university, but my father was poor, my uncle even.So, I did it.And for three to four years, I went to university.For three times, I applied to biomedical science, to be a doctor.I didn&#39;t succeed.I was having my inscriptions, my admission to biology.And I said, &quot;No way, I&#39;m not doing it.My family&#39;s poor, my area don&#39;t have better health care.I want to be a doctor to serve them.&quot;Three times, that means three years, and I start getting old.I say, &quot;Oh, no, I continue.&quot;So, I did tropical ecology and plant botany.When I finished, I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship.It&#39;s where I really getting passion with what I&#39;m doingright up to now — I&#39;m standing in front of you —doing botany and wildlife conservation.

zh-cn:那时伊图里森林建成了一个森林保护区有一些动物及植物还建了一个训练中心有一些刚果的科研人员还有一些美国的科研人员所以 Okapi 动物保护区防护数量 -我认为那时数量最多的象群我们现在正在一个刚果受保护的地区这里也有黑猩猩它被命名为 Okapi 动物保护区是源于这种美丽的物种那是一个林地长颈鹿我想大家对它都很了解这是草原长颈鹿但在进化过程中演变成林地长颈鹿它们只生活在刚果里面还有一些灵长类动物有13种 - 是我们在非洲能找到密度最大的地方还有就是伊图里森林本身据我所知有将近1300种植物
en:That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reservewith some animals and also plants.And the training center there was builtaround the scientific Congolese staffand some American scientists also.So, the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number —I think that is the largest number of elephantswe have right now in protected areas in Congo.It has also chimpanzees.And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reservebecause of this beautiful creature.That is a forest giraffe.I think you guys know it quite well.Here we have savanna giraffes,but through evolution we have this forest giraffethat lives only in Congo.It has also some beautiful primates.Thirteen species — highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa.And it has the Ituri Forest itself —about 1,300 species of plants, so far known.

zh-cn:我是在1995年加入野生动物保护协会的但是在1991年，当我还是学生的时候就开始为他们工作了我那时被任命为我大学的助教因为我获得了学位但是我不喜欢那种低质的教学方式我想到训练中心和研究中心去在Mobutu Sese Seko是独裁统治结束时大家都知道，生活变得非常非常困难而我们的工作完全无法完成
en:I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society, working there, in 1995,but I started working with them as a student in 1991.I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my universitybecause I accomplished with honor.But I didn&#39;t like the way — the instruction I got was very poor.And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center.With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko,that most of you know, life became very, very difficult.And the work we have been doingwas completely difficult to do and to achieve it.

zh-cn:当 Kabila 开始他的解放刚果运动的时候Mobutu 的士兵开始转移和撤退所以他们开始从东往西撤而 Okapi 动物保护区正好在那那有一条通往 Goma 的路，在这附近就是这样过来的所以他们可能会从 Okapi 动物保护区通过刚果有5个世界上最丰富的保护区而 Okapi 动物保护区就是其中之一那些士兵撤到了 Okapi 动物保护区里他们一路上掠劫所有的东西折磨，战争 - 噢，我的上帝，你们不会相信每一人都在找寻出路，我们不得而知特别是对我们这些第一次经历的年轻人我们感受到了枪林弹雨的滋味甚至所有经历1963年那场叛乱的人在我们独立后，他们都没有办法相信当年所发生的事他们屠杀百姓，胡作非为因为他们手中有权利是谁做了那些？小孩子们，童子军你不能得知他们的年龄，因为他们手里有枪
en:When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo,so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated.So they started fleeing from the east to the west.And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there,so there was a road from Goma, somewhere here,and coming like this.So they might go through, pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve.Congo has five of the world&#39;s richest sites of protected area,and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them.So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve.On their way, they looted everything.Torture, wars — oh, my God, you can&#39;t believe.Every person was looking his way — where to go, we don&#39;t know.And it was for us, the young, the first time reallywe hear the language of war, of guns.And even people who faced the rebellion of 1963,after our independence, they didn&#39;t believe what was happening.They were killing people. They were doing whatever they wantbecause they have power.Who have been doing that?Young children. Child soldiers.You can&#39;t ask him how old he is because he has guns.

zh-cn:但我是从西部来的，工作在东部在那时候我甚至不会说斯瓦希里语他们来后掠夺了所有东西你不能说林格拉语，因为那是 Mobutu 所用的语言所有说林格拉语的都是士兵而我跟他来自同一个地方我所有的朋友都说，我们最好还是离开，因为我们已经成为目标但是我是不会去东部的，因为去了那我不会说斯瓦希里语我要留下。如果我走了会被杀掉我不能再回到我的地盘 - 那有1000公里远
en:But I was from the west, working in the east.I even [at] that time was not speaking Swahili.And when they came, they looted everything.You can&#39;t speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu,and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier.And I was from the same area to him.All my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target.But I&#39;m not going to the east, because I don&#39;t know Swahili.I stay. If I go, I will be killed.I can&#39;t go back to my area — it&#39;s more than 1,000 kilometers [away].

zh-cn:我再他们掠夺了所有东西后留下我们一直在开展植物学方面的研究我们有一个小干燥标本集，上边有4500种植物我们采摘，干燥，然后把它们包好我们把它们附在一个夹子上目的 - 这样我们就能够用它们于农业于医药，于天气 - 还有于科学于花卉和森林的变化方面的研究那是一些人在周围转悠，那甚至还有皮革米人这是一个聪明勤劳的人，皮革米我跟他一起共事大概有10年了跟士兵一起，它们到森林里面从事盗猎大象的活动因为他是皮革米人，他知道怎样在森林里追踪大象他曾被豹袭击，那些人就把他抛弃在森林里他们来跟我说是我救了他们而我所做的就是给他们一些抗生素而已那时我们用来治疗肺结核的幸运的是，我救了他的命
en:I stayed after they looted everything.We have been doing research on botany,and we have a small herbarium of 4,500 sheets of plants.We cut, we dry and we packed them,we mounted them on a folder.Purpose: so that we start them for agriculture,for medicine, for whatever, and for science,for the study of the flora and the change of the forest.That is people moving around, that&#39;s even Pygmies.And this is a bright guy, hard-working person, and Pygmy.I&#39;ve been working with him about 10 years.And with soldiers, they went to the forest for poaching elephants.Because he&#39;s Pygmy, he knows how to track elephants in the forest.He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest.They came to told me, I have to save him.And what I did, I gave him just antibioticsthat we care for tuberculosis.And fortunately, I saved his life.

zh-cn:那就是战争的模样所有的人都在不断的采伐资源捕杀动物，砍伐树木等等而重要的是我想再座的每一位都有一个手机那个玩意已经让很多人丧命五百万的刚果人因为这个而丧生铜镍合金，他们叫做 Coltan他们就是用这个来制造手机这那个地区可以找到这种矿，开采，遍布刚果这是引起战争的一个重要原因
en:And that was the language of the war.Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral,killing animals, the logging timbers and so on.And what of important things —I think all of you here have a cell phone.That mineral has killed a lot:five millions of Congolese have gone because of thisColombo-Tantalite — they call it Coltan —that they use it to make cell phonesand it has been in that area, all over in Congo. Extraction,and good, big business of the war.

zh-cn:在第一次战争过后我们失去了所有东西，我所做的是我挽救了一些东西，包括我自己，我的生命和同事的生命我埋藏了一些我们的新的汽车引擎，以保护它们一些设备被他们带走放在在天棚顶上，以保存它他不是在采摘植物，而是将要保护我们的设备在天棚上至于那些剩下的原料因为他们想销毁它，烧掉它他们不理解它，他们没有上过学我把它们包起来那是我，将要，赶往乌干达设法保存那4000个标本跟人们一起用摩托和单车运在我们成功以后我把那4000个标本存放在 Makerere 大学的标本集里在战争过后，我可以将它们带回来那样我们就能够继续我们的研究
en:And what I did for the first war, after we have lost everything,I have to save something, even myself, my life and life of the staff.I buried some of our new vehicle engines, I buried it to save it.And some of equipment went with them,on the top of the canopy, to save it.He&#39;s not collecting plants, he&#39;s going to save our equipmenton the canopy.And with the material that&#39;s left —because they wanted to destroy it, to burn it,they didn&#39;t understand it, they didn&#39;t go to school —I packed it.And that is me, going to, hurrying to Uganda,to try to save that 4,000 material,with people carrying them on the bikes, bicycles.And after that, we succeeded.I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.And after the war, I have been able to bring it back home,so that we continue our studies.

en:The second war came while we didn&#39;t expect it.With friends, we had been sitting and watching match football,and having some good music with WorldSpace radio,when it started, I think.So, it was so bad.We heard that now from the east again the war started,and it&#39;s going fast.This time I think Kabila will go in place of, as he did with Mobutu.And the reserve was a target to the rebels.Three different movements and two militia acting in the same areaand competing for natural resources.And there was no way to work.They destroy everything.Poaching — oh, no way.And that&#39;s the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them.What&#39;s the regulation of the reserveand what is the regulation of the parks?And they can&#39;t do what they are doing.So we went to meet them.That is Coltan extraction, gold mining.

zh-cn:所以我开始跟他们谈说服他们我们是在一个受保护的地区这是规定砍伐，开采和盗猎都是被特别禁止的但是他们说：“你们”你认为那些士兵的牺牲都不重要吗而你们所保护的动物是最重要的我们不这么认为我们必须这么做是因为这让我们的运动进步我说：“不行，你们不能在这这么做”我们开始和他们对话，我在谈判试着保护我们的设备，试着保护我们的人员这个村庄大概有1500人我们在继续
en:So, we started talking with them,convincing them that we are in a protected area.There are regulationsthat it&#39;s prohibited to do logging, mining and poaching, specifically.But they said, &quot;You guys,you think that soldiers who are dying are not important,and your animals you are protecting are most important.We don&#39;t think so.We have to do it, because to let our movement advance.&quot;I say, &quot;No way, you are not going to do it here.&quot;We started talking with them and I was negotiating.Tried to protect our equipment, tried to protect our staffand the villages of about 1,500 people.And we continued.

en:During the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo.We have a zoo of 14 Okapis, and one of them was pregnant.And during the war, after a week of heavy war, fighting in the area,we succeeded: we had the first Okapi.This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.This is not local population, this is rebels.They are now happy sending the newsthat they have protected the Okapi with the war,because we sent the news that they are killingand poaching everywhere.After a week, we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi,they killed an elephant, just 50 meters to the areawhere the zoo, where Okapi was born.And I was mad.I oppose it — that they are now going to dissect it,until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander.And I succeeded.The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks.

en:What we are doing after that — that was the situation of the war —we have to rebuild.I had some money. I was paid 150 dollars.I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium,because we didn&#39;t have good infrastructure to start plants.Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants.I started this with 70 dollars,and start fundraising money to where I&#39;ve been going.I had opportunity to go all over,where herbarium for my African material is.And they supported me a bit, and I built this.Now, it&#39;s doing work to train young Congolese.

en:And also, what one of the speciality we are doing,my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity,and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon.This is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot,where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters,and we are tracking them.We have now data of about 15 years,to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions.And that is — I think it&#39;s difficult for me.This is a very embarrassing talk, I know.I don&#39;t know where to start, where to finish it.

en:Corneille Ewango: That&#39;s really embarrassing questions.I think that now I feel nervous.And I think, helping us, people are acting sometimes by ignorance.I did it myself.If I know when I was young,that [by] killing an elephant, I&#39;m destroying biodiversity,I would not have done it.Many, many of you have seen the talents of Africans,but there are few who are going to school.Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics,HIV, malaria, poverty, not going to school.What you can assist us, it&#39;s by building capacities.How many have got opportunity like meto go to U.S., do a master&#39;s?And go — now, I&#39;m in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D.But many of them are just here, because they don&#39;t have money.And they can&#39;t go even to university.They can&#39;t even attain the bachelor&#39;s degree.Building capacities for the young generationis going to make a better generationand a better future tomorrow for Africa.
