zh-cn:我要讲的是如何从一个全新的角度去看世界我要说的是微观世界在从事这项工作多年以后，我发现现实的背后藏着一个魔幻的世界我们可以透过显微镜直接观察它今天我要跟你们分享其中一部分
en:So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the worldfrom a totally unique point of view,and this world I&#39;m going to talk about is the micro world.I&#39;ve found, after doing this for many, many years,that there&#39;s a magical world behind reality.And that can be seen directly through a microscope,and I&#39;m going to show you some of this today.

zh-cn:我们先从那些还不算太小的肉眼就能观察到的东西开始吧这是一只蜜蜂 你看它大概是这样的大小 大约一厘米但是如果真的要看清楚细节 真正地欣赏它 你就更近距离地观察这是在显微镜下蜜蜂的眼部忽然间你能看到蜜蜂的眼睛其实是由上千只小眼所构成 叫做复眼眼睛当中其实还有具传感作用的短毛这样如果马上要碰到什么东西的时候能立刻察觉因为蜜蜂是看不到立体影像的
en:So let&#39;s start off looking at something rather not-so-small,something that we can see with our naked eye,and that&#39;s a bee. So when you look at this bee,it&#39;s about this size here, it&#39;s about a centimeter.But to really see the details of the bee, and reallyappreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer.So that&#39;s just the eye of the bee with a microscope,and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee hasthousands of individual eyes called ommatidia,and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyesso they know when they&#39;re right up close to something,because they can&#39;t see in stereo.

zh-cn:当我们观察得更细微时，这是人类的头发头发大概是肉眼能看到的最小的东西了大约是十分之一毫米
en:As we go smaller, here is a human hair.A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.It&#39;s about a tenth of a millimeter.

zh-cn:让我们再缩小一点再小十倍的话，是细胞的大小十个人体细胞刚好能排满一根头发直径的长度
en:And as we go smaller again,about ten times smaller than that, is a cell.So you could fit 10 human cellsacross the diameter of a human hair.

zh-cn:所以说我们观察细胞的时候 这是我参与生物学和科学研究的方式我用显微镜来观察活细胞当我第一次从显微镜下看到活细胞时，我完全被它们的样子迷住了如果你看到免疫系统的细胞它们其实活跃于各处这个细胞在寻找异物细菌等能找到的东西在此过程中，一旦有了目标并确认是异物就会把它吞噬掉你看，就在那里， 它找到了一个小细菌于是就把它包围起来吃掉了如果从动物身上取部分心脏细胞再放到培养皿里，它们就会在那里不住地跳动因为这是职责所在 每个生命体内的细胞都有其使命这些细胞 它们的任务是把血液运送到身体各处这些是神经细胞 此刻当我们边看边学的时候我们的脑细胞和神经细胞其实也在做一样的事情它们不是静止的 它们在活动建立新的联系 这是学习的过程
en:So when we would look at cells, this is how I really gotinvolved in biology and science is by lookingat living cells in the microscope.When I first saw living cells in a microscope, I wasabsolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like.So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system,they&#39;re actually moving all over the place.This cell is looking for foreign objects,bacteria, things that it can find.And it&#39;s looking around, and when it finds something,and recognizes it being foreign,it will actually engulf it and eat it.So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium,and it engulfs it and eats it.If you take some heart cells from an animal,and put it in a dish, they&#39;ll just sit there and beat.That&#39;s their job. Every cell has a mission in life,and these cells, the mission isto move blood around our body.These next cells are nerve cells, and right now,as we see and understand what we&#39;re looking at,our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing thisright now. They&#39;re not just static. They&#39;re moving aroundmaking new connections, and that&#39;s what happens when we learn.

zh-cn:当我们把测量范围进一步缩小就是一微米 接下来到纳米和埃（一亿分之一厘米）埃的大小恰好是一个氢原子的直径的长度这就是小的程度如今的显微镜能让人们看到独立的原子 这些是它们的照片 每一个凸起都是一个单独的原子这是一圈钴原子
en:As you go farther down this scale here,that&#39;s a micron, or a micrometer, and we goall the way down to here to a nanometerand an angstrom. Now, an angstrom is the sizeof the diameter of a hydrogen atom.That&#39;s how small that is.And microscopes that we have today can actually seeindividual atoms. So these are some picturesof individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom.This is a ring of cobalt atoms.

zh-cn:这一切，这个纳米世界, 以上被称为纳米世界在整个看得见的微观世界里面还藏着这样一个纳米世界这是分子和原子的世界
en:So this whole world, the nano world, this area in hereis called the nano world, and the nano world,the whole micro world that we see,there&#39;s a nano world that is wrapped up within that, andthe whole — and that is the world of molecules and atoms.

zh-cn:假设你是住在花朵里的一只小昆虫那朵花看起来是什么样子的呢，如果它有这么大的话看上去和感觉上跟人类观察到的角度肯定是不一样的 所以如果你从这里看这朵花而你又是一只虫子 就在花里头这个就是它看上去的样子花瓣是这样的 而小蚂蚁就在这些东西上面爬行 如果再靠近一点的话在柱头和雄蕊这里这是花柱 注意看上面有这些细小 像喈哩状的东西我们称为花距 这是蜜距换而言之 对小蚂蚁而言 就像置身于威力旺卡(Willy Wonka)的奇妙世界当中一样有如身处迪士尼乐园 跟我们看到的不一样这是颗粒花粉的样子在那里 还有那里 这个呢是你看到的那些呈黄点状的花粉透过显微镜 它其实是由上千个细小的花粉粒所组成举例来说 当你看到蜜蜂环绕着这些小株植物飞行 并采集花粉时它们搜集花粉粒把它们藏在腿上 再带回巢中是建筑蜂巢的原料就是蜂蜡 同时它们也搜集花蜜也就是酿造我们吃的蜂蜜的材料
en:So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower,what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?It wouldn&#39;t look or feel like anything that we seewhen we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here,and you&#39;re a little bug, if you&#39;re on that surfaceof that flower, that&#39;s what the terrain would look like.The petal of that flower looks like that, so the antis kind of crawling over these objects, and if you looka little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here,this is the style of that flower, and you noticethat it&#39;s got these little — these are like little jelly-like thingsthat are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.So this little ant that&#39;s crawling here, it&#39;s likeit&#39;s in a little Willy Wonka land.It&#39;s like a little Disneyland for them. It&#39;s not like what we see.These are little bits of individual grain of pollenthere and there, and here is a —what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen,when you look in a microscope, it&#39;s actually madeof thousands of little grains of pollen.So this, for example, when you see bees flying aroundthese little plants, and they&#39;re collecting pollen,those pollen grains that they&#39;re collecting, they packinto their legs and they take it back to the hive,and that&#39;s what makes the beehive,the wax in the beehive. And they&#39;re also collecting nectar,and that&#39;s what makes the honey that we eat.

zh-cn:这是一幅特写，就是平常的凤眼蓝的图片，假如你有很好的视力肉眼就能看得同样清楚了这是雄蕊和雌蕊 再来看显微镜下它们的样子 这是雄蕊这是上千个花粉微粒这是雌蕊 这些小东西称为毛状物 是花朵用来散发香味用的植物之间的沟通用的就是它们的香气
en:Here&#39;s a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular pictureof a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision,with your naked eye, you&#39;d see it about that well.There&#39;s the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamenand the pistil look like in a microscope. That&#39;s the stamen.So that&#39;s thousands of little grains of pollen there,and there&#39;s the pistil there, and these are the little thingscalled trichomes. And that&#39;s what makes the flower givea fragrance, and plants actually communicatewith one another through their fragrances.

zh-cn:我想讲一些真的很常见的事物平常的沙粒大约十年前起我开始对沙产生了兴趣当我初次见到来自毛伊岛(Maui)的沙的时候这就是毛伊岛的沙一粒沙差不多是十分一毫米每一粒都大概是这个大小但当你靠近细看时，看看观察的结果是很迷人的 你看到的是微小的贝壳有像珊瑚一样的东西还有其他贝类的碎片 有橄榄石火山碎片 那里有一点点是火山碎片 还有管栖蠕虫沙里面藏着许多引人入胜的东西之所以有这样的结果，是因为这个岛上大部分的沙都是由生物材料构成的因为礁石是许多极小生物生长的地方当它们死去后他们的壳和牙齿还有骨头会分解形成沙粒像是珊瑚等比方说 这就是一幅毛伊岛上沙的图片这是来自于拉海纳(Lhaina)我们沿着沙滩走的时候其实也正在浏览历经百万年的生物学和地理学历史我们或者没有意识到这点，但它确实是生态系统的完整纪录请看 这是一个海绵骨针两个珊瑚碎片一根海胆刺 真的是很吸引人的
en:I want to talk about something really ordinary,just ordinary sand.I became interested in sand about 10 years ago,when I first saw sand from Maui,and in fact, this is a little bit of sand from Maui.So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.But when you look closer at this, look at what&#39;s there.It&#39;s really quite amazing. You have microshells there.You have things like coral.You have fragments of other shells. You have olivine.You have bits of a volcano. There&#39;s a little bitof a volcano there. You have tube worms.An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand.And the reason that is, is because in a place like this island,a lot of the sand is made of biological materialbecause the reefs provide a place where all thesemicroscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow,and when they die, their shells and their teethand their bones break up and they make grains of sand,things like coral and so forth.So here&#39;s, for example, a picture of sand from Maui.This is from Lahaina,and when we&#39;re walking along a beach, we&#39;re actuallywalking along millions of years of biological and geological history.We don&#39;t realize it, but it&#39;s actually a recordof that entire ecology.So here we see, for example, a sponge spicule,two bits of coral here,that&#39;s a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff.

zh-cn:所以我第一次看的时候我想的是这简直是一个宝库啊实在让人难以置信 我到处寻找分析这些细小的片断 再为它们拍照世界上大部分的沙看起来是这个样子的这些是石英晶体和长石也就是说地球大陆上大多数的沙都是石英晶体和长石构成的 是花岗岩被侵蚀后的产物山脉形成后经历流水和冰霜雨雪等的洗礼最后就成了沙子有一些沙的色彩特别丰富这些是五大湖区附近的沙可以看到里面有粉色石榴石和绿帘石以及各种神奇的矿物质当观察来自不同地方的沙每一片海滩每一个地方的沙都是不一样的。这是大苏尔(Big Sur)海岸的沙 它们像小粒的珠宝在非洲某处 人们开采宝石的地方你去看江河汇入大海处的沙 在显微镜下就跟看着微小的宝石一般所以说每一粒沙都是独一无二的. 每处沙滩也各不相同这世上没有一模一样的两粒砂每一粒沙子都有自己的过去和未来通过沙粒我们看到一幅浓缩了时空的快照
en:So when I first looked at this, I was — I thought,gee, this is like a little treasure trove here.I couldn&#39;t believe it, and I&#39;d go around dissectingthe little bits out and making photographs of them.Here&#39;s what most of the sand in our world looks like.These are quartz crystals and feldspar,so most sand in the world on the mainlandis made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It&#39;s the erosion of granite rock.So mountains are built up, and they erode away by waterand rain and ice and so forth,and they become grains of sand.There&#39;s some sand that&#39;s really much more colorful.These are sand from near the Great Lakes,and you can see that it&#39;s filled with mineralslike pink garnet and green epidote, all kinds of amazing stuff,and if you look at different sands from different places,every single beach, every single place you look at sand,it&#39;s different. Here&#39;s from Big Sur, like they&#39;re little jewels.There are places in Africa where they do the miningof jewels, and you go to the sand where the rivers havethe sand go down to the ocean, and it&#39;s like literally lookingat tiny jewels through the microscope.So every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different.Every single grain is different. There are no two grainsof sand alike in the world.Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere.They&#39;re like a snapshot in time.

zh-cn:不仅在地球上有沙宇宙当中它们也是无处不在的 事实上 外太空充斥着沙 它们汇聚一体形成我们的行星和月球你看这些微小的陨石是军方提供的来自南极饮用水的取水井实在是非常迷人 正是这些微小的元素造就了我们所生活的行星系和月球
en:Now sand is not only on Earth, but sand isubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact, outer spaceis filled with sand, and that sand comes togetherto make our planets and the Moon.And you can see those in micrometeorites.This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me,and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole.And they&#39;re quite amazing-looking, and these are thetiny constituents that make up the world that we live in —the planets and the Moon.

zh-cn:美国宇航局局(NASA)希望我能给月球上的沙拍点照片他们把四十年前阿波罗计划登月时在不同着陆点所搜集到的沙发给了我然后我就开始用三维显微镜给它们拍照这是第一张 惊人的美我觉得它看上去就像月球 所以很妙显微镜的工作原理是 通常情况下用显微镜 我们每次能观察到的并不多所以就必须不断的重新对焦连续拍摄 然后运用电脑程序汇总所有的照片整合为一张后才能看到真实的样子而我则要在三维空间里做上述的事 请看这是左眼的视角 这是右眼的视角就像先左边看 再右边看
en:So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand,so they sent me sand from all the different landingsof the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago.And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes.This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing.I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon, which is sort of interesting.Now, the way my microscopes work is, normallyin a microscope you can see very little at one time,so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope,keep taking pictures, and then I have a computer programthat puts all those pictures togetherinto one picture so you can see actually what it looks like,and I do that in 3D. So there, you can see,is a left-eye view. There&#39;s a right-eye view.So sort of left-eye view, right-eye view.

zh-cn:这里很有趣的是 它看起来跟我所看过的所有地球上的沙都不一样相信我 地球上的沙我看得可不少你看中间的空洞 它是由于小陨石撞击月球而形成的因为月球没有大气层 所以会不断受到陨尘的袭击 月球表面如今呈粉末状 就是由于40亿年来不断被陨尘撞击的结果当陨尘以每小时20到六万英里的速度袭来时 一旦击中目标便会气化你可以从这里看到 那就是类似气化后的状况 它能把细小的沙粒凝聚在一起这是一粒小沙子也被称作环状凝聚物许多月球表面的沙粒都是这个样子的而地球上找不到月球上大部分的沙尤其是，你可以看到月球有背光面也有向光面背光面是熔岩流 是玄武岩的熔岩流这是它们的沙的样子和哈里阿卡拉火山（Haleakala）的沙很像其他的沙子 当陨石接近时它们会气化而形成这些喷泉这些微小的喷泉喷涌而上我本来想说冲到空中，但是这里并没有空气那就只能说涌向上方吧 这些微粒瞬间成型并固化为玻璃状的颗粒当它们坠回月球表面的时候就成了色彩斑斓的玻璃小球它们都是能用显微镜捕捉得到的只要有合适的工具
en:Now something&#39;s interesting here. This looks very differentthan any sand on Earth that I&#39;ve ever seen, and I&#39;veseen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me. (Laughter)Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was causedby a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.Now, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeoritescome in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moonis covered with powder now, because for four billion yearsit&#39;s been bombarded by micrometeorites,and when micrometeorites come in at about20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact.And you can see here that that is —that&#39;s sort of vaporized, and that material is holding thislittle clump of little sand grains together.This is a very small grain of sand, this whole thing.And that&#39;s called a ring agglutinate.And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that,and you&#39;d never find that on Earth.Most of the sand on the Moon,especially — and you know when you look at the Moon,there&#39;s the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areasare lava flows. They&#39;re basaltic lava flows,and that&#39;s what this sand looks like, very similarto the sand that you would see in Haleakala.Other sands, when these micrometeorites come in,they vaporize and they make these fountains,these microscopic fountains that go up into the —I was going to say &quot;up into the air,&quot; but there is no air —goes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beadsare formed instantly, and they harden, and by the timethey fall down back to the surface of the Moon,they have these beautiful colored glass spherules.And these are actually microscopic;you need a microscope to see these.

zh-cn:这是一颗来自月球的沙粒你能看到完整的剔透的结构仍得以完整的呈现这粒沙大概有三十五亿到四十亿年的历史了它没有像地球上的沙那样受到水分，碰撞空气等的侵蚀 只有看到的极小的侵蚀来自太阳 像是太阳雨和太阳辐射
en:Now here&#39;s a grain of sand that is from the Moon,and you can see that the entirecrystal structure is still there.This grain of sand is probably aboutthree and a half or four billion years old,and it&#39;s never eroded away like the way we have sandon Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling,air, and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosiondown here by the Sun, has these solar storms,and that&#39;s erosion by solar radiation.

zh-cn:所以说 今天我想告诉大家的是平凡如一粒沙只要观察入微，也有它独特的魅力只要你能找到不同的视角和新的观察角度我想英国诗人威廉·布莱克(William Blake)说的最好了一沙一世界一花一片天掌中握无限永恒刹那间谢谢（掌声）
en:So what I&#39;ve been trying to tell you today isthings even as ordinary as a grain of sandcan be truly extraordinary if you look closelyand if you look from a different and a new point of view.I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said,&quot;To see a world in a grain of sandand a heaven in a wild flower,hold infinity in the palm of your hand,and eternity in an hour.&quot;Thank you. (Applause)
