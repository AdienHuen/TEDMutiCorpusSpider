zh-cn:我是一个赝造者的女儿不是一般的赝造者当听到“赝造”这个词 你会想到“唯利是图”会想到“赝币” “赝画”我父亲不是这样的人曾经有30年他从事文件伪造工作从来不为自己 只为别人为了受迫害和压迫的人请允许我介绍他这是我父亲19岁的时候一切开始于二战期间年仅17岁的他被带进一个伪造文件的作坊很快他成为抵抗运动一方的文件伪造专家这不是个平庸的故事解放后他一直伪造文件直到70年代
en:I am the daughter of a forger,not just any forger ...When you hear the word &quot;forger,&quot; you often understand &quot;mercenary.&quot;You understand &quot;forged currency,&quot; &quot;forged pictures.&quot;My father is no such man.For 30 years of his life,he made false papers —never for himself, always for other people,and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.Let me introduce him.Here is my father at age 19.It all began for him during World War II,when at age 17 he found himself thrustinto a forged documents workshop.He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.And it&#39;s not a banal story —after the liberation he continuedto make false papers until the &#39;70s.

zh-cn:当我还是孩子的时候当然什么都不懂中间做鬼脸那个就是我我在巴黎郊区长大是三个孩子里最小的我以为他像其他爸爸一样“平凡”除了他（比妈妈）大30岁差不多可以做我祖父了他是一个摄影师 一个街头教育者他总是教育我们要遵纪守法当然他从没透露过他的过去关于他是赝造者的事
en:When I was a childI knew nothing about this, of course.This is me in the middle making faces.I grew up in the Paris suburbsand I was the youngest of three children.I had a &quot;normal&quot; dad like everybody else,apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.Anyway, he was a photographer and a street educator,and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.And, of course, he never talked about his past lifewhen he was a forger.

zh-cn:但是 下面我要讲一件事这件事差点让我起疑我上高中时 有一次考得非常差那不是我的常态发挥所以我决定藏起来不让父母知道为此我着手伪造他们的签名我开始研究我母亲的签名因为我父亲的绝对没法伪造于是我掏出几张纸开始练习 练习 练习直到我觉得有把握了就开始行动后来 在检查我书包的时候我母亲翻出我的作业 立刻看到了伪造的签名她史无前例地大声责备我我躲到房里 藏在毯子底下等着父亲下班回家很是提心吊胆我听见他进来但仍裹在毯子里 他进了屋坐在床角一声不吭 我就拉开毯子他看着我 开始大笑他笑得停不下来 手里还拿着我的作业他说 “莎拉 你还不够努力 没发现签得太小了吗？”确实是挺小的
en:There was, however, an incident I&#39;m going to tell you about,that perhaps could have led me suspect something.I was in high school and got a bad grade,a rare event for me,so I decided to hide it from my parents.In order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.I started working on my mother&#39;s signature,because my father&#39;s is absolutely impossible to forge.So, I got working. I took some sheets of paperand started practicing, practicing, practicing,until I reached what I thought was a steady hand,and went into action.Later, while checking my school bag,my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.She yelled at me like she never had before.I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets,and then I waited for my father to come back from workwith, one could say, much apprehension.I heard him come in.I remained under the blankets. He entered my room,sat on the corner of the bed,and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head,and when he saw me he started laughing.He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.Then he said, &quot;But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can&#39;t you see it&#39;s really too small?&quot;Indeed, it&#39;s rather small.

zh-cn:我出生于阿尔及利亚在那里我听见别人说我父亲是个&quot;moudjahid&quot;意思是“斗士”后来在法国 我喜欢偷听大人们讲话我听到各种各样的关于我父亲过去的故事特别是他“参与”二战及阿尔及利亚战争的事在我的认知里参与战争就是成为士兵但我父亲一直宣称他是非暴力的和平主义者很难想象他戴着头盔扛着枪确实 我完全猜错了
en:I was born in Algeria.There I would hear people say my father was a &quot;moudjahid&quot;and that means &quot;fighter.&quot;Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups&#39; conversations,and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father&#39;s previous life,especially that he had &quot;done&quot; World War II,that he had &quot;done&quot; the Algerian war.And in my head I would be thinking that &quot;doing&quot; a war meant being a soldier.But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent,I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.And indeed, I was very far from the mark.

zh-cn:有天 我父亲在做一份证件为了给我们申请法国国籍我正好看见一些文件引起了我的注意这些都是真的这些是我的 我成了阿根廷人但我看到的那份足够当局做立案证据的文件是一份来自军方代表特情处向我父亲致谢的文件我一看 “哇”出了声我父亲是特工？特有007的范儿我有很多问题想问 不过他没回答后来我想总有一天我得问出来后来我做了母亲 有了一个儿子终于我觉得是时候了 他必须如实告诉我们我当上母亲时他正庆祝他的77岁生日我突然非常害怕害怕他离开把他的沉默带走把他的秘密带走我让他知道 他的故事对于我们或许还有别人都是很重要的他决定告诉我他的故事我将其写成一本书一会儿我会为各位读些摘录
en:One day, while my father was working on a filefor us to obtain French nationality,I happened to see some documentsthat caught my attention.These are real!These are mine, I was born an Argentinean.But the document I happened to seethat would help us build a case for the authoritieswas a document from the armythat thanked my father for his workon behalf of the secret services.And then, suddenly, I went &quot;wow!&quot;My father, a secret agent?It was very James Bond.I wanted to ask him questions, which he didn&#39;t answer.And later, I told myself thatone day I would have to question him.And then I became a mother and had a son,and finally decided it was time — that he absolutely had to talk to us.I had become a motherand he was celebrating his 77th birthday,and suddenly I was very, very afraid.I feared he&#39;d goand take his silences with him,and take his secrets with him.I managed to convince him that it was important for us,but possibly also for other peoplethat he shared his story.He decided to tell it to meand I made a book,from which I&#39;m going to read you some excerpts later.

zh-cn:关于他的故事 他出生于阿根廷父母是俄裔全家人在30年代搬到法国他的父亲是俄裔犹太人 非常贫穷所以我父亲14岁就得开始干活而他的学历仅仅到小学水平只能到染洗店做工在那儿他发现了奇妙的东西他把那东西说得引人入胜那就是神奇的染色化学正值战时他母亲在他15岁时就被杀害了于是就在这时他开始全身心投入到化学中去这是他排解悲伤的唯一方式每天他有一堆问题问老板不断学习 积累越来越多的知识夜深无人的时候他将积累的经验用于实践他最感兴趣的是墨水脱色
en:So, his story. My father was born in Argentina.His parents were of Russian descent.The whole family came to settle in France in the &#39;30s.His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.So at the age of 14 my father had to work.And with his only diploma,his primary education certificate,he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.That&#39;s where he discovered something totally magical,and when he talks about it, it&#39;s fascinating —it&#39;s the magic of dyeing chemistry.During that time the war was happeningand his mother was killed when he was 15.This coincided with the time whenhe threw himself body and soul into chemistrybecause it was the only consolation for his sadness.All day he would ask many questions to his bossto learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge,and at night, when no one was looking,he&#39;d put his experience to practice.He was mostly interested in ink bleaching.

zh-cn:说这么多的意思是我父亲成为一个赝造者其实是无心之为他的家人都是犹太人 所以遭到追捕最终他们被捕带往德兰西集中营多亏有阿根廷证件 他们得以离开虽然他们出来了但仍然危险 证件上还盖着“犹太人”的章我祖父决定他们得弄到假证件我父亲一直被教导要做守法公民虽然他受到迫害但从没想过办假证件这回事但他去见了一个来自抵抗军的人
en:All this to tell youthat if my father became a forger, actually,it was almost by accident.His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy campand they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.Well, they were out,but they were always in danger. The big &quot;Jew&quot; stamp was still on their papers.It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.My father had been instilled with such respect for the lawthat although he was being persecuted,he&#39;d never thought of false papers.But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance.

zh-cn:那时文件是硬皮的手写的信息上面还要填写工作为了生存 他需要工作他让那个人写上“染匠”突然那个人很感兴趣地看着他你是染匠 那你知道怎么去掉墨迹吗？他当然知道突然那个人开始解释抵抗军面临一个大问题即使是顶级专家也无法去除一种“不可磨灭”的墨迹即“威迪文”蓝墨水我父亲立刻回答说他知道怎么去除这下 那个人当然对这个17岁的年轻人刮目相看他能立刻给出方法 所以那个人雇了他实际上 我父亲自己都不知道 他发明了如今在每个学生笔盒里都能找到的东西所谓的“涂改液”（鼓掌）
en:In those times documents had hard covers,they were filled in by hand,and they stated your job.In order to survive, he neededto be working. He asked the manto write &quot;dyer.&quot;Suddenly the man looked very, very interested.As a &quot;dyer,&quot; do you know how to bleach ink marks?Of course he knew.And suddenly the man started explaining thatactually the whole Resistance had a huge problem:even the top expertscould not manage to bleach an ink, called &quot;indelible,&quot;the &quot;Waterman&quot; blue ink.And my father immediately replied that he knew exactlyhow to bleach it.Now, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17who could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented somethingwe can find in every schoolchild&#39;s pencil case:the so-called &quot;correction pen.&quot;(Applause)

zh-cn:但那只是开始我的父亲他刚到实验室虽然他是最年轻的却立刻意识到伪造文件存在一个问题所有工程都停在了篡改这一步篡改已有的文件已经不易而且需求一直在增长他告诉自己一切要从零开始他安置印刷机 开始修照片做橡胶印章发明各种各样的东西他用一个自行车车轮和其他材料造出离心分离机总之 他必须这么做因为这一切生死攸关他做了一个简单计算他一个小时能做30份文件如果他睡上一个小时 就会有30个人死去
en:But it was only the beginning.That&#39;s my father.As soon as he got to the lab,even though he was the youngest,he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.All the movements stopped at falsifying.But demand was ever-growingand it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.He started a press. He started photoengraving.He started making rubber stamps.He started inventing all kind of things —with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.Anyway, he had to do all thisbecause he was completely obsessed with output.He had made a simple calculation:In one hour he could make 30 forged documents.If he slept one hour, 30 people would die.

zh-cn:从17岁起这种对他人生命的责任感以及没能带朋友一起逃出集中营而带来的愧疚感便跟随了他一生这也许是他30年间不断赝造文件的根源不惜任何代价我想谈谈那些代价因为那是很大的牺牲首先是经济上的牺牲他总是拒绝接受报酬对他而言 接受报酬就意味着他的行为有功利性如果他收了钱他就失去了选择做或者不做的权利不管是否正义都要照做他白天摄影晚上造假 持续了30年一生都穷困不堪
en:This sense ofresponsibility for other people&#39;s lives when he was just 17 —and also his guilt for being a survivor,since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not —stayed with him all his life.And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years,he continued to make false papersat the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.I&#39;d like to talk about those sacrifices,because there were many.There were obviously financial sacrificesbecause he always refused to be paid.To him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.If he had accepted payment,he wouldn&#39;t be able to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.So he was a photographer by day,and a forger by night for 30 years.He was broke all of the time.

zh-cn:同时他也付出了情感上的代价一个人怎么能带着这么多秘密与妻子生活在一起？他要怎么解释每晚在实验室做什么？当然 还有另一个牺牲这牵扯到他的家庭 我过了很久才知道有天父亲把我介绍给我姐姐他说我还有个哥哥我头次见他们的时候大概三四岁而他们比我长30多岁现在都已经60多了
en:Then there were the emotional sacrifices:How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?Of course, there was another kind of sacrificeinvolving his family that I understood much later.One day my father introduced me to my sister.He also explained to me that I had a brother, too,and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four,and they were 30 years older than me.They are both in their sixties now.

zh-cn:为了写这本书我向姐姐询问 想了解父亲她眼中的父亲她说她眼里的父亲总是告诉他们周日会带他们去散步他们会穿得整整齐齐地等他但他几乎从来不出现他说他会给他们打电话 但他没有后来他不回家了有天他再也不出现了时光飞逝他们觉得他一定早就忘记他们了一开始是那样想再后来 时光匆匆大概两年后 他们想也许父亲已经死了然后我明白了问父亲那么多问题是在勾起他不愿重提的旧事因为那是很痛的回忆正当我的姐姐哥哥以为他们被抛弃成为了孤儿的时候我父亲却在伪造文件他没告诉他们 当然是为了保护他们
en:In order to write the book,I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was,who was the father she had known.She explained that the father that she&#39;d hadwould tell them he&#39;d come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.They would get all dressed up and wait for him,but he would almost never come.He&#39;d say, &quot;I&#39;ll call.&quot; He wouldn&#39;t call.And then he would not come.Then one day he totally disappeared.Time passed,and they thought he had surely forgotten them,at first.Then as time passed,at the end of almost two years, they thought,&quot;Well, perhaps our father has died.&quot;And then I understoodthat asking my father so many questionswas stirring up a whole past he probably didn&#39;t feel like talking aboutbecause it was painful.And while my half brother and sister thought they&#39;d been abandoned,orphaned,my father was making false papers.And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them.

en:After the liberation he made false papersto allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestinebefore the creation of Israel.And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist,he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.After the Algerian war,at the heart of the international resistance movements,his name circulatedand the whole world came knocking at his door.In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence:Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela&#39;s anti-apartheid party.He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans.

en:Once, though, he agreed to make false papersfor someone you might recognize.(Laughter)He was much younger in those days,and my father agreed to make false papersto enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevantand the least useful he&#39;d had to make in all his life.But, he agreed to do it,even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit&#39;s life was not in danger,just becauseit was a good opportunityto mock the authorities,and to show them that there&#39;s nothing more porous than borders —and that ideas have no borders.
