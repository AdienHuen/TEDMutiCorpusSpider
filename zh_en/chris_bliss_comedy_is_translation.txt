zh-cn:加布里尔•加西亚•马尔克斯（Gabriel García Márquez）是我最喜欢的作家之一我喜欢他的叙事更喜欢他的描写的优美和精确不管是《百年孤独》的开篇还是《族长没落》中的魔幻意识流文字汹涌而过一页又一页不间断的意象在读者的脑海中流过就像是在南美洲的原始森林中蜿蜒流过的一条野性的河流阅读马尔克斯的小说是一种特别震撼的感人肺腑的体验在阅读小说的体验中让我认识到自己正藉由翻译来经历一次十分特殊又生动的旅程
en:Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers,for his storytelling,but even more, I think,for the beauty and precision of his prose.And whether it&#39;s the opening line from &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;or the fantastical stream of consciousnessin &quot;Autumn of the Patriarch,&quot;where the words rush by,page after page of unpunctuated imagerysweeping the reader alonglike some wild rivertwisting through a primal South American jungle,reading Márquez is a visceral experience.Which struck me as particularly remarkableduring one session with the novelwhen I realized that I was being swept alongon this remarkable, vivid journeyin translation.

zh-cn:在大学时我的专业是比较文学这个专业与英文专业比较像只不过我们不用花上三个月的时间研究乔叟而是可以阅读全世界优秀文学作品的翻译版本这些书固然出色但你也总是可以感觉到翻译能够接近于原版完全的效果不过马尔克斯的书可不一样马尔克斯本人曾称赞英译本超越了他的原作这可是惊人的褒扬
en:Now I was a comparative literature major in college,which is like an English major,only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months,we got to read great literature in translationfrom around the world.And as great as these books were,you could always tellthat you were getting close to the full effect.But not so with Márquezwho once praised his translator&#39;s versionsas being better than his own,which is an astonishing compliment.

zh-cn:所以，在知道这位译者Gregory Rabassa自己写了一本关于翻译的书时我迫不及待地去读了这本书的书名来源于意大利的一句谚语他在前言里提到意思是“如果这是背叛”真是一次令人愉悦的阅读体验我要极力推荐给任何对翻译艺术感兴趣的人不过我提及这本书的原因是Rabassa早前曾提出过这样优雅简洁的见解“每一次沟通的行为都是一次翻译的行为”
en:So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa,had written his own book on the subject,I couldn&#39;t wait to read it.It&#39;s called apropos of the Italian adagethat I lifted from his forward,&quot;If This Be Treason.&quot;And it&#39;s a charming read.It&#39;s highly recommended for anyone who&#39;s interestedin the translator&#39;s art.But the reason that I mention itis that early on, Rabassa offersthis elegantly simple insight:&quot;Every act of communicationis an act of translation.&quot;

zh-cn:也许你们一直以来认为这是显而易见的但是对于我来说尽管每天都会遭遇沟通上的困难我也从没有看清沟通的这种内在挑战（这句话）真是醍醐灌顶从我记忆中能够有意识地思考开始我就对沟通这一课题倾注了主要的激情记得在孩提时代我就知道自己人生中真正想做的事就是去理解所有的事物然后去告诉所有的人这可不是狂妄自大有趣的是，我妻子Daisy她的娘家到处都是精神分裂症患者我是说到处都是曾经跟我说过：“Chris，我已经有了一个自认为是上帝的兄弟”我不需要一个想成为上帝的丈夫
en:Now maybe that&#39;s been obvious to all of you for a long time,but for me,as often as I&#39;d encounteredthat exact difficulty on a daily basis,I had never seen the inherent challenge of communicationin so crystalline a light.Ever since I can rememberthinking consciously about such things,communication has been my central passion.Even as a child,I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in lifewas to be able to understand everythingand then to communicate it to everyone else.So no ego problems.It&#39;s funny, my wife, Daisy,whose family is littered with schizophrenics —and I mean littered with them —once said to me, &quot;Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he&#39;s God.I don&#39;t need a husband who wants to be.&quot;

zh-cn:后来，在我二十多岁的时候我渐渐明白了我那童年理想的前半部分是无法实现的但是对于后半部分：能偶成功地向他人传达我自己获得的任何一种知识无力感油然而生一次又一次每当我开始跟别人分享一些伟大的真理对方本该感到感激的但结果往往适得其反有趣的是，只要你的开场白是嘿，听好了我要传授给你一些严肃的知识之后，快的超乎想象，你就能（在对方眼里）发现一种混合了冰冷和杀意的眼神
en:Anyway, as I plunged through my 20sever more aware of how unobtainablethe first part of my childhood ambition was,it was that second part,being able to successfully communicate to otherswhatever knowledge I was gaining,where the futility of my quest really set in.Time after time,whenever I set out to share some great truthwith a soon-to-be grateful recipient,it had the opposite effect.Interestingly, when your opening line of communication is,&quot;Hey, listen up,because I&#39;m about to drop some serious knowledge on you,&quot;it&#39;s amazing how quickly you&#39;ll discoverboth ice and the firing squad.

zh-cn:后来，在连续十年无差别疏远朋友和陌生人之后我终于悟到了这是很个人化的一个真理如果要跟别人很好地传达自己的想法我最好另辟蹊径就在这时候，我发现了喜剧
en:Finally, after about 10 yearsof alienating friends and strangers alike,I finally got it,a new personal truth all my own,that if I was going to ever communicate well with other peoplethe ideas that I was gaining,I&#39;d better find a different way of going about it.And that&#39;s when I discovered comedy.

zh-cn:喜剧的波段和其他种类的语言截然不同如果我把喜剧放在任意的一个光谱上我想它的位置介于诗歌和谎言之间在这里我说的不是所有的喜剧因为，明显的，有许多的幽默安全地待在我们日常的所知所感范围内我说的是那些最棒的喜剧和讽刺它们独具一种绕开人们正常视角的能力就像点金石一样它们运用我们传统智慧的普通金属通过滑稽的手段转换成一种不一样的看法甚至是一种不一样的存在因为这就是我从这次大会的主题中得到的：翻译中的收获沟通不仅能使个人自身产生更好的理解还能带来真正的改变根据我的经验沟通能够对话和拓展我们对于利己主义的概念这会儿我自视甚高地谈论利己主义因为我们天生利己这是我们求生本能中的一项这是它之所以对我们如此重要的原因也解释了为什么我们只有在事关自身利益的时候才会去聆听同时只有当符合自身利益时我们才会开始努力去回应我们对于他人的责任
en:Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelengthfrom other forms of language.If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum,I&#39;d say it falls somewherebetween poetry and lies.And I&#39;m not talking about all comedy here,because, clearly, there&#39;s plenty of humorthat colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.What I want to talk aboutis the unique ability that the best comedy and satire hasat circumventing our ingrained perspectives —comedy as the philosopher&#39;s stone.It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdomand transforms it through ridiculeinto a different way of seeingand ultimately being in the world.Because that&#39;s what I takefrom the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.That it&#39;s about communicationthat doesn&#39;t just produce greater understandingwithin the individual,but leads to real change.Which in my experience means communicationthat manages to speak to and expandour concept of self-interest.Now I&#39;m big on speaking to people&#39;s self-interestbecause we&#39;re all wired for that.It&#39;s part of our survival package,and that&#39;s why it&#39;s become so important for us,and that&#39;s why we&#39;re always listening at that level.And also because that&#39;s where,in terms of our own self-interest,we finally begin to graspour ability to respond, our responsibilityto the rest of the world.

zh-cn:我认为最好的喜剧和讽刺究竟是什么样的呢首先，最重要的是它们来源于真诚和正直回想一下Tina Fey在“周末夜现场”（ Saturday Night Live）节目中对新获提名的副总统候选人Sarah Palin那真是杀伤力十足Fey比任何一个政治权威人士都有效地表现了这个候选人在严肃性上的缺失大大加深了大部分美国民众今天对于此事的印象这个关键的细节就是Fey的剧本不是由她所作也并非出自栏目组的写手而是原封不动地来源于Palin自己的说辞（笑声）这是一个Palin的模仿者逐字逐句地引用Palin自己说过的话这就是真诚和正直这也是Fey的表演之所以能历久弥新的原因
en:Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire,I mean work that comes first and foremostfrom a place of honesty and integrity.Now if you think backon Tina Fey&#39;s impersonations on Saturday Night Liveof the newly nominated vice presidential candidateSarah Palin,they were devastating.Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political punditthe candidate&#39;s fundamental lack of seriousness,cementing an impressionthat the majority of the American public still holds today.And the key detail of thisis that Fey&#39;s scripts weren&#39;t written by herand they weren&#39;t written by the SNL writers.They were lifted verbatimfrom Palin&#39;s own remarks.(Laughter)Here was a Palin impersonatorquoting Palin word for word.Now that&#39;s honesty and integrity,and it&#39;s also why Fey&#39;s performancesleft such a lasting impression.

zh-cn:还有一个政治领域的例子当我第一次听到Rush Limbaugh把总统候选人John Edwards比作布雷克广告女郎（Breck Girl）的时候我就知道这段子会火我不常把Limbaugh和真诚正直联系在一起不过这句如珠妙语可真是无可争议这个描述完美地刻画了Edwards的虚荣心你猜怎么？事实证明，就是他的这种性格特征成为了终结他政治生涯的那件丑闻的核心原因
en:On the other side of the political spectrum,the first time that I heard Rush Limbaughrefer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girlI knew that he&#39;d made a direct hit.Now it&#39;s not often that I&#39;m going to associatethe words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh,but it&#39;s really hard to argue with that punchline.The description perfectly capturedEdwards&#39; personal vanity.And guess what?That ended up being the exact personality traitthat was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career.

zh-cn:“约翰 –斯图尔特每日秀”（The Daily Show with John Steward）是迄今为止最……（掌声）（笑声）是迄今为止关于此类喜剧的效力存档最为完整的例子一个又一个的民意调查从皮尤研究中心（ Pew Research）到安纳博格公共政策中心（Anneberg Center for Public Policy）都发现“每日秀”的观众对于时事更了解相比于网络和电视新闻的观众
en:Now The Daily Show with John Stewartis by far the most —(Applause)(Laughter)it&#39;s by far the most well-documented exampleof the effectiveness of this kind of comedy.Survey after survey,from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy,has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current eventsthan the viewers of all major network and cable news shows.

zh-cn:无论这个发现是说明了公司新闻的真实性和盈利性之间的冲突还是说明了斯图尔特的观众的关注度最重要的观点是斯图尔特的创作素材总是植根于真实事件但他的目的不是告知，不是的。他的目的是搞笑。斯图尔特的搞笑招牌只在素材是真实的条件下才发挥作用结论是，优秀的喜剧也是一种信息传播系统它在可靠性和记忆方面的得分远远超过专业新闻媒体这真是双重讽刺想想喜剧之所以能够触及人心靠的是有意误导
en:Now whether this says moreabout the conflict between integrity and profitabilityof corporate journalismthan it does about the attentiveness of Stewart&#39;s viewers,the larger point remainsthat Stewart&#39;s materialis always grounded in a commitment to the facts —not because his intent is to inform. It&#39;s not.His intent is to be funny.It just so happens that Stewart&#39;s brand of funnydoesn&#39;t work unless the facts are true.And the result is great comedythat&#39;s also an information delivery systemthat scores markedly higher in both credibility and retentionthan the professional news media.Now this is doubly ironicwhen you consider that what gives comedy its edgeat reaching around people&#39;s wallsis the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.

zh-cn:优秀的喜剧是语言的魔术你以为它是往这儿走但刹那间就出现在那儿精神上的欢乐引发了笑这种生理反应并非巧合地释放了脑内的内啡肽这样，你就会被诱导着从另一个角度看待问题因为内啡肽能让人放下自我防卫这种作用机制与愤怒、恐惧和惊慌这类“逃跑或战斗”反应的作用机制正好相反“逃跑或战斗”释放肾上腺素将自我防卫的高墙推到天那么高而喜剧涉及了许多我们拥有最强自我防卫的领域比如种族、宗教、政治、性只有用幽默，而不是用肾上腺素来接近这些领域，内啡肽和笑的魔力才会把自我防卫的高墙变成窗口展现出一个意料之外的全新视角
en:A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick,where you think it&#39;s going over hereand then all of a sudden you&#39;re transported over here.And there&#39;s this mental delightthat&#39;s followed by the physical response of laughter,which, not coincidentally,releases endorphins in the brain.And just like that, you&#39;ve been seducedinto a different way of looking at somethingbecause the endorphins have brought down your defenses.This is the exact oppositeof the way that anger and fear and panic,all of the flight-or-fight responses, operate.Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin,which throws our walls up sky-high.And the comedy comes along,dealing with a lot of the same areaswhere our defenses are the strongest —race, religion, politics, sexuality —only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin,we get endorphinsand the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows,revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view.

zh-cn:让我给你们一个我自己的例子我手头上有一些关于所谓“激进同性恋议程”的资料开篇是问“同性恋议程”到底有多激进？因为从我所了解到的，美国同性恋者最想做的三件事就是入伍、结婚、和建立家庭（笑声）这三件事我这辈子都不想做（笑声）放手去做吧，你们这些激进的混蛋。场地归你了
en:Now let me give you an example from my act.I have some materialabout the so-called radical gay agenda,which starts off by asking,how radical is the gay agenda?Because from what I can tell, the three things gay Americans seem to want mostare to join the military, get married and start a family.(Laughter)Three things I&#39;ve tried to avoid my entire life.(Laughter)Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours.

en:And that&#39;s followed by these linesabout gay adoption:What is the problem with gay adoption?Why is this remotely controversial?If you have a baby and you think that baby&#39;s gay,you should be allowed to put it up for adoption.(Laughter)You have given birth to an abomination.Remove it from your household.Now by taking the biblical epithet &quot;abomination&quot;and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence, a baby,this joke short circuits the emotional wiringbehind the debateand it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter,to question its validity.

zh-cn:误导可不是喜剧的袖中所藏的唯一伎俩语言的节极致简约是喜剧的另一件强有力的外衣没有什么比一个完美的笑点能集中包含更多的题材和象征Bill Hicks，如果你不知道这个人的作品你真的应该去google他Hicks表演中的一个惯例是要提到他童年时代在操场上的吹牛比赛有一个孩子冲他吼到“我爸爸能揍扁你爸爸！”Hicks回答说“真的？多快？”（笑声）整个童年都浓缩在这几个字当中了（笑声）更别提这句话透露出多少关于那个对此侃侃而谈的成年人了
en:Misdirection isn&#39;t the only trickthat comedy has up its sleeve.Economy of languageis another real strong suit of great comedy.There are few phrasesthat pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbolthan the perfect punchline.Bill Hicks — and if you don&#39;t know his work,you should really Google him —Hicks had a routineabout getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground,where finally the other kid says to him,&quot;Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad,&quot;to which Hicks replies,&quot;Really? How soon?&quot;(Laughter)That&#39;s an entire childhoodin three words.(Laughter)Not to mention what it revealsabout the adult who&#39;s speaking them.

zh-cn:最后，喜剧作为一种沟通方式还有一个强大的属性那就是它内在的扩散性人们迫不及待地传播新的好笑话这在现代社会可不是什么新生现象喜剧早就能以惊人的速度跨越国境了早在我们有互联网、社交媒体甚至是有线电视之前在1980年喜剧演员Richard Pryor不小心烧到了自己在一次活动中我在事件发生的第二天在洛杉矶两天后到达华盛顿特区我在东西海岸听到的笑点一模一样着火的黑人大学基金明显的，它不是出自“今夜秀”（Tonight Show）的独白我猜想——没有验证过——如果你真的回过头去做些研究你会发现喜剧是第二古老的传播性质的职业最早是鼓乐然后就是敲门笑话（谐音笑话）了
en:And one last powerful attributethat comedy has as communicationis that it&#39;s inherently viral.People can&#39;t waitto pass along that new great joke.And this isn&#39;t some new phenomenon of our wired world.Comedy has been crossing countrywith remarkable speedway before the Internet, social media,even cable TV.Back in 1980when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fireduring a freebasing accident,I was in Los Angeles the day after it happenedand then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that.And I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts —something about the Ignited Negro College Fund.Clearly, it didn&#39;t come out of a Tonight Show monologue.And my guess here — and I have no research on this —is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it,you&#39;d find out that comedyis the second oldest viral profession.First there were drumsand then knock-knock jokes.

zh-cn:当你把具备了所有的要素你有了一个适合传播的好笑话一个来自真诚和正直、精心安排的有力笑点就能够拥有改变对谈的真正效用我有一个好朋友，名叫Joel Pett他是一名社论漫画家为《列克星顿先驱领袖报》工作他曾经为《今日美国》（USA TODAY）早报周一版工作我和Joel一起去了哥本哈根就在气候大会召开的一个星期前2009年12月Joel跟我解释说因为《今日美国》是全美发行量最高的四份报纸之一基本上大会的每一个参加者都会读到这就意味着，如果他能画出轰动的作品在周一，也就是大会的第一天出版就可能让大会最高层人士也就是真正的决策者看到
en:But it&#39;s when you put all of these elements together —when you get the viral appeal of a great jokewith a powerful punchlinethat&#39;s crafted from honesty and integrity,it can have a real world impactat changing a conversation.Now I have a close friend, Joel Pett,who&#39;s the editorial cartoonistfor the Lexington Herald-Leader.And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy.I was visiting with Joelthe weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change openedin December of 2009.And Joel was explaining to methat, because USA Todaywas one of America&#39;s four papers of record,it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference,which meant that, if he hit it out of the park with his cartoonon Monday, the opening day of the conference,it could get passed aroundat the highest level among actual decision-makers.

zh-cn:于是我们开始讨论气候变化结果Joel和我两人都为同一件事烦恼太多的争论都集中在科学方面技术够不够完善我俩觉得这是离题的因为，首先，这里有一个错误的前提是完美的科学是存在的德克萨斯州长佩里（Perry）在去年夏天说过一模一样的话在他那注定失败的共和党总统提名选举伊始他就一遍遍地重申科学还不够完善同时德州有250个县——德州统共有254个县——发生了火灾佩里的对应政策是让德州民众祈求降雨就我自己而言，我祈祷的内容是让剩下的那4个县也着火吧这样那该死的科学就完善了
en:So we started talking about climate change.And it turned out that Joel and Iwere both bothered by the same thing,which was how so much of the debatewas still focused on the scienceand how complete it was or wasn&#39;t,which, to both of us,seems somewhat intentionally off point.Because first of all, there&#39;s this false premisethat such a thing as complete science exists.Now Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texaswas pushing this same line this past summerat the beginning of his oops-fated campaignfor the Republican presidential nomination,proclaiming over and over that the science wasn&#39;t completeat the same time that 250out of 254 counties in the state of Texaswere on fire.And Perry&#39;s policy solutionwas to ask the people of Texasto pray for rain.Personally, I was praying for four more firesso we could finally complete the damn science.

zh-cn:回到2009年Joel和我反复思考的问题是为什么事到如今还要花那么多精力来讨论科学而气候政策要解决的问题无疑是人类长期的利益其中无所谓科学我们反复讨论，最终Joel画出了这幅作品漫画：“假使这是一场大骗局，我们就会徒然创造一个更好的世界？”（笑声）你会爱上这个创意（鼓掌声）我们何不努力让世界变好，而不为了什么？不为上帝，不为国家，不为利益只是作为一种全球性决策的基本标准
en:But back in 2009,the question Joel and I kept turning over and overwas why this late in the gameso much energy was being spent talking about the sciencewhen the policies necessary to address climate changewere unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long runregardless of the science.So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this.Cartoon: &quot;What if it&#39;s a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?&quot;(Laughter)You&#39;ve got to love that idea.(Applause)How about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?Not for God, not for country, not for profit —just as a basic metric for global decision-making.

zh-cn:这幅漫画直击要害在大会结束不久后Joel收到一个索取签名副本的请求来自于华盛顿州环境保护局局长而这幅画现在还挂墙上又过了没多久，加州环保局也来索取了一份拷贝用于局长的演讲在一次国际气候会议上去年在萨克拉门托还不止这些至今为止，Joel收到了来自40多个环境组织的请求来自美国、加拿大和欧洲今年早些时候澳大利亚绿党向他索要拷贝用于他们的宣传活动引发热烈的讨论最终让澳大利亚国会采取了新的碳排放税收制度是全世界最苛刻的（鼓掌声）这14个单词可真够强劲的
en:And this cartoon hit the bull&#39;s eye.Shortly after the conference was over,Joel got a request for a signed copyfrom the head of the EPA in Washingtonwhose wall it now hangs on.And not long after that, he got another request for a copyfrom the head of the EPA in Californiawho used it as part of her presentationat an international conference on climate changein Sacramento last year.And it didn&#39;t stop there.To date, Joel&#39;s gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups,in the United States, Canada and Europe.And earlier this year,he got a request from the Green Party in Australiawho used it in their campaignwhere it became part of the debatethat resulted in the Australian parliamentadopting the most rigorous carbon tax regimeof any country in the world.(Applause)That is a lot of punchfor 14 words.
