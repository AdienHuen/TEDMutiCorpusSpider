zh-cn:我一直在想这个演讲的主题应该叫什么,就叫简单吧.差不多是这样,我几乎叫它头脑简单,但用更确切的词汇来形容.我试图弄清两个非常简单的事情:如何去生活,如何去死,结束.这是我整日尝试去弄明白的事.然而我也想想饭菜啊和零食啊什么的还有,你知道,对着我的孩子大声责骂并做日常的事情这些让你活在现实里
en:What I am always thinking aboutis what this session is about, which is called simplicity.And almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded,but in the best sense of the word.I&#39;m trying to figure out two very simple things:how to live and how to die, period.That&#39;s all I&#39;m trying to do, all day long.And I&#39;m also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks,and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal thingsthat keep you grounded.

zh-cn:事实上,我有幸生来就是爱空想的孩子.比我大的姐姐非常喜欢折腾我的父母,他们也正忙着折腾她.我有幸被完全忽略了—这是很微妙的东西,事实上,我想告诉你一件事.我可以完用通过白日梦的方式过着自己的生活.最终在一个很好的时期,我做着白日梦进了纽约大学. 那是1967年,在那里我遇到了一个人,他试图炸毁纽约大学的数学教学楼.然而我写了糟糕的诗,还织毛衣给他.女权主义者恨我们,并且整个事情是个杯具从头到尾.但我仍然坚持写着糟糕的诗,他也没有炸毁教学楼,但他去了古巴.我给了他钱因为我从Riverdale区回来所以我比他有钱.(笑声)去帮助别人的事业,你知道,是件好事.但是, 之后他回来了, 然后出事了,我真的恨透了我写的东西,真是很糟很糟的空洞修辞.并且我决定我要去倾诉但我仍然想讲故事我仍然想倒出我的故事.所以我决定开始画画. 这能有多难啊所以我开始慢慢变为一名编辑-插图画家, 这个你知道,十分无所谓,十分愚昧.
en:So, I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child.My older sister was busy torturing my parents,and they were busy torturing her.I was lucky enough to be completely ignored,which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.So, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967,where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.And feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretchedfrom beginning to end.But I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn&#39;t blow up the math building,but he went to Cuba.But I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdaleso I had more money than he did.(Laughter)And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.But, then he came back, and things happened,and I decided I really hated my writing,that it was awful, awful, purple prose.And I decided that I wanted to tell —but I still wanted to tell a narrative storyand I still wanted to tell my stories.So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?And so what happened was that I startedjust becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know,sheer whatever, sheer ignorance.

zh-cn:我们开了一个工作室 —好吧, Tibor 开了一个工作室, 叫 M&amp;公司.M&amp;公司的基本状况就是：我们什么都不懂.但没有关系,我们照样做.事实上, 一无所知其实更好,因为知道太多反而影响你的思路.所以,这个工作室的前提是,无所不为,无所畏惧.而我, 和我的全职工作, 我有了地球上最好的工作,就是做白日梦, 然后提出各种荒谬的创意幸运的是我们有足够多的人形成一个团队, 一个集体,不只是我提出疯狂的创意.那时的意义是,我可以做真正的自己 — 一个梦想家.我的意思是说这是M&amp;公司漫长历史的一部分,当然我们也需要赚钱,所以我们决定我们要创造一系列的产品.例如这些手表,尝试设计的更美丽更幽默 —也许不是尝试,而是希望成功 —才能去思索内容是什么,跳出你的思维定势,幽默和惊喜,高雅的美感和人文内涵对我们非常重要.设计的要求极高,完全摒除个人喜好内容的本身才是最重要的,不是周边配件,也不是包装材料.你必须成为记者,成为发明家你的想像力胜于一切
en:And we started a studio.Well, Tibor really started the studio, called M&amp;Co.And the premise of M&amp;Co was, we don&#39;t know anything,but that&#39;s all right, we&#39;re going to do it anyway.And as a matter of fact, it&#39;s better not to know anything,because if you know too much, you&#39;re stymied.So, the premise in the studio was,there are no boundaries, there is no fear.And I — and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth,was to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideasthat — fortunately, there were enough people there,and it was a team, it was a collective,it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.But the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.And so some of the things — I mean, it was a long history of M&amp;Co,and clearly we also needed to make some money,so we decided we would create a series of products.And some of the watches there,attempting to be beautiful and humorous —maybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.That to be able to talk about content,to break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise,elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.It was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in designand we wanted to say, the content is what&#39;s important,not the package, not the wrapping.You really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors,you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything.

zh-cn:所以, 好消息是我有一条狗虽然我知道我不并相信运气 —我也不知道自己信仰什么, 这个问题很复杂.但我知道我每次离开之前,都要摇七次他的尾巴.所以无论什么时候他看到小提箱的时候因为所有人离开的时候他总是摇狗尾巴然后跑进其它房间.但我可以从为儿童或成人工作之间来来回回的转换角色,因为,我可以说我不成熟,从某种角度来说,这是真的我不懂, 我真不理解那些 —我并不是以此为荣, 但我真的不懂.这个大会的95%的内容我都不懂.但我曾经讲过美丽的画做笔记,我在Murray Gell-Mann讲座里完成了一个很酷的洋葱插图.Jonathan Woodham的演讲里我也画了美丽的一页.于是, 美好的事情接连出现, 无法解释 —(笑声)— 我要画画的时候, 它会结束我的工作.所以,我打开思想,用无知无畏的心态来寻找一些创新的东西.
en:So, the good news is that I have a dogand, though I don&#39;t know if I believe in luck —I don&#39;t know what I believe in, it&#39;s a very complicated question,but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house,because everybody&#39;s always, you know, leaving,they&#39;re always cranking this wonderful dog&#39;s tail,and he runs to the other room.But I am able to make the transition from working for children and —from working for adults to children, and back and forth,because, you know, I can say that I&#39;m immature,and in a way, that&#39;s true.I don&#39;t really — I mean, I could tell you that I didn&#39;t understand,I&#39;m not proud of it, but I didn&#39;t understandlet&#39;s say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawingsand I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann&#39;s talk.And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham&#39;s talk.So, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension —(Laughter)— which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.So, I&#39;m open to the possibilities of not knowingand finding out something new.

zh-cn:儿童创作, 看起来简单做起来也简单.你通常需要将一个故事简化到32页以内,而你需要做的就是你要编辑故事的精华来呈现你想表达的东西,还好,你不是以居高临下的口气对着孩子说话你也不用自己的方式去表达孩子们看完一次就再也无法忍受的东西.所以,我满怀希望的写作书将有得于孩子和成人.但绘画所反映的,我不认为孩子和成人的内容有所差别.我试图用相同的想像力,相同的古怪念头,相同的爱的语言.我有很多很漂亮的朋友们.
en:So, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.You have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.And what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.And hopefully, you&#39;re not talking down to kidsand you&#39;re not talking in such a way that you,you know, couldn&#39;t stand reading it after one time.So, I hopefully am writing, you know,books that are good for children and for adults.But the painting reflects —I don&#39;t think differently for children than I do for adults.I try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy,the same kind of love of language.So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends.

zh-cn:这是Andrew Gatz, 他走进门.&quot;你,坐这儿&quot; 你知道,我拍很多照片.画面背景上的Bertoia椅子,是我最喜欢的椅子.我将喜欢的东西全部都放在一起,还好成人与儿童之间的对话会发生在很多层面上.并且将有更多不同形式的各种乐趣出现其中.这些书是我的人生的日记.我不喜欢情节,我不知道情节的意义.我无法忍受任何事情都必须有开场,开场, 中间和结局, 我真害怕.由于我的生活变数太多并且太迷茫,但我很喜欢这样的生活.
en:This is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said,&quot;You! Sit down there.&quot; You know, I take lots of photos.And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.So, I get to put in all of the things that I love.Hopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels,and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.And the books are really journals of my life.I never — I don&#39;t like plots.I don&#39;t know what a plot means.I can&#39;t stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning,you know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me,because my life is too random and too confused,and I enjoy it that way.

zh-cn:这是我们在威尼斯,这是我们的房间,我有这样的一个梦想我装着无比漂亮的绿色礼服,我正在朝窗外看,那感觉好极了.这样的故事,我才能把它放进文字中继续发展其它的东西.字母C有其它的含义.我很幸运,遇到一个男人坐在床上,尽管我给他画了头发,实际上他是个秃子 —好吧, 他有点头发, 或者, 他过去曾有头发.跟他一起我能做一些非常有趣的项目.我为《纽约客》设计封面, 然后9/11发生了我们都知道, 这跟世界末日一样.
en:But anyway, so we were in Venice,and this is our room. And I had this dreamthat I was wearing this fantastic green gown,and I was looking out the window,and it was really a beautiful thing.And so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet,and hopefully go on to something else.The letter C had other things in it.I was fortunate also, to meet the man who&#39;s sitting on the bed,though I gave him hair over here and he doesn&#39;t have hair.Well, he has some hair but — well, he used to have hair.And with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happenedand it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.

zh-cn:Rick和我在去参加晚会,在去布朗克斯区的路上,有些人说是布朗克西斯坦有些人说是法瑞里斯坦我们拿起来《纽约客》的封面,我们不知道我们正在做的是这样,我们也没刻意这样有趣, 并不是这么设计的.实际上我们希望设计变的有趣,这是真的.我们希望我们变的更有乐趣,但我们没有预料到它会成为封面,我们不知道那个图像,在那个时刻, 居然发生了,成为很多人喜欢浏览的插图.它真的变成了.... 我不知道.从那时起, 人们开始笑正在发生的事情.从“肥油西斯”到“的士斯坦”，你知道的还有“发酵臭桶工业废墟区”，“肉毒素西亚”，“波斯羊毛区”，“克林顿尼西亚”等纽约客斯坦的地名我们拿这个城市胡乱的把它变的像那些友好或不友好的其它国家 — 这儿发生过什么事?谁是这些人? 谁是这些部落?David Remnick, 一个真正喜欢它的人,有一点反对意见: 他不喜欢阿尔•芝海默（Al Zheimer两个词每空格就是老年痴呆症的意思）因为他认为这会侮辱老年痴呆症患者但我们说:&quot;David,你想想谁会晓得呢?&quot;没人知道.(笑声)所以还保留着, 这是件好事.在我的生命里,我永远不知道接下来会发生什么这也是生命的美好所在.
en:And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx,and somebody said Bronxistan,and somebody said Ferreristan,and we came up with this New Yorker cover,which we were able to — we didn&#39;t know what we were doing.We weren&#39;t trying to be funny, we weren&#39;t trying to be —well, we were trying to be funny actually, that&#39;s not true.We hoped we&#39;d be funny, but we didn&#39;t know it would be a cover,and we didn&#39;t know that that image, at the moment that it happened,would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.And it really became the — I don&#39;t know, you know,it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.And from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know,for the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know,we were able to take the cityand make fun of this completely foreign, who are — what&#39;s going on over here?Who are these people? What are these tribes?And David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it,had one problem. He didn&#39;t like Al Zheimers,because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer&#39;s.But you know, we said, &quot;David, who&#39;s going to know?They&#39;re not.&quot;(Laughter)So it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.You know, in the course of my life, I never know what&#39;s going to happenand that&#39;s kind of the beauty part.

zh-cn:我们在鳄鱼角,一个明显有很强的灵感的地方,在一次二手书清仓甩卖中, 我挑选了这本书, 《风格元素》（一本知名写作参考书）我从来没在学校里用过它,因为我一直忙于写诗和补考坐在咖啡厅.我开始读它,然后我发现,这本书真棒.大家应该来读读这本书.(笑声)所以我想, 如果加一些点缀, 加点少许的插画然后, 我说服了White Estate,然后还真是物以类聚啊波兰裔犹太人, 白种盎格鲁撒克逊新教徒我想为这本书做点什么.他们说可以, 然后他们让我完全自主发挥,这简直太棒了,无敌了.我完成了他们给我的例子基本上只需要画56张图.所以, 我不知道你能不能看到图上的字.&quot;Susan, 这次你糟蹋得真棒&quot;当你关注语法的时候,你会发现超级干涩,E.B. White写的这么优美,异想天开,你会深深投入在角色里,这里有很语法问题, 比如— &quot;Do you mind me asking a question?Do you mind my asking a question?&quot;&quot;Would, could, should, 还是 would, should, could.&quot;would 是Coco Chanel最喜欢用的词, Should 是Edith Sitwell最爱用的词,而Could 是August Sander的专利.还有, &quot;He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug.&quot;(笑声)
en:And we were on Cape Cod, a place, obviously, of great inspiration,and I picked up this book, &quot;The Elements of Style,&quot; at a yard sale.And I didn&#39;t — and I&#39;d never used it in school,because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out,and I don&#39;t know what, sitting in cafes.But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.I said, people should know about this book.(Laughter)So I decided it needed a few — it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.And basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate,and what an intersection of like, you know,Polish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying,I&#39;d like to do something to this book.And they said yes, and they left me completely alone,which was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.And I took the examples that they gave,and just did 56 paintings, basically.So, this is, I don&#39;t know if you can read this.&quot;Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in.&quot;And when you&#39;re dealing with grammar,which is, you know, incredibly dry,E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical — and actually, Strunk —and then you come to the rules and, you know,there are lots of grammar things. &quot;Do you mind me asking a question?Do you mind my asking a question?&quot;&quot;Would, could, should, or would, should, could.&quot;And &quot;would&quot; is Coco Chanel&#39;s lover, &quot;should&quot; is Edith Sitwell,and &quot;could&quot; is an August Sander subject.And, &quot;He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug.&quot;(Laughter)

zh-cn:这样有点英国式轻描淡写,神秘谋杀案的主题我真的是非常喜欢.要清楚, 要用人类能够理解的方式去表达.E.B. White 给我们定了一系列规则,这些规则让我们呆若木鸡并且在接下来的时间里恨他,或者你可以像我一样忽略它,或者,如果你能, 你可以选择吃一个三明志.我做的是我会在画画的时候唱歌,因为我真的喜欢唱歌,我认为音乐在是艺术的最高表达形式.所以我找到了优秀的作曲家, Nico Muhly,用文字写了九首歌,并且我们用他写的歌演奏了整个美妙的夜晚—他的音乐真是雅俗共赏.我用杯子和衣服在纽约公共图书馆的主阅览室也演奏了音乐,在这个本该非常安静的图书馆,这是一场非常美妙的活动.我喜欢希望有更多这样的活动.
en:So, there&#39;s a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery themethat I really love very much.And then, &quot;Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand.&quot;E.B. White wrote us a number of rules,which can either paralyze you and make you loathe himfor the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do,or you can, I don&#39;t know what, you know, eat a sandwich.So, what I did when I was painting was I started singing,because I really adore singing,and I think that music is the highest form of all art.So, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly,who wrote nine songs using the text,and we performed this fantastic evening of —he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.I played the clattering teacup and the slinkyin the main reading room of the New York Public Library,where you&#39;re supposed to be very, very quiet,and it was a phenomenally wonderful event,which we hopefully will do some more.

en:Who knows? The New York TimesSelect, the op-ed page,asked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.So, once a month for the last year,I&#39;ve been doing a column called &quot;The Principles of Uncertainty,&quot;which, you know, I don&#39;t know who Heisenberg is,but I know I can throw that around now. You know,it&#39;s the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.I&#39;m going to read quickly — and probably I&#39;m going to edit some,because I don&#39;t have that much time left — a few of the columns.And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing,because I said, &quot;Well, how much space do I have?&quot;And they said, &quot;Well, you know, it&#39;s the Internet.&quot;And I said, &quot;Yes, but how much space do I have?&quot;And they said, &quot;It&#39;s unlimited, it&#39;s unlimited.&quot;OK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I&#39;ll begin.&quot;How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo.&quot;And I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct,and then I talk about Spinoza.&quot;As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanationfor everything, called eudaemonia.And then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him,and I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal.&quot;I happen to know it for a fact.And then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct.

en:I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96,and when I brought her a copy of &quot;The Elements of Style,&quot;she said she would treasure it.And then I said — oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said,&quot;When you met him, you knew it was him.&quot;And she said, &quot;I knew it was he.&quot;(Laughter)So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.Gershwin died at the age of 38.He&#39;s buried in the same cemetery as my husband.I don&#39;t want to talk about that now.I do want to talk — the absolute icing on this cemetery cakeis the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.(Laughter)And I would like to run it for them.And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise,who&#39;s also still working, and I looked at her sink,which is really amazing, and left.And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.And then I go and have some tea.And then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died,she tried to pay with Sweet&#39;N Low packets for her bagel.(Laughter)And I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I seethat Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz&#39;s father,a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx,won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.That&#39;s actually Hy.And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit,and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.And it says, &quot;Ich habe genug,&quot; which is a Bach cantata,which I once thought meant &quot;I&#39;ve had it, I can&#39;t take it anymore,give me a break,&quot; but I was wrong.It means &quot;I have enough.&quot; And that is utterly true.I happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.(Applause)
