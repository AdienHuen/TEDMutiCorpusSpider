zh-cn:有一年我们的收成非常差那是2001年，我们遭受了可怕的饥荒持续5个月的全国性饥荒导致很多人饿死我家只在每晚吃一顿饭每人每天只能吃三口饭食物完全被身体吸收以至于没有排泄物
en:One year our fortune turned very bad.In 2001 we experienced an awful famine.Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death.My family ate one meal per day, at night.Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us.The food passes through our bodies.We drop down to nothing.

zh-cn:而其中的一本书改变了我这本书上说风车可以抽水和发电抽水意味着灌溉这就是抵御饥饿的方法那段时间我们开始做实验于是我决定为我们家建造一座风车但巧妇难为无米之炊然而，幸运的是我在废品站找到了所需的材料很多人包括我母亲都说我疯了(笑声)
en:Another book put that knowledge in my hands.It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.Pump water meant irrigation,a defense against hunger,which we were experiencing by that time.So I decided I would build one windmill for myself.But I didn&#39;t have materials to use,so I went to a scrap yardwhere I found my materials.Many people, including my mother,said I was crazy.(Laughter)

zh-cn:我找到了一个拖拉机风扇减震器还有PVC管以及用一个自行车骨架和一个旧自行车发电机就这样，我造好了起初只有一个点火器到后来发展到四个有开关还有断路器从而要付电费另一个机器作为抽水机用来灌溉
en:I found a tractor fan,shock absorber, PVC pipes.Using a bicycle frameand an old bicycle dynamo,I built my machine.It was one light at first.And then four lights,with switches, and even a circuit breaker,modeled after an electric bell.Another machine pumps waterfor irrigation.
