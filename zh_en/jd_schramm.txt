zh-cn:从所有的表象上约翰是事事顺心的他刚刚签下了售出他纽约住宅而带来6位数利润的合同他只用了5年的时间就做到了他硕士毕业的学校刚刚提供给他一个教书的职位这代表的，不仅仅是工资，还有随之而来的各种福利。然而，尽管对于约翰来说事事顺心但是他却在挣扎与毒瘾和严重的抑郁症在战斗
en:From all outward appearances,John had everything going for him.He had just signed the contractto sell his New York apartmentat a six-figure profit,and he&#39;d only owned it for five years.The school where he graduated from with his master&#39;shad just offered him a teaching appointment,which meant not only a salary,but benefits for the first time in ages.And yet, despite everything going really well for John,he was struggling,fighting addiction and a gripping depression.

zh-cn:2003年6月11日，夜他跨过了曼哈顿大桥边缘的围栏跳进了下方危险的激流中不可思议般的—不是，是奇迹般的 —他生还了。坠落的力度粉碎了他的右臂打断了他所有的肋骨刺穿了他的肺部当他的意识时有时无他顺流漂到东河直到布鲁克林大桥下到了史泰登岛渡轮的入船口渡轮上的乘客听到了他痛苦的叫喊报告了船长船长报告了海岸巡逻队巡逻队把他从东河打捞了起来并安置到了贝尔维医院
en:On the night of June 11th, 2003,he climbed up to the edgeof the fence on the Manhattan Bridgeand he leaped to the treacherous waters below.Remarkably —no, miraculously —he lived.The fall shattered his right arm,broke every rib that he had,punctured his lung,and he drifted in and out of consciousnessas he drifted down the East River,under the Brooklyn Bridgeand out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry,where passengers on the ferryheard his cries of pain,contacted the boat&#39;s captainwho contacted the Coast Guardwho fished him out of the East Riverand took him to Bellevue Hospital.

zh-cn:这事实上就是估计开始地方因为一旦约翰决心把自己拉回到原来的生活的时候 —起先生理上的，然后心理上的，接着精神上的 —他发现只有极少的可用资源来帮助那些像他一样曾经尝试自杀的人
en:And that&#39;s actually where our story begins.Because once John committed himselfto putting his life back together —first physically, then emotionally,and then spiritually —he found that there were very few resources availableto someone who has attempted to end their lifein the way that he did.

zh-cn:研究显示20个试图自杀的人中有19个会失败但是失败的人有37倍的可能性第二次自杀成功不可否认这是一群高危人士但却只有很少的资源去支撑他们当他们试着回到原有的生活的时候因为我们的自杀所带来的禁忌我们不确定应该说什么很多时候我们选择沉默未来像约翰这类人就会发现他们被孤立了
en:Research showsthat 19 out of 20 peoplewho attempt suicidewill fail.But the people who failare 37 times more likely to succeedthe second time.This truly isan at-risk populationwith very few resources to support them.And what happenswhen people try to assemble themselves back into life,because of our taboos around suicide,we&#39;re not sure what to say,and so quite often we say nothing.And that furthers the isolationthat people like John found themselves in.

zh-cn:我十分了解约翰的故事因为我就是约翰今天是我第一次在公共场合讲述我的经历但是2006年失去了一位敬爱的师长和去年自杀的好友之后在目睹了去年TEDActive活动之后我认识到我需要打破我的沉默无视我的禁忌讲述一个值得传播的想法就是对于那些作出困难选择的人来说回到过去的生活需要更多的资源以及我们的帮助
en:I know John&#39;s story very wellbecause I&#39;m John.And this is, today,the first time in any sort of public settingI&#39;ve ever acknowledgedthe journey that I have been on.But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006and a good friend last year to suicide,and sitting last year at TEDActive,I knew that I needed to step out of my silenceand past my taboosto talk about an idea worth spreading —and that is that peoplewho have made the difficult choiceto come back to lifeneed more resources and need our help.

en:As the Trevor Project says, it gets better.It gets way better.And I&#39;m choosing to come outof a totally different kind of closet todayto encourage you, to urge you,that if you are someonewho has contemplated or attempted suicide,or you know somebody who has,talk about it; get help.It&#39;s a conversation worth havingand an idea worth spreading.
