zh-cn:几个月前我去了趟西班牙在那里我吃到了今生吃过最好吃的鹅肝酱这是我一生中最美妙的饮食经验因为我相信我看到了饮食文化的未来莫名其妙，对吗？鹅肝酱和饮食文化的未来在今日的饮食文化中，没有比鹅肝酱更敏感的话题了几乎没人敢碰在芝加哥甚至有一阵子是违法的加利福尼亚州还没有决定，纽约刚公布法令感觉像是如果一个厨师把鹅肝酱放上菜单就有被攻击的危险真的，它才刚发生在旧金山一位知名厨师身上
en:I went to Spain a few months agoand I had the best foie gras of my life.The best culinary experience of my life.Because what I saw, I&#39;m convinced, is the future of cooking.Ridiculous, right?Foie gras and the future of cooking.There&#39;s not a food today that&#39;s more maligned than foie gras, right?I mean, it&#39;s crucified.It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.It&#39;s pending here in California, and just recently in New York.It&#39;s like if you&#39;re a chef and you put it on your menu,you risk being attacked.Really, it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef.

zh-cn:我不是说反对鹅肝酱是不合理的人们反对的是强制喂食你抓着鹅，或是鸭然后把大量的谷物往它脖子里倒这两个礼拜的谷物等于它们一生的食量于是它们的肝脏胀大了八倍简单来说，这不是一个美好的景象
en:I&#39;m not saying that there&#39;s not a rationalefor being opposed to foie gras.The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.Basically you take a goose or a duckand you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime.Its liver expands by eight times.Suffice to say it&#39;s like — it&#39;s not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.

zh-cn:问题是，对厨师来说，它实在超级无敌好吃（笑声）我是说，我爱死它了它油而不腻，带着丝般的甜味它让所有东西都变得好吃我们可以创造一个零鹅肝的可口菜单吗？当然可以就像你也可以不使用类固醇参加环法自行车赛啊（笑声）没什么人这样做这是有原因的（笑声）
en:The problem for us chefs is that it&#39;s so freakin&#39; delicious.(Laughter)I mean, I love the stuff.It is fatty, it&#39;s sweet, it&#39;s silky, it&#39;s unctuous.It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible.Can we produce a menu that&#39;s delicious without foie gras?Yes, sure.You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids, right?(Laughter)Not a lot of people are doing it.And for good reason.(Laughter)

zh-cn:几个月前，有个朋友介绍一个人给我Eduardo Sousa。Eduardo 做得是全天然的肥鹅肝全天然的肥鹅肝肥鹅肝有可能是天然的吗？他等到秋天天气变冷时鹅和鸭开始大量进食为冬天做准备其它时候它们漫游在 Eduardo 的农场上随意吃自己喜欢的没有任何的强制喂食没有工厂、残忍虐待
en:So several months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy,Eduardo Sousa.Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.Natural foie gras.What&#39;s natural about foie gras?To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall,geese and ducks gorge on foodto prepare for the harsh realities of winter.And the rest of the year they&#39;re free to roam around Eduardo&#39;s landand eat what they want.So no gavage, no force feeding,no factory-like conditions, no cruelty.
时间： 2:51
zh-cn:这是个惊人的新做法从他的曾祖父开始 － Patria de Sousa从1812年开始，他们不动声色地这样做直到去年当 Eduardo 赢了法国厨艺界的”一见钟情“奖那是食材的奥林匹克奖他得到鹅肝酱的第一名问题大了他告诉我，法国人非常生气（笑声）他愉快地告诉我
en:And it&#39;s shockingly not a new idea.His great-granddad started — Patería de Sousa — in 1812.And they&#39;ve been doing it quietly ever since.That is until last year,when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur,the coveted French gastronomic prize.It&#39;s like the Olympics of food products.He placed first for his foie gras.Big, big problem.As he said to me, that really pissed the French off.(Laughter)He said it sort of gleefully.

zh-cn:它占满了报纸头条我也读到了。在世界报上”西班牙厨师被控告……“法国人控告他“西班牙厨师被控告有作弊嫌疑”他们怀疑他收买了评审他们暗示这是西班牙政府做的惊人吧这个巨大的丑闻持续了几个礼拜没人能找到证据看看他他怎么也不像一个会拿钱收买法国评审的人为了他的鹅肝酱风波慢慢平息，很快地新的争议出现了他不能赢因为那不是鹅肝酱因为他没有使用强制喂食法所以那不能算是鹅肝酱因为定义不同，他说了谎而且应该取消资格
en:It was all over the papers.I read about it. It was in Le Monde.&quot;Spanish chef accused ... &quot; — and the French accused him.&quot;Spanish chef accused of cheating.&quot;They accused him of paying off the judges.They implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly.Huh, amazing.A huge scandal for a few weeks.Couldn&#39;t find a shred of evidence.Now, look at the guy.He doesn&#39;t look like a guy who&#39;s paying off French judgesfor his foie gras.So that died down, and very soon afterward,new controversy.He shouldn&#39;t win because it&#39;s not foie gras.It&#39;s not foie gras because it&#39;s not gavage.There&#39;s no force feeding.So by definition, he&#39;s lying and should be disqualified.

zh-cn:虽然现在想想，或读到会觉得有点好笑事实上，如果我们在争议发生前谈论此事我会说，那不是真的鹅肝酱一定得使用强制喂食法这就是你吃鹅肝酱所得到的直到我去了 Eduardo 位在艾斯马度华的农场在塞维尔50英里的北方，葡萄牙边境我亲眼见到一个非常复杂的系统同时也非常美丽而自然它非常简单他告诉我，从我见到他的第一刻起我只是给这些鹅它们想要的在我与他在一起的这两天，他重复了50次我只是给这些鹅它们想要的事实上，我到的时候他正躺在地上用手机拍摄他的鹅像他在草地上的孩子非常神奇。他深爱着这些 － 他就是所谓的“从一鹅终”（笑声）
en:As funny as it sounds, articulating it now and reading about it —actually, if we had talked about it before this controversy,I would have said, &quot;That&#39;s kind of true.&quot;You know, foie gras by definition, force feeding, it&#39;s gavage,and that&#39;s what you get when you want foie gras.That is, until I went to Eduardo&#39;s farm in Extremadura,50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border.I saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complexand then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature,is utterly simple.And he said to me, really from the first moment,my life&#39;s work is to give the geese what they want.He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.I&#39;m just here to give the geese what they want.Actually, when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phonetaking pictures of themlike his children in the grass.Amazing.He&#39;s really just in love with — he&#39;s at one with —he&#39;s the goose whisperer.(Laughter)

zh-cn:当我和他谈话的时候，你知道就像我现在和你说话一样但在我兴奋地向他提问的时候因为我越认识他和他的姐妹我就越对这个新知感到兴奋他多我做这个动作我想，哦，一个来自纽约的兴奋犹太人或许我有点太激进了，但没关系于是我慢了下来终于，在一天快结束时，我说Eduardo，这是什么意思？但他仍然做着一样的动作我终于懂了我说话太大声了于是我降低声音我经过一个翻译员，问他这些问题轻声细语地他不再做这个手势了神奇的是，那些刚刚站得离我们很远的鹅“不要靠近那些孩子！”当我降低声音，它们围了上来围到了这里沿着栅栏线
en:And when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought,like I&#39;m speaking to you now, right,but sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions,because the more I got to know him and his system,the more exciting this whole idea became.He kept going like this to me.And I thought, OK, excited Jew from New York, right?I&#39;m talking a little too aggressively, whatever,so you know, I slowed down.And finally, by the end of the day I was like,Ed-uar-do, you know like this?But he was still going like this.I figured it out.I was speaking too loudly.So I hushed my voice.I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translatorin kind of a half whisper.And he stopped doing this.And amazingly, the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around —&quot;Get the hell away from this kid!&quot; —when I lowered my voice, they all came right up to us.Right up to us, like right up to here.Right along the fence line.
时间： 6:36
zh-cn:连栅栏线本身也很神奇我们概念里的栅栏与他的概念正好是相反的玻璃纤维栅栏上是向外的一圈通电于是他重新设计发明我从来没有看过，你有吗？你把动物围住，向内通电他不是他把栅栏外面通电为什么？因他说他认为这些鹅这不只是一个想法，他证明了当这些鹅住在栅栏中，它们会感觉自己被监禁就算是被监禁在这个伊甸园一样美好的地方到处都是无花果他认为它们感觉自己受控于是他把电关掉把向内的电流关上只保留了向外的电流让通电栅栏可以保护它们不受小野狼和其它天敌
en:And fence line was amazing in itself.The fence — like this conception of fence that we haveit&#39;s totally backward with him.The electricity on this fiberglass fenceis only on the outside.He rewired it. He invented it.I&#39;ve never seen it. Have you?You fence in animals. You electrify the inside.He doesn&#39;t.He electrifies only the outside.Why?Because he said to me that he felt like the geese —and he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this —the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks.Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Edenwith figs and everything else.He felt like they felt manipulated.So he got rid of the electricity,he got rid of current on the insideand kept it on the outside,so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators.

zh-cn:然后呢？它们大吃。他给我看图表它们多吃了百分之二十，喂肥它们的肝这景色非常神奇他的牧场非常神奇感觉就像伊甸园一样有无花果和其它食物供应讽刺中的讽刺是，这个叫艾斯马度华的地方艾斯马度华是什么意思？艾斯马度华是“硬地”的意思非常坚硬的土地。但在他的家庭住了四代以后这块“硬地”变成了可口的菜单鹅的生活改善了它们可以随心所欲的吃自己想吃的
en:Now, what happened?They ate, and he showed me on a chart,how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers.The landscape is incredible.I mean, his farm is incredible.It really is the Garden of Eden.There&#39;s figs and everything else there for the taking.And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura, the area —what does Extremadura mean?Extra hard land, right?Extra difficult. Extra hard.But over four generations, he and his familyhave literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu.Upgrades the life for these geese.And they are allowed to take whatever they want.
时间： 8:10
zh-cn:还有另一个意外那些拿来喂鹅的无花果和橄榄如果 Eduardo 卖掉它们会比肥鹅肝本身更值钱但他不在乎他让它们想吃什么就吃什么，他说”大概会吃掉一半吧，它们很公平的。“他把另外的一半卖掉赚钱他牧场收入的一部分很大的一部分但他从来不控制那些鹅它们可以吃自己想吃的我再把它们留给我的卖掉
en:Another irony, the double ironyis that on the figs and the olives,Eduardo can make more money selling thosethan he can on the foie gras.He doesn&#39;t care.He lets them take what they want and he says,&quot;Usually, it&#39;s about 50 percent. They&#39;re very fair.&quot;The other 50 percent, he takes and he sells and he makes money on them.Part of the income for his farm.A big part of his income for his farm.But he never controls it.They get what they want,they leave the rest for me and I sell it.

zh-cn:他最大的困难在市场市场需求是又黄又亮的鹅肝酱我也是被这样训练的如果你要知道好的鹅肝酱是什么样子一定得是亮黄色的它证明那是最好的鹅肝酱因为他不强制喂食因为他不强喂大量的玉米他的鹅肝酱是灰色的应该说，本来是他后来找到了一种叫羽扁豆的野生植物艾斯马度华上到处都是这种羽扁豆他等它结种，他取得种子以后把它种在附近30公顷的土地上鹅非常喜欢羽扁豆不是它的叶子，而是它的种子当它们吃下这些种子，鹅肝便变黄荧光黄亮黄色我见过最好的肥鹅肝黄（笑声）
en:His biggest obstacle, really, was the marketplace,which demands these days bright yellow foie gras.That&#39;s how I&#39;ve been trained.You want to look and see what good foie gras is,it&#39;s got to be bright yellow.It&#39;s the indication that it&#39;s the best foie gras.Well, because he doesn&#39;t force feed,because he doesn&#39;t gavage tons of corn,his livers were pretty grey.Or they were.But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush.The Lupin bush, it&#39;s all around Extremadura.He let it go to seed, he took the seeds,he planted it on his 30 acres, all around.And the geese love the Lupin bush.Not for the bush, but for the seeds.And when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow.Radioactive yellow.Bright yellow.Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I&#39;ve ever seen.(Laughter)

zh-cn:我听着他说，心想他是说真的吗？还是编出来的？他好像有一切解答而且永远保持天然而不是人造。我有点 － 你知道我总觉得那些对成果却之不恭的人很奇怪他们要的不是自我表现吗？但他从未提到他对他的农场所做的这些独出心裁的发明
en:So I&#39;m listening to all this, you know, and I&#39;m like,is this guy for real? Is he making some of this up?Is he like, you know — because he seemed to have an answer for everything,and it was always nature.It was never him.And I was like, you know, I always get a little, like,weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves.Because, really, they want you to look at themselves, right?But he deflected everything away from his ingenuityinto working with his landscape.

zh-cn:我就坐在那里，有些狐疑的但渐渐地被说服我们就坐在那里，我听见不远处……的声音他抓住我和翻译员的手臂拉着我们躲到树丛里，他说“你看。”“嘘！”他再次提醒我“嘘，你看。“一队鹅飞了过来（击掌）声音越来越大，越来越大，就在我们后方当它们飞跃我们，感觉就像站在飞机跑道上它们被叫了回来 － 被一次次地叫了回来它们绕着飞他的鹅呼唤着野鹅（击掌）野鹅被叫了下来（击掌）它们绕着绕着，越来越大声然后它们降落我心想，”这怎么可能。“（笑声）怎么可能。
en:So it&#39;s like, here I am, I&#39;m on the fence about this guy,but increasingly, eating up his every word.And we&#39;re sitting there, and I hear [clapping] from a distance, so I look over.And he grabs my arm and the translator&#39;s,and ducks us under a bush and says, &quot;Watch this.&quot;&quot;Shush,&quot; he says again for the 500th time to me.&quot;Shush, watch this.&quot;And this squadron of geese come over.[Clapping]And they&#39;re getting louder, louder, louder, like really loud, right over us.And like airport traffic control, as they start to go past usthey&#39;re called back — and they&#39;re called back and back and back.And then they circle around.And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.[Clapping]And the wild geese are calling down.[Clapping]And it&#39;s getting louder and louder and they circle and circleand they land.And I&#39;m just saying, &quot;No way.&quot;(Laughter)No way.
时间：11:00
zh-cn:我看着 Eduardo，他眼眶含泪我说“你是说你的鹅在跟这些野鹅说来拜访我们一下？”他说“不，不它们是来住的。”它们要留在这里？（笑声）野鹅的基因应该是冬天往南飞啊我说，“这不是就是它们来到世界上的目的吗？冬天往南，温暖再往北飞？”他说，“不，不，不。它们的基因是为自己找到一个快乐生存的方法它们在这里找到了它们一无所缺了。”它们留下。它们和他的家鹅交配他的鹅群继续着想一想这不是很妙吗？想象在一个猪棚中在北卡罗来纳州好了野猪跑进了一个农业工厂决定定居（笑声）
en:And I look at Eduardo, who&#39;s near tears looking at this,and I say, &quot;You&#39;re telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geeseto say come for a visit?&quot;And he says, &quot;No, no, no.They&#39;ve come to stay.&quot;They&#39;ve come to stay?(Laughter)It&#39;s like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter, right?I said that. I said &quot;Isn&#39;t that what they&#39;re put on this Earth for?To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?&quot;He said, &quot;No, no, no.Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life.To happiness.They find it here.They don&#39;t need anything more.&quot;They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese,and his flock continues.Think about that for a minute.It&#39;s brilliant, right?Imagine — I don&#39;t know, imagine a hog farmin, like, North Carolina,and a wild pig comes upon a factory farmand decides to stay.(Laughter)

zh-cn:究竟吃起来怎样呢？在我离开前我终于品尝到了他带我去附近的一家餐厅他给了我一些鹅肝酱那真是太美妙了。这么说的问题在听上去可能有些夸张我很希望有个合适的比喻，但我没有我喝了太多他给我灌的迷汤他就算给我吃鹅毛我也会说这家伙是个天才，你知道我那时简直爱上他了
en:So how did it taste?I finally got to taste it before I left.He took me to his neighborhood restaurantand he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras.It was incredible.And the problem with saying that, of course, is thatyou know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily.And I&#39;d like to make a metaphor, but I don&#39;t have one really.I was drinking this guy&#39;s Kool-Aid so much,he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like,this guy&#39;s a genius, you know?I&#39;m really in love with him at this point.

zh-cn:但那的确是我吃过最好吃的鹅肝到了一种，我认为我从来没有真正吃过鹅肝只是一些叫做鹅肝的东西那改变了我，真的改变了我我对各位说，虽然有可能不会履行但我想我不会再把鹅肝放到菜单上因为和 Eduardo 的那次美食经验它甜美，不油腻它拥有肥鹅肝该有的一切但这些脂肪里却充满着诚实和尊严
en:But it truly was the best foie gras of my life.So much so that I don&#39;t think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment.I&#39;d had something that was called foie gras.But this was transformative. Really transformative.And I say to you, I might not stick to this,but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever serve foie gras on my menu againbecause of that taste experience with Eduardo.It was sweet, it was unctuous.It had all the qualities of foie gras,but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty.

zh-cn:你可以吃到香草，你可以吃到香料我发誓我吃到了八角茴香我很确定我不是那种舌头很灵的人，你知道但我还是尝得出来我百分之百确定那里有八角茴香的味道他说“没有。“我努力尝出不同香料终于，我说，好，盐和胡椒想着他应该在鹅肝里放了盐和胡椒吧但没有它把肥鹅肝拿出来放进罐子里做浓缩，渍料处理没有盐，没有胡椒，没有油，没有香料没有香料？
en:And you could taste herbs, you could taste spices.And I kept — I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise.I was sure of it.And I&#39;m not like some super taster, you know?But I can taste things.There&#39;s 100 percent star anise in there.And he says, &quot;No.&quot;And I ended up like going down the spices,and finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper,thinking he&#39;s salted and peppered his liver.But no.He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras,he sticks them in this jarand he confits it.No salt, no pepper, no oil, no spices.What?
时间：13:56
zh-cn:我们最后一次回到农庄他给我们看那些野生的胡椒以及他种来保持土地咸度的植物他不需要盐或胡椒也不需要香料，因为他的鹅就吃他种的这些混合香草饭后我转向他问他一个我反复问他他却没有正面回答的问题我说“你在西班牙，这里有全世界最好的厨师Ferran Adria，当代最好的厨师，就在你附近为什么你没有给他这个？为什么你默默无名？”可能是因为酒的关系可能是因为我的兴奋他直接回答我说：因为厨师配不上我的肥鹅肝。（笑声）他说的是对的是对的
en:We went back out for the final tour of the farm,and he showed me the wild pepper plantsand the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity.He doesn&#39;t need salt and pepper.And he doesn&#39;t need spices, because he&#39;s got this potpourri of herbs and flavorsthat his geese love to gorge on.I turned to him at the end of the meal,and it&#39;s a question I asked several times,and he hadn&#39;t, kind of, answered me directly,but I said, &quot;Now look, you&#39;re in Spain,some of the greatest chefs in the world are —Ferran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you.How come you don&#39;t give him this?How come no one&#39;s really heard of you?&quot;And it may be because of the wine,or it may be because of my excitement,he answered me directly and he said, &quot;Because chefs don&#39;t deserve my foie gras.&quot;(Laughter)And he was right.He was right.

zh-cn:厨师们用肥鹅肝做自己想要的把它变成一道菜。但我们今天所得到的这一切都是 Eduardo 力求天然的成果他说这是来自上天的礼物，上天说：你做得好。就是这样。在回程飞机上，我打开我黑色的小笔记本里面写满了一页又一页的笔记我非常感动在这些笔记的其中一个角落我写道，当他被问到对于今日一般人所吃的肥鹅肝那些世界上百分之99.99999的人所吃的肥鹅肝有什么意见？他说“我认为那是污辱历史。”我写着：对历史的污辱。我在飞机上感觉悔恨万分为什么我没追问下去？他为什么这么说？对历史的污辱
en:Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own.They create a dishwhere all the vectors point at us.With Eduardo it&#39;s about the expression of nature.And as he said, I think fittingly,it&#39;s a gift from God, with God saying, you&#39;ve done good work.Simple.I flew home, I&#39;m on the flight with my little black bookand I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it.I really was moved.And in the corner of one of these — one of my notes,is this note that says, when asked,what do you think of conventional foie gras?What do you think of foie gras that99.99999 percent of the world eats?He said, &quot;I think it&#39;s an insult to history.&quot;And I wrote, insult to history.I&#39;m on the plane and I&#39;m just tearing my hair out.It&#39;s like, why didn&#39;t I follow up on that?What the hell does that mean?Insult to history.

en:So I did some research when I got back,and here&#39;s what I found.The history of foie gras.Jews invented foie gras.True story.True story.By accident.They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz.Gotten sick of the chicken fat.They were looking for an alternative.And they saw in the fall that there was this natural,beautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese.And they slaughtered them, used the fat throughout the winter for cooking.The Pharaoh got wind of this —This is true, right off the Internet.The Pharaoh got — (Laughter)I swear to God.(Laughter)The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it.He tasted it and fell in love with it.He started demanding it.

en:And he didn&#39;t want it just in the fall, he wanted it all year round.And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.And the Jews, fearing for their life,had to come up with an ingenious idea,or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh&#39;s wishes, of course.And they invented, what? Gavage.They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives,and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver,and the good stuff they kept for themselves.Supposedly, anyway. I believe that one.

en:That&#39;s the history of foie gras.And if you think about it,it&#39;s the history of industrial agriculture.It&#39;s the history of what we eat today.Most of what we eat today.Mega-farms, feed lots, chemical amendments,long-distance travel, food processing.All of it, our food system.That&#39;s also an insult to history.It&#39;s an insult to the basic laws of natureand of biology.Whether we&#39;re talking about beef cattleor we&#39;re talking about chickens,or we&#39;re talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts,or in the case of this morning&#39;s New York Times, catfish —which wholesale are going out of business.

zh-cn:他是对的我们需要接受一种新的农业概念完全崭新我们不能再把地球当作一个几乎破产的公司停止利用便宜食物之名来浪费资源我们可以以 Eduardo 这样的农夫为例子农夫靠天吃饭靠自然提供答案与其勉强自然接受人为的解答我最喜欢的作家和思想家Janine Benyus 这么说“遵照自然的使用说明”这就是 Eduardo 所达成的他显示给我们我们在场每个人，包括我，看的对厨师和那些关系食物和厨艺的人们来说最好的事是最符合自然的食物选择也是最符合伦理道德的食物选择无论我们讨论的是抱子甘蓝还是肥鹅肝几乎总是，我从未发现其它可能这也是最美味的选择浑然天成。谢谢。（掌声）
en:And he&#39;s right.We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture.Really new.One in which we stop treating the planetas if it were some kind of business in liquidation.And stop degrading resources under the guise ofcheap food.We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo.Farmers that rely on naturefor solutions, for answers,rather than imposing solutions on nature.Listening as Janine Benyus,one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says,&quot;Listening to nature&#39;s operating instructions.&quot;That&#39;s what Eduardo does, and does so brilliantly.And what he showed me and what he can show all of us, I think,is that the great thing for chefs, the great blessing for chefs,and for people that care about food and cooking,is that the most ecological choice for foodis also the most ethical choice for food.Whether we&#39;re talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras.And it&#39;s also almost always, and I haven&#39;t found an example otherwise,but almost always, the most delicious choice.That&#39;s serendipitous.Thank you.(Applause)
