zh-cn:我今天想谈的概念是关于一种新式学校的想法它颠覆了我们传统观念中学校的定义和运作方式也许不久的将来它就会出现在你的周围它出自一个叫做青年基金的组织这个组织有数十年历史已经在教育领域提出了很多新观念，比如函授大学以及像拓展式学校之类的概念社会企业家学校，夏季大学和“万全学校”
en:What I want to talk about today is one idea.It&#39;s an idea for a new kind of school,which turns on its head much of our conventional thinkingabout what schools are for and how they work.And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon.Where it comes fromis an organization called the Young Foundation,which, over many decades,has come up with many innovations in education, like the Open Universityand things like Extended Schools,Schools for Social Entrepreneurs, Summer Universitiesand the School of Everything.

zh-cn:大约5年前，我们提出一个问题在英国的学校中，对于创新来说最重要的需求是什么我们认为最重要的优先选项是两套问题一个是大量的对学习厌烦的青少年他们不喜欢学校完全看不出在学校学的东西和将来的工作有任何联系同时雇主们依旧不停抱怨学校毕业的学生其实根本无法适应真正的工作缺乏正确的态度和经历
en:And about five years ago, we askedwhat was the most important need for innovationin schooling here in the U.K.And we felt the most important prioritywas to bring together two sets of problems.One was large numbers of bored teenagerswho just didn&#39;t like school,couldn&#39;t see any relationship between what they learned in schooland future jobs.And employers who kept complainingthat the kids coming out of school weren&#39;t actually ready for real work,didn&#39;t have the right attitudes and experience.

zh-cn:于是我们试着发问什么样的学校可以让青少年争着进来而不是抢着逃走？经过数百次与青少年、老师家长、雇主以及学校的交流从巴拉圭到澳大利亚同时查找了一些学术研究表明了我们现在所谓的非认知性机能的重要性—动机、应变能力的技能—这些技能和认知性机能同样重要—和正规学术技能一样—我们得出一个结论，某种程度上说一个非常简单的答案即我们所谓的工作室学校我们让工作室学校回归到文艺复兴时期对工作室最原始的定义上即工作和学习相结合的地方人们通过学习指导工作同时在工作中学习我们设计的这个想法有以下这些特点
en:And so we try to ask:What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in,not fighting to stay out?And after hundreds of conversationswith teenagers and teachers and parentsand employers and schoolsfrom Paraguay to Australia,and looking at some of the academic research,which showed the importanceof what&#39;s now called non-cognitive skills —the skills of motivation, resilience —and that these are as importantas the cognitive skills — formal academic skills —we came up with an answer, a very simple answer in a way,which we called the Studio School.And we called it a studio schoolto go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissancewhere work and learning are integrated.You work by learning,and you learn by working.And the design we came up with had the following characteristics.

zh-cn:首先，我们希望学校规模要小—大约300-400名学生—14-19岁重要的是，大约80%的课程不是坐在课堂完成的而是通过真实的，授权给商业机构非政府机构等其他机构的实际项目来完成每一个学生都会有一位导师和几位老师他们会有时间表这更像是在商业领域内的工作环境同时所有上述这些工作都会在公开体制下进行由公共资金资助但独立运作没有额外费用和选拔同时学生可以通过这类学校进入大学虽然他们中的很多人希望成为企业家或者获得一份蓝领工作这些是基于一个非常简单的概念即对于大多数青少年来说，最好的学习方式是实践团队方式最有利于学习同时做实际的工作也是最有利的—主流教育界做的实际上都是相反的
en:First of all, we wanted small schools —about 300, 400 pupils —14 to 19 year-olds,and critically, about 80 percent of the curriculum donenot through sitting in classrooms,but through real-life, practical projects,working on commissionto businesses, NGO&#39;s and others.That every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers,who would have timetablesmuch more like a work environment in a business.And all of this will be done within the public system,funded by public money,but independently run.And all at no extra cost, no selection,and allowing the pupils the route into university,even if many of them would want to become entrepreneursand have manual jobs as well.Underlying it was some very simple ideasthat large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things,they learn best in teamsand they learn best by doing things for real —all the opposite of what mainstream schoolingactually does.

zh-cn:现在有了一个好的想法于是我们进入到快速示范点建设阶段进行了试点首先是在卢顿—因机场闻名的城市—布莱克浦—因海滩和安逸的生活而闻名我们发现了什么—我们发现了很多问题然后进行了改进—但是我们发现年轻人很喜欢这个新想法他们觉得它较之传统教育来说更富主动性更令人兴奋可能这些好处中最重要的是两年后，当考试结果出来的时候在实践演练中表现的最差组的学生们一跃成为了尖子生—实际上，许多学生表现有顶级的分数表现在英国的一个叫做普通中等教育的测试系统中
en:Now that was a nice idea,so we moved into the rapid prototyping phase.We tried it out,first in Luton —famous for its airport and not much else, I fear —and in Blackpool — famous for its beaches and leisure.And what we found — and we got quite a lot of things wrongand then improved them —but we found that the young people loved it.They found it much more motivational, much more excitingthan traditional education.And perhaps most important of all,two years later when the exam results came through,the pupils who had been put on these field trialswho were in the lowest performing groupshad jumped right to the top —in fact, pretty much at the top decile of performancein terms of GCSE&#39;s,which is the British marking system.

zh-cn:现在不出意料的是已经影响到了一些人去思考我们正在做的事情教育部长在伦敦南部说自己是它的忠实粉丝同时企业组织认为我们所做的事情是在探索一条让孩子能更好的适应当今现实工作的路商会负责人现在成为了工作室学校的主席并提供帮助，不仅仅和大企业也和全国的小企业
en:Now not surprisingly,that influenced some people to think we were onto something.The minister of educationdown south in Londondescribed himself as a &quot;big fan.&quot;And the business organizations thought we were onto somethingin terms of a way of preparing children much betterfor real-life work today.And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerceis now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trustand helping it, not just with big businesses,but small businesses all over the country.

zh-cn:我们在两个学校试点今年增长到大约10家明年，预计大约35家贯穿英格兰同时其它40个地区希望有他们自己的学校—新理念被快速传播开来有趣的是这些传播几乎完全不依靠媒体的报道几乎完全没有雄厚资金的背后支持它的传播完全通过口口相传遍及老师，父母教育界的人它的传播是因为思想的力量—所以一个非常简单的想法它把教育放在首位并把那些边缘性的东西比如团队合作，实际操作放在学习的最核心位置而不是边缘
en:We started with two schools.That&#39;s grown this year to about 10.And next year, we&#39;re expecting about 35 schoolsopen across England,and another 40 areaswant to have their own schools opening —a pretty rapid spreadof this idea.Interestingly,it&#39;s happened almost entirely without media coverage.It&#39;s happened almost entirely without big money behind it.It spread almost entirely through word of mouth, virally,across teachers, parents,people involved in education.And it spread because of the power of an idea —so the very, very simple ideaabout turning education on its headand putting the things which were marginal,things like working in teams, doing practical projects,and putting them right at the heart of learning,rather than on the edges.

zh-cn:现在已经有一整套新式学校将于今年秋天开学这是约克郡的一个我希望我的侄子可以加入这家学校专注在创造性和媒体产业其它学校有专攻卫生保健旅游，工程学和其他领域
en:Now there&#39;s a whole set of new schoolsopening up this autumn.This is one from Yorkshirewhere, in fact, my nephew, I hope, will be able to attend it.And this one is focusedon creative and media industries.Other ones have a focus on health care,tourism, engineeringand other fields.

zh-cn:我们自认为所作的事情还并不完美但是我们坚信这个想法可以改变那些数千也许是数百万厌倦学校教育青少年的人生并不是告诉他们去做什么他们和在座的各位不一样他们不喜欢数小时听别人讲东西他们希望去做东西，他们想让双手忙活起来他们希望教育去适应现实我希望在座的朋友可以给予我们帮助
en:We think we&#39;re onto something.It&#39;s not perfect yet,but we think this is one ideawhich can transform the livesof thousands, possibly millions, of teenagerswho are really bored by schooling.It doesn&#39;t animate them.They&#39;re not like all of you who can sit in rowsand hear things said to you for hour after hour.They want to do things, they want to get their hands dirty,they want education to be for real.And my hope is that some of you out theremay be able to help us.

zh-cn:对于工作室学校想法的实验和改造我们所作的只是万里长征的一小步我们希望把这个想法变成一个答案也许它不能成为适合每一位儿童的普遍答案但是至少适合世界上无论何处的部分儿童的答案同时我希望你们中的小部分人至少可以帮我们把它实现
en:We feel we&#39;re on the beginning of a journeyof experiment and improvementto turn the Studio School ideainto something which is present,not as a universal answer for every child,but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world.And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen.
