zh-cn:当我还小的时候－我也曾有年幼的时候－我父亲告诉过我一个关于18世纪的一个制表匠的故事这位制表匠做了很多精美的手表一天，他的一位客人来到他的作坊要制表匠清洗他在此购买的手表制表匠拆开表取出的零件中有一个平衡轮客人注意到在平衡轮的背后刻着一些字客人问“你为什么在谁也看不见的地方刻上字？”制表匠转过身说“上帝看得见”我不是在拿宗教说事我父亲也不是但是那一刻，我感受到了什么我感受到在我的血脉和神经里的什么当然我觉得肯定也有肌肉我能感受到这是一种真实的反应从那一刻，那个年纪我开始用不同的方式思考
en:When I was little —and by the way, I was little once —my father told me a storyabout an 18th century watchmaker.And what this guy had done:he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches.And one day, one of his customers came into his workshopand asked him to clean the watch that he&#39;d bought.And the guy took it apart,and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels.And as he did so, his customer noticedthat on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving,were words.And he said to the guy,&quot;Why have you put stuff on the backthat no one will ever see?&quot;And the watchmaker turned around and said,&quot;God can see it.&quot;Now I&#39;m not in the least bit religious,neither was my father,but at that point, I noticed something happening here.I felt somethingin this plexus of blood vessels and nerves,and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere, I guess.But I felt something.And it was a physiological response.And from that point on, from my age at the time,I began to think of things in a different way.

zh-cn:随着我走上设计师的职业道路我开始问自己一个简单的问题：我们思考“美”吗？还是感受它？也许你现在已经知道了答案你可能会想，“不知道你是怎么认为但我觉得美是感受而来的”而随着我的设计师生涯的继续我开始发现一些令人惊讶的东西最早期的工作之一是机动车设计－有些很棒的设计在其中我们，或者说我发现了一些令我着迷的东西，也许你记得你记得车灯的开关吗关门的时候会响两声？然后我记得是某个BMW的设计师开发了一种慢慢灭掉的灯记得吗？我记得非常清楚你记得第一次坐在车里，发现灯会这样慢慢灭掉吗？我记得我坐在那儿想，心想这太棒了说实话，我还没发现谁不喜欢灯这样缓缓灭掉我想，这到底是为什么呢？
en:And as I took on my career as a designer,I began to ask myself the simple question:Do we actually think beauty,or do we feel it?Now you probably know the answer to this already.You probably think, well, I don&#39;t know which one you think it is,but I think it&#39;s about feeling beauty.And so I then moved on into my design careerand began to find some exciting things.One of the most early work was done in automotive design —some very exciting work was done there.And during a lot of this work,we found something, or I found something,that really fascinated me, and maybe you can remember it.Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off,click click, when you closed the door in a car?And then somebody, I think it was BMW,introduced a light that went out slowly.Remember that?I remember it clearly.Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that?I remember sitting there thinking, this is fantastic.In fact, I&#39;ve never found anybodythat doesn&#39;t like the light that goes out slowly.I thought, well what the hell&#39;s that about?

zh-cn:于是我开始问自己这样的问题首先我问别人“你喜欢这吗？”“喜欢啊”“为什么？”他们说“感觉挺自然的”或者“很棒”但我想这还不够得再深入一点因为作为一个设计师我需要知道这种感受究竟如何得来? 怎样描绘?于是我做了一些实验突然我意识到确实有深层的原因－6秒钟亮到暗－就是这个你知道这是什么吗？有人知道吗？
en:So I started to ask myself questions about it.And the first was, I&#39;d ask other people: &quot;Do you like it?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;&quot;Why?&quot; And they&#39;d say, &quot;Oh, it feels so natural,&quot;or, &quot;It&#39;s nice.&quot;I thought, well that&#39;s not good enough.Can we cut down a little bit further,because, as a designer, I need the vocabulary, I need the keyboard,of how this actually works.And so I did some experiments.And I suddenly realizedthat there was something that did exactly that —light to dark in six seconds —exactly that.Do you know what it is? Anyone?

zh-cn:想一想，想一下用大脑的思维功能但这不是思考，而是感受现在能不能请各位接下来的14分钟左右里关注你们的感受
en:You see, using this bit, the thinky bit,the slow bit of the brain — using that.And this isn&#39;t a think, it&#39;s a feel.And would you do me a favor?For the next 14 minutes or whatever it is,will you feel stuff?
时间： 3:01
zh-cn:我不希望你想太多，请感受吧。我感受到一种带着关注的放松感我发现的就是电影院或者剧院也正在如此－6秒钟灯由亮变暗这个过程中，你坐在那儿心想的是“不好，电影要开始了”还是“太棒了，真期待啊电影就要开始啦”？我不是神经科学家我甚至不知道这是不是叫做条件反射也许是吧因为跟我聊过的一些住在北半球的人对电影院里这些习以为常但我交谈过的另一些人还没看过电影或者没去过电影院他们的感受不完全一样每个人都喜欢但有些人更喜欢一些
en:I don&#39;t need you to think so much as I want you to feel it.I felt a sense of relaxationtempered with anticipation.And that thing that I foundwas the cinema or the theater.It&#39;s actually just happened here —light to dark in six seconds.And when that happens, are you sitting there going,&quot;No, the movie&#39;s about to start,&quot;or are you going, &quot;That&#39;s fantastic. I&#39;m looking forward to it.I get a sense of anticipation&quot;?Now I&#39;m not a neuroscientist.I don&#39;t know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex.But it might be.Because the people I speak to in the northern hemispherethat used to go in the cinema get this.And some of the people I speak tothat have never seen a movie or been to the theaterdon&#39;t get it in the same way.Everybody likes it,but some like it more than others.

zh-cn:这让我从另外一个角度思考这个问题我们不是在感受，而是用边缘系统在思考美－如果这不是个过时的想法的话愉悦感的中心是（体味美的）部件也许我的观察，感受跟思考无关从感官到这些部件比从思维也就是大脑皮层要快它们首先到达这其中原理是如何呢？这种反应有多大程度上产生于我们已知的或者我们将要学习的东西？
en:So this leads me to think of this in a different way.We&#39;re not feeling it. We&#39;re thinking beauty is in the limbic system —if that&#39;s not an outmoded idea.These are the bits, the pleasure centers,and maybe what I&#39;m seeing and sensing and feelingis bypassing my thinking.The wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bitsis shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit, the cortex.They arrive first.So how do we make that actually work?And how much of that reactive side of itis due to what we already know,or what we&#39;re going to learn, about something?

zh-cn:这是我所知道的最美妙的事情之一这是个塑料袋子当我第一眼看到它的时候，我想这一点都不美后来一看我发现如果我把它放到一个脏水坑里或者含有氯仿的水里或者各种各种样的脏东西接着脏水会通过反渗透进入袋子里变成纯净的可饮用的水突然这个袋子变的如此美妙
en:This is one of the most beautiful things I know.It&#39;s a plastic bag.And when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there&#39;s no beauty in that.Then I found out,post exposure,that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddleor a stream filled with coliformsand all sorts of disgusting stuff,that that filthy waterwill migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosisand end up inside it as pure, potable drinking water.And all of a sudden, this plastic bagwas extremely beautiful to me.

zh-cn:我想再次要求你们用感情体味暂时抛开思考我希望你们去感受看这它 你感觉如何？它美吗？ 令人振奋吗？我正仔细观察你们的面部表情有位先生看上去很无聊几位稍感兴趣的女士正在感受到什么也许这个画看上去很童真让我告诉你 准备好了吗？这是一个叫海蒂的五岁女孩在因脊椎癌去世之前的辞世之作这是她做的最后一件事最后一件具体活动看看这幅画看看其中的童真 看看它的美现在它美吗？
en:Now I&#39;m going to ask you againto switch on the emotional bit.Would you mind taking the brain out,and I just want you to feel something.Look at that. What are you feeling about it?Is it beautiful? Is it exciting?I&#39;m watching your faces very carefully.There&#39;s some rather bored-looking gentlemenand some slightly engaged-looking ladieswho are picking up something off that.Maybe there&#39;s an innocence to it.Now I&#39;m going to tell you what it is. Are you ready?This is the last act on this Earthof a little girl called Heidi, five years old,before she died of cancer to the spine.It&#39;s the last thing she did,the last physical act.Look at that picture.Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it.Is it beautiful now?

zh-cn:打住 你感受如何？你在用什么感受？我在用这里感受，这里我观察你们的脸因为你们的脸能告诉我那边一位女士正在哭泣但是你正在做什么呢？我观察人们的活动我观察面部我观察反应因为我必须知道人们对事物如何反应面对美的最常见的表情之一那种面对难以置信的美味时的表情就是“我的神啊”另外，脸上并不是一种愉悦不是“这太棒了”眉毛是这样，眼神散乱嘴唇微张这不是享受的表情有别的什么某种奇特的东西愉悦混合着一系列不同的情感
en:Stop. Stop. How do you feel?Where are you feeling this?I&#39;m feeling it here. I feel it here.And I&#39;m watching your faces,because your faces are telling me something.The lady over there is actually crying, by the way.But what are you doing?I watch what people do.I watch faces.I watch reactions.Because I have to know how people react to things.And one of the most common faceson something faced with beauty,something stupefyingly delicious,is what I call the OMG.And by the way, there&#39;s no pleasure in that face.It&#39;s not a &quot;this is wonderful!&quot;The eyebrows are doing this, the eyes are defocused,and the mouth is hanging open.That&#39;s not the expression of joy.There&#39;s something else in that.There&#39;s something weird happening.So pleasure seems to be temperedby a whole series of different things coming in.

zh-cn:作为一个设计师我喜欢Poignancy这个词它指的是某种能引起强烈情感反应的东西常常是指一种悲伤的反应但这只是我们反应的一部分这不仅是美好的也是矛盾的似是而非的美感官上我们感受一切－所有好的，坏的，兴奋的，惊悚的混合体－就是在触及感觉的那一刻我们体味一切情感就是你刚刚看到小女孩画的一部分当然胜利感，这种超越的感觉这种“原来如此，这个很新颖”的感觉这种感觉也混合其中当我们把这些不同的情感结合起来从设计的角度来看我对此十分兴奋因为这些东西，正如我们已经提及它们到达大脑不受成见影响 不受控制电化学的小把戏
en:Poignancy is a word I love as a designer.It means something triggering a big emotional response,often quite a sad emotional response,but it&#39;s part of what we do.It isn&#39;t just about nice.And this is the dilemma, this is the paradox, of beauty.Sensorily, we&#39;re taking in all sorts of things —mixtures of things that are good, bad, exciting, frightening —to come up with that sensorial exposure,that sensation of what&#39;s going on.Pathos appears obviouslyas part of what you just saw in that little girl&#39;s drawing.And also triumph, this sense of transcendence,this &quot;I never knew that. Ah, this is something new.&quot;And that&#39;s packed in there as well.And as we assemble these tools,from a design point of view, I get terribly excited about it,because these are things, as we&#39;ve already said,they&#39;re arriving at the brain, it would seem,before cognition, before we can manipulate them —electrochemical party tricks.

zh-cn:我同时还感兴趣的是有没有可能分离内在美和外在美？在此内在美是事物精致的美毫无置疑的美这非常少见 也许有一些例子很少有一个事物对所有人来说在没有信息背景情况下都认为美的东西所以很多事物都是外在的美这种美受人们对其所含信息的理解而影响或者信息增强了美的意义比如我给你们看的小女孩的画
en:Now what I&#39;m also interested in is:Is it possible to separateintrinsic and extrinsic beauty?By that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things,just something that&#39;s exquisitely beautiful,that&#39;s universally beautiful.Very hard to find. Maybe you&#39;ve got some examples of it.Very hard to find something that, to everybody,is a very beautiful thing,without a certain amount of information packed in there before.So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.It&#39;s mediated by information before the comprehension.Or the information&#39;s added on at the back,like that little girl&#39;s drawing that I showed you.

zh-cn:当谈论美的时候你不能否认很多这样的实验你们都如此反应我想最无趣的说法之一就是说对称的就是美的显然不是这个实验更有趣给一些人看这半张脸然后把这个完整的脸放到从最美到最丑的一系列脸中给他们看结果发现几乎是非常巧合的这跟对称没关系实际上这位女士的脸并不对称但两边都很美但不一样的美
en:Now when talking about beautyyou can&#39;t get away from the factthat a lot experiments have been done in this waywith faces and what have you.And one of the most tedious ones, I think,was saying that beauty was about symmetry.Well it obviously isn&#39;t.This is a more interesting onewhere half faces were shown to some people,and then to add them into a listof most beautiful to least beautifuland then exposing a full face.And they found that it was almost exact coincidence.So it wasn&#39;t about symmetry.In fact, this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face,of which both sides are beautiful.But they&#39;re both different.

zh-cn:作为一个设计师我忍不住一探究竟我把图片像这样分割然后尝试理解各个部分当我去感受时看着眼睛的话我能感受到愉快和美看眉毛则不然耳洞也不是我不知道这到底能给我帮上什么忙但这能帮助我理解（美的）信号来自哪里如我所说我不是个神经科学家但通过拆组各个部位我很快排除了是思考在作用而是种享受性的先验的要素在作用
en:And as a designer, I can&#39;t help meddling with this,so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this,and tried to understand what the individual elements were,but feeling it as I go.Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beautyif I look at that eye.I&#39;m not getting it off the eyebrow.And the earhole isn&#39;t doing it to me at all.So I don&#39;t know how much this is helping me,but it&#39;s helping to guide me to the placeswhere the signals are coming off.And as I say, I&#39;m not a neuroscientist,but to understand how I can start to assemble thingsthat will very quickly bypassthis thinking partand get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements.

en:Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time againthat we see things not as they are, but as we are.So I&#39;m going to shamelessly expose something to you,which is beautiful to me.And this is the F1 MV Agusta.Ahhhh.It is really — I mean, I can&#39;t express to youhow exquisite this object is.But I also know why it&#39;s exquisite to me,because it&#39;s a palimpsest of things.It&#39;s masses and masses of layers.This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.It&#39;s something much bigger.Layer after layer of legend, sport, details that resonate.I mean, if I just go through some of them now —I know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects,and that does it consummately well, you can see it can.So that&#39;s getting me excited.And I feel that here.

en:This bit, the big secret of automotive design —reflection management.It&#39;s not about the shapes,it&#39;s how the shapes reflect light.Now that thing, light flickers across it as you move,so it becomes a kinetic object,even though it&#39;s standing still —managed by how brilliantly that&#39;s done on the reflection.This little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a ridermeans there&#39;s something going on underneath it —in this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably,taking the power from the engine.I&#39;m getting terribly excitedas my mind and my eyes flick across these things.

en:The bit that you can&#39;t see is the genius that created this.Massimo Tamburini.They call him &quot;The Plumber&quot; in Italy,as well as &quot;Maestro,&quot;because he actually is engineerand craftsman and sculptor at the same time.There&#39;s so little compromise on this, you can&#39;t see it.

zh-cn:但是我们这样的人往往不得不向美妥协我们不得不这样所以我得寻找供应链，得和技术部分合作不断和其他的东西打交道这样一来就得不断妥协看看她我也得做点小妥协我把那部分只移动了一毫米没人注意吧？看我怎么做的吗？我把三个部位各移动了一毫米漂亮吧美吗？可能不那么美了当然消费者会说这个无妨这样没关系，是不是？再移一毫米呢？没人会注意这些切线和变化美是如此容易消逝因为获得美是很难的只有几个人能做到一个集中小组不行一个团队几乎不能做到只有一个大脑皮层能让各种因素同时和谐共鸣
en:But unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like mehave to deal with compromise all the time with beauty.We have to deal with it.So I have to work with a supply chain, and I&#39;ve got to work with the technologies,and I&#39;ve got to work with everything else all the time,and so compromises start to fit into it.And so look at her.I&#39;ve had to make a bit of a compromise there.I&#39;ve had to move that part across, but only a millimeter.No one&#39;s noticed, have they yet?Did you see what I did?I moved three things by a millimeter.Pretty? Yes.Beautiful? Maybe lesser.But then, of course, the consumer says that doesn&#39;t really matter.So that&#39;s okay, isn&#39;t it?Another millimeter?No one&#39;s going to notice those split lines and changes.It&#39;s that easy to lose beauty,because beauty&#39;s incredibly difficult to do.And only a few people can do it.And a focus group cannot do it.And a team rarely can do it.It takes a central cortex, if you like,to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time.

zh-cn:这是美丽的水瓶有人知道这个－设计师Ross Lovegrove的作品这个很接近内在美只要你知道什么是水你就能感受它它美是因为它装着清爽可口的东西我可能比你们更喜欢它因为我知道创造它有多难想要做出个具有那样折射度的物体是令人难以置信的难它需要适当的工具和精确地操作它的线型这背后是像天鹅的故事一样无数的困难所以说这是个神奇的例子，一个简单的物体之前看到的那个摩托是个复杂的物体因此它们以略微不同的方式体现了美
en:This is a beautiful water bottle —some of you know of it —done by Ross Lovegrove, the designer.This is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one,as long as you know what water is likethen you can experience this.It&#39;s lovely because it is an embodimentof something refreshing and delicious.I might like it more than you like it,because I know how bloody hard it is to do it.It&#39;s stupefyingly difficultto make something that refracts light like that,that comes out of the tool correctly,that goes down the line without falling over.Underneath this, like the story of the swan,is a million things very difficult to do.So all hail to that.It&#39;s a fantastic example, a simple object.And the one I showed you before was, of course, a massively complex one.And they&#39;re working in beautyin slightly different ways because of it.

en:You all, I guess, like me,enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.And part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty.You also may be taking into account the fact that it&#39;s incredibly painful.Anybody seen a ballet dancer&#39;s toeswhen they come out of the points?While she&#39;s doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you,something horrible&#39;s going on down here.The comprehension of itleads us to a greater and heightened senseof the beauty of what&#39;s actually going on.

en:Now I&#39;m using microseconds wrongly here,so please ignore me.But what I have to do now, feeling again,what I&#39;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes,of these triggers into something early on in the process,that you pick it up,not through your thinking, but through your feeling.So we&#39;re going to have a little experiment.Right, are you ready? I&#39;m going to show you something for a very, very brief moment.Are you ready? Okay.Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash?It&#39;s not.Tell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did.Did you think it was modern? Yes you did.That blip, that information, shot into you before that.And because your brain starter motor began there,now it&#39;s got to deal with it.And the great thing is, this motorcycle has been styled this wayspecifically to engender a sensethat it&#39;s green technology and it&#39;s good for youand it&#39;s light and it&#39;s all part of the future.

en:And finally, the layer that I love, of knowledge.Some of you, I&#39;m sure, will be familiar with this.What&#39;s incredible about this,and the way I love to come back to it,is this is taking something that you hate or bores you,folding clothes,and if you can actually do this —who can actually do this? Anybody try to do this?Yeah?It&#39;s fantastic, isn&#39;t it?Look at that. Do you want to see it again?No time. It says I have two minutes left, so we can&#39;t do this.But just go to the Web, YouTube,pull it down, &quot;folding T-shirt.&quot;That&#39;s how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt.You didn&#39;t maybe know it.But how do you feel about it?It feels fantastic when you do it, you look forward to doing it,and when you tell somebody else about it — like you probably have —you look really smart.The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside,the stuff that costs nothing,because that knowledge is free —bundle that together and where do we come out?

zh-cn:功能决定形态？只有有些时候是的形态就是功能这给了我们一个前所未有的答案作为设计师我不再使用“形态”和“功能”这样的词我追求的是事物的感官功能性如果能做到这一点我就能不断创造出美妙的东西你们知道那样的产品服务因为你们就有那些是你家失火的时候会抢出来的东西事物与你之间感情联结的形成是种电气化学效果它在你意识到之前就发生了
en:Form follows function?Only sometimes. Only sometimes.Form is function. Form is function.It informs, it tells us,it supplies us answers before we&#39;ve even thought about it.And so I&#39;ve stopped using words like &quot;form,&quot;and I&#39;ve stopped using words like &quot;function&quot; as a designer.What I try to pursue nowis the emotional functionality of things.Because if I can get that right,I can make them wonderful, and I can make them repeatedly wonderful.And you know what those products and services are,because you own some of them.They&#39;re the things that you&#39;d snatch if the house was on fire.Forming the emotional bondbetween this thing and youis an electrochemical party trickthat happens before you even think about it.
