zh-cn:这四个月来我一直怀着三个愿望到处奔走所有的思路都在这段时间中慢慢清晰我觉得每个人都可以学学我这么做如果给你三个愿望，你希望实现什么？思考这样一个问题，除了让我们知道自己想要什么还可以让我们意识到自己拥有什么思考这样一个问题，除了能在思想上有所获益还可以让我们行动起来有所行动，也许就能让生活变得不同赞美自然是今天的主题同时也是我一切灵感的源泉
en:Walk around for four months with three wishes,and all the ideas will start to percolate up.I think everybody should do it — think that you&#39;ve got three wishes.And what would you do? It&#39;s actually a great exerciseto really drill down to the things that you feel are important,and really reflect on the world around us.And thinking that, can an individual actually do something,or come up with something,that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?Inspired by nature — that&#39;s the theme here.And I think, quite frankly, that&#39;s where I started.

zh-cn:还在加拿大时，我就迷上了千里冰封万里雪飘的北国风光我的父亲非常热衷于户外运动因此我从小有不少机会和他去一起体验这片土地我也许永远弄不清我从这段经历之中学到了多少但是我想至少我懂得了一点在这苍茫天地之间，我们都只不过是一个过客看着面前的大自然那些人烟罕至的海岸与森林前不见古人，后不见来者念天地之悠悠我想每个人的感受都会有所不同
en:I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian.We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population,and my father was an avid outdoorsman.So I really had a chance to experience that.And I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.But what I think it was telling meis that we are this transient thing that&#39;s happening,and that the nature that you see out there — the untouched shorelines,the untouched forest that I was able to see —really bring in a sense of that geological time,that this has gone on for a long time,and we&#39;re experiencing it in a different way.

zh-cn:我现在所做的一切便是源于当时的感受我觉得自己应该这么做，而且也有能力这么做于是，在一个春天的早上，我走上了自己的征途我在路上拍摄了这样一丛野草这些原生态的风光画面成为了我随后几年的拍摄重心但是作为一位摄影艺术家，我始终感觉到这样的作品离我所要表达的内容还有一段距离同时，这样的作品也不利于一位艺术家的职业发展长期以来我的作品总难免被人当作挂历照片或者别的类似照片于是我开始认真思考，是否应该更换自己的拍摄思路我决定重新定位自己的拍摄方式专注于那些被人类力量改造的景观
en:And that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to haveto be able to make the work that I did.And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring,along a roadside.This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for yearstrying to photograph the pristine landscape.But as a fine-art photographer I somehow feltthat it wouldn&#39;t catch on out there,that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture,or something of that nature, and I couldn&#39;t get away from it.So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?I decided to rethink the landscapeas the landscape that we&#39;ve transformed.

zh-cn:当我一次迷失在宾夕法尼亚州的时候我突然发现了一丝灵感我在一个路口左转，本以为可以回到高速公路上结果却来到了一个叫做弗兰克威尔的小镇这儿曾经是一片矿区，当我下车四顾我看到了一幅前所未见的超现实场景完全被人类力量所改造的景观在这一幕的驱使下，我开始出发在我所能找到的风景带中寻找其它类似的矿区或大型工业痕迹这成为了我之后作品的出发点也成为了我始终坚持的作品主题这和我拍摄的初衷并不相违背追寻大型工业的足迹是一个很大的主题足够我认认真真做上一辈子
en:I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania,and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway.And I ended up in a town called Frackville.I got out of the car, and I stood up,and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround,and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I&#39;ve ever seen.Totally transformed by man.And that got me to go out and look at mines like this,and go out and look at the largest industrial incursionsin the landscape that I could find.And that became the baseline of what I was doing.And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto,and not have to re-invent myself —that this theme was large enough to become a life&#39;s work,to become something that I could sink my teeth intoand just research and find out where these industries are.

zh-cn:我想借这个机会对那些曾经帮助过我的公司表示衷心的感谢基本上，大家看到的每一张照片都需要经过协商才可能获得拍摄许可如果不是他们的帮助如果不是公司领导们的首肯我也许永远无法拍摄这些作品就我本意而言，我并不想针对这些公司说什么我本身也是一个公司的老板，和他们合作时我能感觉到他们对人们日常生活的重要性但同时我也注重可持续发展的重要性
en:And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks,which I kind of missed,was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs —to get into that place to make those photographs,and if it wasn&#39;t for those people letting me inat the heads of those corporations,I would have never made this body of work.So in that respect, to me, I&#39;m not against the corporation.I own a corporation. I work with them,and I feel that we all need them and they&#39;re important.But I am also for sustainability.

zh-cn:正是因为这一点，我最终与他们背道而驰我并不想在这里控诉他们的所作所为因为所有这一切，并不是突然发生的于是我开始思考，人类已经走过了很多个时代石器时代，铁器时代，青铜时代尽管这些时代留下的痕迹依旧保存着但我们已经无法从这些痕迹之中追寻那些过往的光辉这是一件非常可怕的事情当我们回过头来看看我们荒淫无度的生活对这片土地带来了什么样的后果我们就会突然间惊醒并思考
en:So there&#39;s this thing that is pulling me in both directions.And I&#39;m not making an indictment towards what&#39;s happening here,but it is a slow progression.So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man:the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.And these ages of man are still at work today.But we&#39;ve become totally disconnected from them.There&#39;s something that we&#39;re not seeing there.And it&#39;s a scary thing as well. Because when we start lookingat the collective appetite for our lifestyles,and what we&#39;re doing to that landscape —that, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.

zh-cn:我希望观众面对我的照片时能够感受到我这样的感觉而不是对这些影像感到排斥与抗拒不会大叫“老天，这拍的什么啊”而是感慨，“这一切看上去很美但是是一种残酷的美，让人无法安然享受”把这样的景象当作一种美，是不道德的我想这就是我所要表达的我希望人们不光是欣赏这些作品，而是思考与体会也许你们就能明白我面对这些景象时心中的感受曾经我也坚定的相信只有有房有车的生活才叫好生活这样想是要付出代价的我是什么时候开始被这样的生活所吸引?我不得不承认这让我感到羞愧而我试图通过自己的作品让我有所转变
en:And through my photographs,I&#39;m hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work,and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.Not to say, &quot;Oh my God, what is it?&quot; but to be challenged by it —to say, &quot;Wow, this is beautiful,&quot; on one level,but on the other level, &quot;This is scary. I shouldn&#39;t be enjoying it.&quot;Like a forbidden pleasure. And it&#39;s that forbidden pleasurethat I think is what resonates out there,and it gets people to look at these things,and it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too —that I&#39;m drawn to have a good life.I want a house, and I want a car.But there&#39;s this consequence out there.And how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?It&#39;s even in my own conscience I&#39;m having it,and here in my work, I&#39;m trying to build that same toggle.

en:These things that I photographed — this tire pile herehad 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.It was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fireabout four years ago. It&#39;s around Westley, California, around Modesto.And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had —if the earlier work of looking at the landscapehad a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature,in the recycling work that you&#39;re seeing herewas starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.That in the recycling work that I was doing,I&#39;m looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.That if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence,back into the system —if we keep doing that — we can continue on.Of course, listening at the conference,there&#39;s many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry,and there&#39;s many other things that are coming on stream —nanotechnology that may also prevent us from havingto go into that landscape and tear it apart.And we all look forward to those things.

zh-cn:但与此同时环境却在持续恶化在北美拍摄一段时间以后我开始把目光投向了世界你们现在看到的是我在孟加拉拍摄到的画面这些画面，这些关于孟加拉的画面源自我听到的一个广播节目当时里面谈到埃克森石油公司的瓦尔迪兹油轮泄露事件由于这次事件引起的索赔事件导致了全球油轮数量需求下滑所有这些多余的油轮都必须在2004年之前销毁当时我想，”天啊，这也太夸张了吧“一艘艘大型油轮由人工一点点将其拆毁这一切就在第三世界国家中真实发生因此我想去印度看看这一切不过由于当地绿色环保组织的活动，我被印度拒之门外因此我将目的地改为孟加拉国这是我与第三世界的第一次亲密接触这一切对我来说如此不可思议一亿三千万人，居住在和威斯康辛面积相等的一处地方到处都是人，到处都是污染工作环境极度恶劣
en:But in the meantime, these things are scaling up.These things are continuing to happen.What you&#39;re looking at here — I went to Bangladesh,so I started to move away from North America;I started to look at our world globally.These images of Bangladeshcame out of a radio program I was listening to.They were talking about Exxon Valdez,and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankersbecause of the insurance industries.And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned,and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.And I thought, &quot;My God, wouldn&#39;t that be something?&quot;To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand,literally, in third-world countries.So originally I was going to go to India.And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there,and then I was able to get into Bangladesh,and saw for the first time a third world, a view of it,that I had never actually thought was possible.130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin —people everywhere — the pollution was intense,and the working conditions were horrible.

en:Here you&#39;re looking at some oil fields in California,some of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that —there was another epiphany —that the whole world I was living in wasa result of having plentiful oil.And that, to me, was again something that I started building on,and I continued to build on.So this is a series I&#39;m hoping to have readyin about two or three years,under the heading of &quot;The Oil Party.&quot;Because I think everything that we&#39;re involved in —our clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything — are directly a result.I&#39;m going to move to some pictures of China.And for me China — I started photographing it four years ago,and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind,

zh-cn:另外，中国还给我从小熟悉的那些产业带来了巨大的冲击我来自一个工业城市通用汽车是当地的支柱产业，我爸爸就为其工作因此我对其非常熟悉这也同样影响到了我的作品但是同样的行业，以中国式规模出现，就完全不同了这里大家看到的是三峡大坝这是人类制造的最大大坝，规模超过第二名一倍以上全球大部分工程师都认为这项工程是不可能完成的原因只有一个，“这项工程太大”事实上，当这项工程于一年半前竣工蓄水人们确实能侦测到其诱发了地层深处的地震整个蓄水工程耗时十五天蓄水库区长达六百公里这也是人类历史上最大的水库之一这项巨大工程同时带来了另外一项巨大工程迁移库区内十三个城市的所有居民并将城市捣毁为平地以便船只通行
en:not to mention that China, as well,has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.I came out of a blue-collar town,a GM town, and my father worked at GM,so I was very familiar with that kind of industryand that also informed my work. But you know,to see China and the scale at which it&#39;s evolving, is quite something.So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam,and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.Most of the engineers around the world left the projectbecause they said, &quot;It&#39;s just too big.&quot;In fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago,they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.It took fifteen days to fill it.So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long,one of the largest reservoirs ever created.And what was also one of the bigger projects around thatwas moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir,and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.

zh-cn:这是其中一个城市迁移前后的景象。刚才是迁移前。这是大约十周后的景象，基本由人工拆除我印象中有十一栋楼房在拆除过程中使用了炸药其余完全靠人工进行，这仅仅只用了十周时间大家可以想象正是住在这里的居民亲手将自己生活的城市拆为一地瓦砾每拆一块石头，他们都能获得一定的报酬这是另外一些照片我一共用了三次旅行记录三峡地区的大规模地貌变化这里看上去像刚刚遭到轰炸，其实不是这是一片完全依靠意志而改变的土地这是何其强大的力量，才能让他们心甘情愿的承受这一切承受这样翻天覆地的变化
en:This is a &quot;before and after.&quot; So that was before.And this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite,everything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.And this gives you an idea.And it was all the people who lived in those homes,were the ones that were actually taking it apartand working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.And these are some of the images from that.So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam,looking at that massive transformation of a landscape.And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn&#39;t.What it is, it&#39;s a landscape that is an intentional one.This is a need for power, and they&#39;re willing to go through thismassive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.

zh-cn:不过这也许还算是好的就我所知，中国现在正计划再建二十七座核电站北美地区已经有二十年时间没有建立过一座核电站因为没有人希望给自家后院放上这么一把火但是中国可以说“不，我们就是要在十年里再建二十七座”而且火力发电厂依旧在以每周一座的速度兴建所以煤矿资源本身也是一个重大问题三峡工程导致的另一问题就是许多农田，大家可以在上图左边看到，永远流失了许多最为富饶的田地，就这样淹没在了水下大约两百万人流离失所这还仅仅是官方提供的数据这是等待着他们的新居
en:And again, it&#39;s actually a relief for what&#39;s going on in Chinabecause I think on the table right now,there&#39;s 27 nuclear power stations to be built.There hasn&#39;t been one built in North America for 20 yearsbecause of the &quot;NIMBY&quot; problem — &quot;Not In My BackYard.&quot;But in China they&#39;re saying, &quot;No, we&#39;re putting in 27 in the next 10 years.&quot;And coal-burning furnaces are going in therefor hydroelectric power literally weekly.So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges —a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost;some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated,depending on whose statistics you&#39;re looking at.And this is what they were building.

en:This is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.This is the town hall for the city.And again, the rebuilding of the city — to me, it was sad to seethat they didn&#39;t really grab a lot of, I guess,what we know here, in terms of urban planning.There were no parks; there were no green spaces.Very high-density living on the side of a hill.And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up,but somehow were not connecting with them.

This is a holdout.They&#39;re called dengzahoos — they&#39;re like pin tacks to the ground.They won&#39;t move. They&#39;re not negotiating.They&#39;re not getting enough, so they&#39;re not going to move.And so they&#39;re holding off until they get a deal with them.And they&#39;ve been actually quite successful in getting better dealsbecause most of them are getting a raw deal.They&#39;re being put out about two hours —the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years,or maybe even thousands of years,are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areasoutside of Shanghai.

en:This is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.Shanghai was a very intriguing city — it&#39;s exploding on a levelthat I don&#39;t think any city has experienced.In fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone —one of the first ones — 15 years ago was about 100,000 people,and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which —this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.There&#39;s 9,000 of them here,and they&#39;re being built for most of the big cities,Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.And this isn&#39;t even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.And what we would see here as a suburban development —a similar thing, but they&#39;re all high-rises.So they&#39;ll put 20 or 40 up at a time,and they just go up in the same wayas a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.

en:And the density is quite incredible.And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point outis that when I saw these kinds of buildings,I was shocked to seethat they&#39;re not using a central air-conditioning system;every window has an air conditioner in it.And I&#39;m sure there are people here who probablyknow better than I do about efficiencies,but I can&#39;t imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioneris a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.And when you start looking at that,and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai,it&#39;s literally a forest of skyscrapers.It&#39;s breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.And you can see in the foreground of this picture,it&#39;s still one of the last areas that was being held up.Right now that&#39;s all cleared out — this was done about eight months ago —and high-rises are now going up into that central spot.So a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.

en:Most recently I went in, and I started lookingat some of the biggest industries in China.And this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.This is the coal supply for the steel factory — 18 square kilometers.It&#39;s an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers,five cupolas, and the sixth one&#39;s coming in here.So they&#39;re building very large blast furnacesto try to deal with the demand for steel in China.So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.And again, looking at these images, there&#39;s this constant, like, haze that you&#39;re seeing.This is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It&#39;s a circuit breaker.10 hours a day at this speed.I think one of the issuesthat we here are facing with China,is that they&#39;re using a lot of the latest production technology.

en:In that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers,and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes,and picked this one woman.And it was just lightning fast;the way she was working was almost unbelievable.But that is the trick that they&#39;ve got right now,that they&#39;re winning with, is that they&#39;re usingall the latest technologies and extrusion machines,and bringing all the components into play,but the assembly is where they&#39;re actually bringing in —the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.There&#39;s a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.That condition&#39;s going to be there for the next 10 to 15 yearsif they realize what they want, which is, you know,400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.

en:In this particular case — this is the assembly line that you saw;this is a shot of it.I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.It took me five fake triesbecause they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.They were just wound up doing these things all day long,until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say,&quot;Okay, everybody freeze.&quot;It wasn&#39;t too bad,but they&#39;re driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.

zh-cn:这是一座合成丝纺织厂的照片，是一种石油加工的副产品大家在照片中看到的纺织厂代表了当前纺织厂的最高水准这里有五百台纺织机，每台价值二十万美元只需要十二个人就可以管理他们只需要在生产线上来回检查即可机器正在工作之中这样的工业场景是非常具有震撼力的所以我接二连三走访了一家又一家工厂把两张照片拼在一起，我做了不少类似的处理以图更好的表现此类场景的规模之大这里是来料车间工厂在这里统计来料送入纺织车间
en:This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.And what you&#39;re seeing here is,again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.There are 500 of these machines; they&#39;re worth about 200,000 dollars each.So you have about 12 people running this,and they&#39;re just inspecting it — and they&#39;re just walking the lines.The machines are all running,absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.And I started getting in further and further into the factories.And that&#39;s a diptych. I do a lot of pairingsto try and get the sense of scale in these places.This is a line where they get the threadsand they wind the threads together,pre-going into the textile mills.

zh-cn:这是一间制鞋工厂劳动力更加密集这里大约有一千五百名工人整个工厂的员工超过一万人主要面向国内市场想进入国际化企业拍照是非常困难的耐克或者阿迪达斯这样的公司基本不可能允许我进去拍照而且他们也不希望我进去拍照但是本土企业就容易得多这样的工作场景遍布全中国大家可以从这些照片中体会得到耐克是最早进入中国的制鞋企业之一劳动力成本非常高昂因此他们十分有必要选择一个低廉的劳动力市场
en:Here&#39;s something that&#39;s far more labor-intensive,which is the making of shoes.This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.The company itself had about 10,000 employees,and they&#39;re doing domestic shoes.It was very hard to get into the international companiesbecause I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas,and that&#39;s very hard to get.And they don&#39;t want to let me in.But the domestic was much easier to do.It just gives you a sense of, again — and that&#39;s where,really, the whole migration of jobs started going over to Chinaand making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.It was such a high labor component to itthat it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.

zh-cn:这是一家高科技手机企业，波导手机他们是中国最大的手机生产厂商之一由于中国手机持有量的爆炸性增长我想目前在中国也许每周都有一家新的手机公司成立这是一家生产衬衣的纺织加工企业雅戈尔，中国最大的成衣企业之一接下来一张照片是一间食堂这里一切都非常高效据我拍照时的观察这里的人进餐时间普遍为八到十分钟这是我见过的最大一间厂房主要生产咖啡机，他们是全球最大的咖啡机制造商同时也是最大的电熨斗制造商生产量达两千万台这里共有两万一千名员工，厂房全长半公里而这仅仅是他们诸多生产车间中的一处这些都是我最近拍摄的照片，我一个月前刚刚回来所以在座各位是第一批看到这些照片的人这些工厂的照片
en:This is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone,one of the largest mobile makers in China.I think mobile phone companiesare popping up, literally, on a weekly basis,and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.This is a textile where they&#39;re doing shirts —Youngor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.Everything is very efficient.While setting up this shot,people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.This was one of the biggest factories I&#39;ve ever seen.They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemakerand the biggest iron makers —they make 20 million of them in the world.There&#39;s 21,000 employees. This one factory — and they had several of them —is half a kilometer long.These are just recently shot — I just came back about a month ago,so you&#39;re the first ones to be seeing these,these new factory pictures I&#39;ve taken.

zh-cn:我花了将近一年的时间打通关系获准进入这些地方拍摄接下来让我们看看中国的另一面这是一个极度渴求资源的国家因此我们这里不少可回收资源都被收集起来装船运往中国刚才是金属块，这是转子，发电机中间的转轴他们从发电机中将其取出回收上面的铜及其它贵重金属这些废品毫无疑问与加州或者硅谷有关这是大多数计算机的最终归宿世界上大约一半的计算机最终在中国埋骨
en:So it&#39;s taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.The other aspect of what&#39;s happening in Chinais that there&#39;s a real need for materials there.So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected hereare being recycled and taken to China by ships.That&#39;s cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures,where they&#39;re getting the copper and the high-end steelfrom electrical motors out, and recycling them.This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.But this is what happens to most of the computers.Fifty percent of the world&#39;s computers end up in China to be recycled.

zh-cn:他们管这叫做电子垃圾但是由于他们的回收方式，这些垃圾确实会造成问题煤炉在中国使用非常广泛他们就是用煤炉加热电路板然后把零件从电路板上拔下来从中提取有价值的金属原料但是这么做会产生大量的有毒气体在从事这类行业的村庄周围五里或十里的地方你就能闻到那种刺鼻的气味这是另一处回收点他们大多是一些家庭作坊，占地面积不大也许就是在自家门口、后院甚至是房间里面焚烧回收这些电路板
en:It&#39;s referred to as &quot;e-waste&quot; there.And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boardsis that they actually use the coal briquettes,which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards,and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.They&#39;re trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.But the toxic smells — when you come into a townthat&#39;s actually doing this kind of burning of the boards,you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.Here&#39;s another operation. It&#39;s all cottage industries,so it&#39;s not big places — it&#39;s all in people&#39;s front porches,in their backyards, even in their homes they&#39;re burning boards,

zh-cn:也许有人会对此产生疑问确实这些行业在中国是违法的但事实上他们也无法制止这些行为继续下去这是一张人像，我很少拍人像但这一张实在让我无法自己这位老人家经历了毛泽东时代，经历了大跃进又经历了文化大革命，而现在她坐在自家的院子里旁边堆满了电子垃圾，这样的场景令人唏嘘这条道路两旁堆满了废弃的电脑主板这是最大的一处电子垃圾回收村这就是我想给大家看的所有照片
en:if there&#39;s a concern for somebody coming by —because it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it,but they can&#39;t stop the product from coming in.This portrait — I&#39;m not usually known for portraits,but I couldn&#39;t resist this one, where she&#39;s been through Mao,and she&#39;s been through the Great Leap Forward,and the Cultural Revolution, and now she&#39;s sitting on her porchwith this e-waste beside her. It&#39;s quite something.This is a road where it&#39;s been shored up by computer boardsin one of the biggest towns where they&#39;re recycling.So that&#39;s the photographs that I wanted to show you.

zh-cn:我想将我的心愿献给我的两个女儿在我所有思考的时光中，她们一直萦绕在我的心头右边的是玫根，左边的是卡嘉就我而言，所有这一切所有这些我拍摄的照片对于我们要做的事都有重大的意义而所有这一切在这一刻在这里都变得触手可及这一切将会改变诸多问题我希望我们所做的事情能够对整个世界产生一些积极的影响我认为，我们不光要改变我们身边的世界还应该积极行动起来，改变我们自己避免继续错下去尽管错误的行为还在继续，特别在亚洲，还在愈演愈烈尽管我知道这是一件无可奈何的事情但是我想这也正是为什么我们需要关注他们的发展因为他们的发展同时会影响到我们的发展
en:I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls.They&#39;ve been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I&#39;ve been thinking.One&#39;s Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.And to me the whole notion —the things I&#39;m photographing are out of a great concernabout the scale of our progress and what we call progress.And as much as there are great things around the corner —and it&#39;s palpable in this room —of all of the things that are just about to breakthat can solve so many problems,I&#39;m really hoping that those things will spread around the worldand will start to have a positive effect.And it isn&#39;t something that isn&#39;t just affecting our world,but it starts to go up — because I think we can start correctingour footprint and bring it down — but there&#39;s a growing footprintthat&#39;s happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate,and so I don&#39;t think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy,I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.

zh-cn:这一方面是我所想的内容，同时也是我的愿望带着这样的想法我开始思考这些问题“二十年后，或者十五年后当他们开始考虑婚姻、家庭和下一代他们那时会是过着一种什么样的日子呢？”无论是思索我的作品，还是思考这样一个难得的许愿机会这一问题都是我所有思考的核心所在我的第一个心愿：改变世界。我想要用我的照片让更多人开始关心可持续发展这样一个世界性话题得益于当今通信手段的发达我想这并不是一个遥不可及的愿望我在之前做过一些调查，我希望我的愿望能够脚踏实地的执行，而不是停留在纸上谈兵
en:So part of my thinking, and part of my wishes,is sitting with these thoughts in mind,and thinking about,&quot;How is their life going to be when they want to have children,or when they&#39;re ready to get married 20 years from now — or whatever,15 years from now?&quot;And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking —in my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my imagesto persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.And it is through communications todaythat I believe that that is not an unreal idea.Oh, and I went in search — I wanted to put what I had in mind,hitch it onto something. I didn&#39;t want a wish just to start from nowhere.
时间：26:53
zh-cn:尽管目前我的愿望目前还没有实现但是我已经找到了一个正在实行中的类似行动Worldchanging.com是一个很棒的博客成立十四个月目前每月访问量已接近五十万人这个网站最关键的一点就是他们的态度正是我所喜欢的态度他们并没有走以前那些环保运动的老路我觉得环保运动之所以失败主要是因为他们试图用耸人听闻的语调向人灌输环境保护的大道理而不是给人们展现环境保护的积极一面让人们试着慢慢改变而这个博客正是在向人们展示环保举措所带来的积极影响一些行之有效的方式，让我们的世界变得更好包括新的技术，新的节能设备新的思路，新的策略一切和可持续发展相关的举措
en:One of them I&#39;m starting from almost nothing, but the other one,I wanted to find out what&#39;s going on that&#39;s working right now.And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blogis now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.And it just started about 14 months ago.And the beauty of what&#39;s going on thereis that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.What they&#39;re doing there is that they&#39;re not —I think the environmental movement has failedin that it&#39;s used the stick too much;it&#39;s used the apocalyptic tone too much;it hasn&#39;t sold the positive aspects ofbeing environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blogis about positive movements,about how to change our world in a better way, quickly.And it&#39;s looking at technology, and it&#39;s looking at new energy-saving devices,and it&#39;s looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategizethe movement towards sustainability.

zh-cn:而我所能做到的就是将我的作品用在网站的推广宣传之中也许有些人已经知道，我和施德明，他同样也是TED的一份子共同设计了一些海报，当然这还是海报的草样而不是最终的设计结果，这些写有网址的图像可以被用在任何类型的媒体上可以放在网站上海报上、公交车站或者任何其他地方这是一个起点我们的想法是这样的大多数媒体都采用大量文字配上一副插图到处都是文字
en:And so for me, one of the things that I thoughtwould be to put some of my work in the service of promotingthe Worldchanging.com website.Some of you might know, he&#39;s a TEDster — Stephen Sagmeister and Iare working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages;these aren&#39;t the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com,can be placed into any kind of media.They could be posted through the Web;they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.So we&#39;re looking at this as trying to build out.And what we ended up discussingwas that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text,and the text is blasted all over.
时间：28:58
zh-cn:根据施德明的统计，只有不到百分之五的广告是图像主导的，十分稀少我们这样设计是想要通过大量的图片来传递信息引人思考让人们在看到图片的同时就会想到“Worldchanging.com，还有这些图片，这代表什么呢？”并希望人们能够带着问题打开网站尽管Worldchanging.com现在只是一个博客但我希望他能够更大的发展，我从不仅仅把它当做一个博客因为这里有我们无数人前仆后继的努力我相信它能够发出自己的声音，能够带来自己的影响现在，就在这个网站上已经有来自印度、中国、北美的讨论有来自世界各地的访问者与信息我相信总有一天我们可以借着Worldchanging.com实现一场关于可持续发展的大对话，大讨论如果你愿意为促进这一切做点什么，那真是再好不过
en:What was unusual, according to Stephen,is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.And so in this case,because it&#39;s about a lot of these images and what they represent,and the kinds of questions they bring up,that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say,&quot;Well, what&#39;s Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?&quot;And hopefully inspire people to go to that website.So Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog,and I&#39;m hoping that it isn&#39;t — I don&#39;t see it as the kind of blogwhere we&#39;re all going to follow each other to death.This one is one that will spoke out, and will go out,and to start reaching. Because right now there&#39;s conversationsin India, in China, in South America —there&#39;s entries coming from all around the world.I think there&#39;s a chance to have a dialogue, a conversationabout sustainability at Worldchanging.com.And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.

zh-cn:我的下一个愿望更多是为了我们下一代考虑这个愿望是：我想发起一个开创性的运动鼓励孩子们就可持续发展贡献自己的想法这个想法是由我的提名人艾莉森在一次头脑风暴中提出来的在她当时谈到了加拿大的垃圾回收问题的时候我突然想到了四年级到六年级之间的小朋友们大家都知道四年级，也就是七岁左右的小孩他们刚刚开始发育，也刚刚开始认识社会所以对于这个阶段的小孩而言我们的言传身教就变得很重要这一点我想大家都知道
en:Wish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I&#39;m trying to work with.And this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competitionthat motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.And one of the things that came out —Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier onin a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canadahad a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.And you think about it, you know,grade four — my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason,so they&#39;re into the age of reason. And they&#39;re pre-puberty.So it&#39;s this great window where they actually are —you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?You know, we know that from earlier presentations.

zh-cn:我以我觉得我们可以从娃娃入手让他们从小就知道什么是可持续发展并且培养他们对可持续发展的兴趣我想到的一个方法就是用我得到的奖金大约三万到四万美元作为奖金剩下的作为管理基金启动这一项目通过奖金激励孩子们参与到活动中来按照我的想法活动最终可以评选出一个最佳校园可持续发展建议奖一个最佳家庭可持续发展建议奖以及一个最佳社区可持续发展项目
en:So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kidsto start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is,and that they have a vested interest in it to happen.And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize,so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings,and the rest is going to be to manage this project,but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.But the other thing that I thought would be fantasticwas to create these — call them &quot;prize targets.&quot;And so one could be for the best sustainable ideafor an in-school project, the best one for a household project,or it could be the best community project for sustainability.
时间：31:30
zh-cn:同时我还想设立一个“我的世界”艺术奖这是一个弹性很大的项目如果我们能吸引一部分人为这一项目投入设备或资金就可以让这个项目变得引人注目让所有的学校，包括公立学校以及所有适龄儿童就读的学校都参与到这个竞赛中来从中收集参赛作品并评出名次大奖应该颁发给一个实际项目，而不是一些不切实际的想法艺术作品可以是他们的思路，或者实践的过程但是所有的一切必须要落在实处这么做，我们实际上是在鼓励这样一个年龄段的小孩开始思考通过他们来推广可持续发展的理念我相信他们的行为可以影响到他们的父母，他们的家庭大人们会帮助他们参与到活动中来
en:And I also thought there should be a nice prizefor the best artwork for &quot;In My World.&quot; And what would happen —it&#39;s a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things —whether it&#39;s equipment, like a media lab,or money to make the prize significant enough —and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools,or schools that are with kids that age,and make it a wide-open competition for themto go after those prizes and to submit them.And the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it&#39;s not about just ideas.The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present themand do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.In that way, what&#39;s happening is thatwe&#39;re motivating a certain age group to start thinking.And they&#39;re going to push that up, from the bottom — up into,I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it,and trying to help them with the projects.
时间：32:25
zh-cn:而这一切最终会让大家主动的去关注与传播可持续发展的理念也许大家都会自觉的回收垃圾我想不是所有人都会关注可持续发展的方方面面并去了解可持续发展的意义与影响但我很希望每个人都能理解这一点这也正是我在一直努力去做的让我们回到“我的世界”这个比赛话题我们可以使用比赛中搜集到的艺术作品为其作为宣传我喜欢“我的世界”这个主题这个主题可以让我们认识到自己是这个世界的主人这是我的世界，而不是别人的世界，我应该保护她我应该为她做些什么我想这是一个很好的机会去鼓励孩子们运用自己的想象力为这个项目也为自己的校园生活，贡献一些力量我觉得每个学校都应该拿出一些经费和设备引导学生们参与到这一活动中来而我们与此同时就可以借着这样一些机会宣传“我的世界”这样一个活动
en:And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainabilityin a very positive way,and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now,but they don&#39;t really, I think, get sustainability in all the things,and the energy footprint, and how that matters.And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish,and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.And again, in &quot;In My World,&quot; the competition —we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.And I like the words, &quot;in my world,&quot;because it gives possession of the world to the person who&#39;s doing it.It is my world; it&#39;s not someone else&#39;s. I want to help it;I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunityto engage the imaginations — and great ideas, I think, come from kids —and engage their imagination into a project,and do something for schools.I think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash —it&#39;s going to be an incentive for them to do that.And these are some of the ideas in terms of wherewe could possibly put in some promotion for &quot;In My World.&quot;

zh-cn:我的第三个心愿是拍一部IMAX电影我一直对自己说，我应该拍一部这样的电影，这是我一直以来的心愿当我第一次看到IMAX电影，我就发现这和我的作品和我一直从事的工作，有一些相同之处我想，一切无论是内容还是形式这都与我作为一个摄影师所做的及其相似如果给我一个机会我一定会给观众带来震撼的感受当然，我非常需要有人来帮帮我我刚刚过了五十岁生日，我已经没有什么时间花在学习上了我确实很忙，所以我需要有人可以帮我迅速掌握相关的操作技能给我的拍摄工作指出一条明路，这一定很有趣。以上，就是我的三个愿望
en:And wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself,and I&#39;ve always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I&#39;m playing with —when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought,&quot;There&#39;s a real resonance between what I&#39;m trying to doand the scale of what I try to do as a photographer.&quot;And I think there&#39;s a real possibilityto reach new audiences if I had a chance.So I&#39;m looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.I&#39;m 50, and I don&#39;t have time to go back to school right now —I&#39;m too busy. So I need somebodywho can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that,and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.
