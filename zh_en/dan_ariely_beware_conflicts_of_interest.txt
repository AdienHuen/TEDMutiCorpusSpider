zh-cn:我之前很长一段时间都在住院出院的几年后，我故地重游烧伤部门的主任激动的接见了我—说到 &#39;&#39;丹，我为你准备了一种新型神奇的治疗方法&quot;我怀着激动的心情随他走进了他的办公室当我刮胡子的时候，他给我做了具体解释我在左边发髻旁边有些小黑点而我的脸右侧我曾严重烧伤过 所以几乎没有须发这就缺乏对称而他的天才之处在哪儿呢?他打算在我脸右边纹上一些小黑点来让我看起来有对称的美感
en:So, I was in the hospital for a long time.And a few years after I left, I went back,and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me —said, &quot;Dan, I have a fantastic new treatment for you.&quot;I was very excited. I walked with him to his office.And he explained to me that, when I shave,I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is,but on the right side of my faceI was badly burned so I have no hair,and this creates lack of symmetry.And what&#39;s the brilliant idea he had?He was going to tattoo little black dotson the right side of my faceand make me look very symmetric.

zh-cn:这主意听着很有意思 他让我去把胡子剃了告诉我 这是一种奇怪的剃须方式因为我曾想过而且觉得我的剃须方法会定型成后半辈子的剃须方法—因为我必须要保证两边宽度相同当我回到他办公司的时候我还不是很确定我就问到 &quot;能给我看些样本吗?&quot;他给我看了些脸上带些小黑点的照片—消息不是很充分我问道 &quot;我老了之后头发变白了 那怎么办?&quot;&quot;到时候 会怎么样?&quot;&quot;哦 不用担心这点&quot; 他回答道&quot;沃恩能用激光把它变成白色&quot;但我还是有点担心说到 &quot;你猜怎么着 我不打算做了&quot;
en:It sounded interesting. He asked me to go and shave.Let me tell you, this was a strange way to shave,because I thought about itand I realized that the way I was shaving thenwould be the way I would shave for the rest of my life —because I had to keep the width the same.When I got back to his office,I wasn&#39;t really sure.I said, &quot;Can I see some evidence for this?&quot;So he showed me some picturesof little cheeks with little black dots —not very informative.I said, &quot;What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white?What would happen then?&quot;&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; he said.&quot;We have lasers; we can whiten it out.&quot;But I was still concerned,so I said, &quot;You know what, I&#39;m not going to do it.&quot;

zh-cn:接着 这成为了我生命中最大的罪恶感这个对于一个犹太教徒来说 意义重大啊（笑声）他说 &quot;丹，你怎么了?&quot;你喜欢这样不对称的样子?你有这种畸形的爱好?有女人感觉你很可怜用频繁的性爱来安慰你?所有这些都没有发生这点让我很惊讶因为我接受过很多治疗—也有很多我决定不接受的治疗—我从来没有这么后悔过但是我决定还是不接受这个治疗我找到他的助手问到 &quot;发生了什么?&quot;这种罪恶感从何而来他解释到 他们已经在两名患者上进行了治疗他们需要第三个患者 来完成他们的报告
en:And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life.This is coming from a Jewish guy, all right, so that means a lot.(Laughter)And he said, &quot;Dan, what&#39;s wrong with you?Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric?Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this?Do women feel pity for youand have sex with you more frequently?&quot;None of those happened.And this was very surprising to me,because I&#39;ve gone through many treatments —there were many treatments I decided not to do —and I never got this guilt trip to this extent.But I decided not to have this treatment.And I went to his deputy and asked him, &quot;What was going on?Where was this guilt trip coming from?&quot;And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already,and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing.

zh-cn:现在你可能觉得这个人是个白痴就是 他就是这样个人但是我来给大家一个不同的视角来看待相同的故事几年前 我在实验室里进行一系列我自己的实验当我们做实验的时候我们经常希望实验组会表现的和对照组截然不同所以我们对实验组的表现有着很高的期待对对照组的表现 我们的期望则会比较低当我们得到结果的时候 所得到的是—我是非常开心— 除了一个人之外团队中有个人本来表现应该很优秀的但是实际上却表现的很糟糕他拉下了总体的平均成绩毁了我试验中统计学的作用
en:Now you probably think that this guy&#39;s a schmuck.Right, that&#39;s what he seems like.But let me give you a different perspective on the same story.A few years ago, I was running some of my own experiments in the lab.And when we run experiments,we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another.So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high,another group that I thought their performance would be very low,and when I got the results, that&#39;s what we got —I was very happy — aside from one person.There was one person in the groupthat was supposed to have very high performancethat was actually performing terribly.And he pulled the whole mean down,destroying my statistical significance of the test.

zh-cn:我仔细的看这个人他比组内其他人都要大差不多20岁左右我还记得那个老迈的醉汉走进实验室的那天想赚些简单的钱就是那个人&quot;不会吧!&quot; 我想 &quot;把他给我扔出去谁同意这种醉鬼参加实验的?&quot;
en:So I looked carefully at this guy.He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample.And I remembered that the old and drunken guycame one day to the labwanting to make some easy cashand this was the guy.&quot;Fantastic!&quot; I thought. &quot;Let&#39;s throw him out.Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample?&quot;

zh-cn:但是几天后我和我学生考虑了这点我们说到 &quot;如果这醉汉不在组内的话 会发生什么?如果他去了另外一个组的话 会发生什么?那如果我们把他扔出去呢?&quot;我们甚至无法看到这类数据而且如果我们看到这类数据我们可能会说 &quot;怎么可能! 这么聪明的人怎么会表现的这么糟糕&quot;因为他把组里的平均分拉下一大截让我们统计的结果变的更加有根据所以我们决定不把这人排除出去 重新进行了实验
en:But a couple of days later,we thought about it with my students,and we said, &quot;What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition?What would have happened if he was in the other group?Would we have thrown him out then?&quot;We probably wouldn&#39;t have looked at the data at all,and if we did look at the data,we&#39;d probably have said, &quot;Fantastic! What a smart guy who is performing this low,&quot;because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower,giving us even stronger statistical results than we could.So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment.

zh-cn:但是 这些故事还有很多其他我们完成的实验有着利益冲突摆在我面前的主要是两方面第一点 我们一生中会遇见很多人用着各种方式来试着粉饰自己的面部他们刺激自己逃避现实展示给我们很多固有的偏见而且我确定有些事情我们都有所了解我们目睹它的发生或许我们不能每次都辨识但是我们知道它的确发生过
en:But you know, these stories,and lots of other experiments that we&#39;ve done on conflicts of interest,basically kind of bring two pointsto the foreground for me.The first one is that in life we encounter many peoplewho, in some way or another,try to tattoo our faces.They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to realityand give us advice that is inherently biased.And I&#39;m sure that it&#39;s something that we all recognize,and we see that it happens.Maybe we don&#39;t recognize it every time,but we understand that it happens.

zh-cn:当然 最困难的事 是去认清那些有时我们自己都被自己的定式所遮蔽这是个非常非常艰难的的课程因为我们无法看清自身的利益冲突当我在做实验的时候我觉得 我是在为科学做贡献我在处理数据让真实的数据模式得以闪现我不是在做坏事我觉得 我是像个骑士试着帮助科学前进但是事实却不是如此我实际上被很多正面的意识所左右我觉得真正的挑战是去认清那些我们生活中和我们有利益冲突的地方并试着不去相信自己的直觉来克服这个挑战试着做些事来防止自己陷入不自觉的行为中因为我们能处于一些不愉快的环境下
en:The most difficult thing, of course, is to recognizethat sometimes we tooare blinded by our own incentives.And that&#39;s a much, much more difficult lesson to take into account.Because we don&#39;t see how conflicts of interest work on us.When I was doing these experiments,in my mind, I was helping science.I was eliminating the datato get the true pattern of the data to shine through.I wasn&#39;t doing something bad.In my mind, I was actually a knighttrying to help science move along.But this was not the case.I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions.And I think the real challenge is to figure outwhere are the cases in our liveswhere conflicts of interest work on us,and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it,but to try to do thingsthat prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors,because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances.

zh-cn:我真的想留给大家一个正面的想法我指 这的确很压抑 是的—人们有利益冲突 我们看不见 摸不着这些积极的观点 我觉得是一种 如果我们清楚我们做错了如果我们了解到我们失败的原因和位置的根本原因我们就能真正的弥补这些而且 我想 这就是希望之所在 谢谢大家
en:I do want to leave you with one positive thought.I mean, this is all very depressing, right —people have conflicts of interest, we don&#39;t see it, and so on.The positive perspective, I think, of all of thisis that, if we do understand when we go wrong,if we understand the deep mechanismsof why we fail and where we fail,we can actually hope to fix things.And that, I think, is the hope. Thank you very much.
