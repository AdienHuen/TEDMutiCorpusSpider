zh-cn:大约两年前我在德国开车的时候打开了收音机当时的欧洲正处于欧债危机当中所有报纸上的头版头条都是欧洲国家被美国评级机构降级的消息我边听边想这些评级机构是做什么的为什么大家都因为他们的工作感到沮丧
en:Almost two years ago,I was driving in my car in Germany,and I turned on the radio.Europe at the time was in the middleof the Euro crisis,and all the headlines were about European countriesgetting downgraded by rating agenciesin the United States.I listened and thought to myself,&quot;What are these rating agencies,and why is everybody so upset about their work?&quot;

zh-cn:其实如果当时你坐在我车里的副驾上你肯定会告诉我我将在未来几年中致力于评级机构的改革当然 我会说那是疯狂的想法但你猜真正疯狂的是什么这些评级机构的运作模式我今天要和你们探讨的不仅是为什么我们要在现在进行改革还要讨论怎样进行改革
en:Well, if you were sittingnext to me in the car that dayand would have told me that I would devotethe next years to trying to reform them,obviously I would have called you crazy.But guess what&#39;s really crazy:the way these rating agencies are run.And I would like to explain to younot only why it&#39;s time to change this,but also how we can do it.

zh-cn:先来说说评级机构到底都做什么你一般会先看看汽车杂志再去买新车或者是先浏览产品评价再决定到底买哪种平板电脑或手机投资者们则是先看评级再决定把钱投向哪种产品评级范围包括从最顶尖的AAA到最差的垫底级别也就是BBB-也就是说这是一项非常冒险的投资评级机构的评级对象包括公司、银行甚至是金融产品比如说名声不怎么好的按揭证券但评级对象还包括国家这种评级叫做主权信用评级今天我就想主要讲一讲这些主权信用评级
en:So let me tell you a little bitabout what rating agencies really do.As you would read a car magazinebefore purchasing a new caror taking a look at a product reviewbefore deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get,investors are reading ratingsbefore they decide in which kind of productthey are investing their money.A rating can range from a so-called AAA,which means it&#39;s a top-performing product,and it can go down to the levelof the so-called BBB-,which means it&#39;s a fairly risky investment.Rating agencies are rating companies.They are rating banks.They are rating even financial productslike the infamous mortgage-backed securities.But they can also rate countries,and these ratings are called sovereign ratings,and I would like to focus in particularon these sovereign ratings.

zh-cn:我敢说，在座的各位听众肯定有人在想主权信用评级关我什么事？肯定有人在这么想其实 主权信用评级对你有影响对我们所有人都有影响一家评级机构对国家进行评级主要是评判一个国家的债务状况及其履行偿债责任的信用意愿与信用能力所以如果某国主权信用评级下降那么这个国家在国际市场借债则需支出更多成本所以作为公民和纳税人的你当然受到影响因为你和你的同胞们不得不付出更高昂的贷款利息支出但如果一个国家负担不起太过高昂的借贷成本怎么办那么这个国家只能削减服务比如道路、学校、医疗所以你必须要关注这个问题因为主权信用评级影响每一个人这正因如此，我认为应将其定义为公共财产透明的、可获取的免费面向所有人
en:And I can tell, as you&#39;re listening to me right now,you&#39;re thinking,so why should I really care about this, right?Be honest.Well, ratings affect you.They affect all of us.If a rating agency rates a country,it basically assesses and evaluatesa country&#39;s debtand the ability and willingness of a countryto repay its debt.So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency,the country has to pay morein order to borrow moneyon the international markets.So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer,because you and your fellow countrymenhave to pony up more in order to borrow.But what if a country can&#39;t afford to pay morebecause it&#39;s maybe too expensive?Well, then the country has less availablefor other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.And this is the reason why you should care,because sovereign ratings affect everyone.And that is the reason why I believethey should be defined as public goods.They should be transparent, accessible,and available to everyone at no cost.

zh-cn:但现在的情况是评级机构市场被三家机构垄断标普、穆迪和惠誉众所周知，当市场集中度走高就不会有竞争从而也就不会有诱因鼓励大家提高产品质量我们只能面对现实信用评级机构把全球经济推向边缘然而他们必须要改变其运作方式
en:But here&#39;s the situation:the rating agency market is dominatedby three players and three players only —Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s, Moody&#39;s, and Fitch —and we know whenever thereis a market concentration,there is really no competition.There is no incentive to improvethe quality of your product.And let&#39;s face it, the credit rating agencies have contributed,putting the global economy on the brink,and yet they have to change the way they operate.

zh-cn:第二点我要说的是你买车的时候难道是经销商说了算吗明显不是。那是不负责任的做法但事实上现在就是这样评级行业每天都是如此这些评级机构的客户比如说国家 或公司他们付费从而获得评级很明显这其中存在利益冲突
en:The second point,would you really buy a carjust based on the advice of the dealer?Obviously not, right? That would be irresponsible.But that&#39;s actually what&#39;s going onin the rating agency sector every single day.The customers of these rating agencies,like countries or companies,they are paying for their own ratings,and obviously this is creatinga conflict of interest.
时间： 4:12
zh-cn:我要讲的第三点是评级机构并没有向我们展示他们评级的方法和过程但在如今这个年代你如果不清清楚楚列出其成分连一块糖都别想卖出去但就评级来讲经济中如此重要的一个元素我们并不知道其工作方法过程我们允许评级机构工作的不透明性我们现在需要改变
en:The third point is,the rating agencies are not really telling ushow they are coming up with their ratings,but in this day and age,you can&#39;t even sell a candy barwithout listing everything that&#39;s inside.But for ratings, a crucial element of our economy,we really do not knowwhat all the different ingredients are.We are allowing the rating agenciesto be intransparent about their work,and we need to change this.

zh-cn:毫无疑问，我认为评级领域需要彻底改革绝不仅仅是小打小闹是时候采取大动作了是时候进行改善升级了正因如此，贝塔斯曼基金会投入大量时间和精力探索如何对评级行业进行改革我们已经建立了一个全新模式一个非营利性的主权信用评级机构其缩写是INCRA
en:I think there is no doubt that the sectorneeds a complete overhaul,not just a trimming at the margins.I think it&#39;s time for a bold move.I think it&#39;s time to upgrade the system.And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundationhave invested a lot of time and effortthinking about an alternative for the sector.And we have developed the first modelfor a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk,and we call it by its acronym, INCRA.
时间： 5:15
zh-cn:INCRA 将会改变现行机制将非盈利性机构加入现有的组合INCRA 基于非盈利性模式会有持续不断的款项为其奠定基础这些款项将为其运营者们带来收入保证评级机构的运营管理同时还能够保证我们提供的评级公开可用但仅凭这些尚且无法实现大转变INCRA还将基于一个十分明确的管理结构避免利益冲突涵盖社会各界的利益攸关者INCRA 将不仅仅是欧洲的或者美国的评级机构它将切实成为全球性的机构尤其是考虑到新兴经济体他们将享有平等的利益、话语权和代表权
en:INCRA would make a differenceto the current systemby adding another nonprofit player to the mix.It would be based on a nonprofit modelthat would be based on a sustainable endowment.The endowment would create incomethat would allow us to run the operation,to run the rating agency,and it would also allow usto make our ratings publicly available.But this is not enough to make a difference, right?INCRA would also be based ona very, very clear governance structurethat would avoid any conflict of interest,and it would include many stakeholders from society.INCRA would not only be a Europeanor an American rating agency,it would be a truly international one,in which, in particular, the emerging economieswould have an equal interest, voice and representation.
时间： 6:12
zh-cn:INCRA 要实现的第二大转变是其主权信用风险评判将基于一系列更广泛的指标想想看如果我们进行主权信用评级我们基本上是要看一个国家的经济土壤其宏观经济的基本面但我们也必须考虑一个问题谁在培育这个国家的经济土壤是不是？事实上 一个国家有许多位园艺大师其中之一 便是政府所以我们又要考虑的问题是一个国家是如何管理？它又是如何运作的？正因如此，我们探索开发了我们所谓的前瞻性指标这些指标能够为你更好地解读一个国家的社会经济发展状况我希望你能认同的是，你需要了解政府是否愿意投资可再生能源和教育你需要了解政府是否有能力管理危机政府是否最终能够推行其承诺过的改革例如，如果现在INCRA 要对南非进行主权信用评级我们肯定会密切审视这个国家的青年失业问题全球最严重非其莫属如果一个国家35岁以下的人口当中超过70%处于失业状态显然会对经济产生巨大影响今天如此，将来更甚于是，穆迪标普和惠誉的同行会说我们也会考虑这个因素但你猜怎么着？我们并不知道他们到底会如何将之列入考虑因素
en:The second big difference that INCRA would make isthat would it base its sovereign risk assessmenton a broader set of indicators.Think about it that way.If we conduct a sovereign rating,we basically take a look atthe economic soil of a country,its macroeconomic fundamentals.But we also have to ask the question,who is cultivating the economic soilof a country, right?Well, a country has many gardeners,and one of them is the government,so we have to ask the question,how is a country governed?How is it managed?And this is the reason why we have developedwhat we call forward-looking indicators.These are indicators that give youa much better read aboutthe socioeconomic development of a country.I hope you would agree it&#39;s important for you to knowif your government is willing to invest in renewable energy and education.It&#39;s important for you to knowif the government of your countryis able to manage a crisis,if the government is finally able to implementthe reforms that it&#39;s promised.For example, if INCRA would rateSouth Africa right now,of course we would take a very, very close lookat the youth unemployment of the country,the highest in the world.If over 70 percent of a country&#39;s populationunder the age of 35 is unemployed,of course this has a huge impact on the economytoday and even more so in the future.Well, our friends at Moody&#39;s,Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s, and Fitch will tell uswe would take this into account as well.But guess what? We do not knowexactly how they will take this into account.
时间： 8:01
zh-cn:这也把我们引到了INCRA要实现的第三个重大转变INCRA不仅会公布其评级还会公布其各项指标以及评级方法
en:And this leads me to the third big differencethat INCRA would make.INCRA would not only release its ratingsbut it would also release its indicatorsand methodology.
时间： 8:13
zh-cn:因此，与现行制度形成鲜明对比INCRA 将是完全透明的总而言之INCRA 将提供除现有的三大评级机构主宰局势的另一种选择通过引入全新非盈利性机构的方式这将增加竞争提高评级领域透明度还会提高评级工作的质量
en:So in contrast to the current system,INCRA would be fully transparent.So in a nutshell,INCRA would offer an alternativeto the current system ofthe big three rating agenciesby adding a new, nonprofit player to the mixthat would increase the competition,it would increase the transparency of the sector,and it would also increase the quality.

zh-cn:主权信用评级在你看来可能还是复杂的世界金融系统中一个小小的组成部分但我敢跟你保证这一改革尤为重要因为主权信用评级影响着所有人应当将其作为公共财产对待和处理所以 现在我们正在试行这一全新模式我们也在试图探索是否可以召集一组人马怀揣共同目标，胜任这一工作给 INCRA 注入活力我坚信 INCRA 的成立符合每个人的利益现在我们享有绝佳时机将 INCRA 打造成为基石奠定一个全新的，更具包容性的金融体系因为太久以来我们对金融巨头的行为不闻不问是时候参与进来了
en:I can tell that sovereign ratingsmay still look to you like this very small pieceof this very complex global financial world,but I tell you it&#39;s a very important one,and a very important one to fix,because sovereign ratings affect all of us,and they should be addressed and should be definedas public goods.And this is why we are testing our model right now,and why we are trying to find out if it canbring together a group of able and willing actorsto bring INCRA to life.I truly believe building up INCRAis in everyone&#39;s interest,and that we have the unique opportunity right nowto turn INCRA into a cornerstoneof a new, more inclusive financial system.Because for way too long,we have left the big financial players on their own.It&#39;s time to give them some company.
