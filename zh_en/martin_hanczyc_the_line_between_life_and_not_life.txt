zh-cn:有史以来人们所认识的生命体和非生命体之间是有巨大差异的比如说这个美丽而复杂的晶体和这个可爱而复杂的小猫之间的差异在过去约一百五十年间科学发现对生命和非生命的界线逐渐模糊现在我们认为二者之间存在连续性物质举个例子：病毒是个自然系统，是吧？但它非常简单它并不满足生命的所有条件它不具备一个生命系统的所有特征，而是一个寄生于另一生命体来繁殖和进化
en:So historically there hasbeen a huge divide between what peopleconsider to be non-living systems on oneside, and living systems on the other side.So we go from, say, this beautiful andcomplex crystal as non-life, and this ratherbeautiful and complex cat on the other side.Over the last hundred and fifty years or so,science has kind of blurred this distinctionbetween non-living and living systems, andnow we consider that there may be a kindof continuum that exists between the two.We&#39;ll just take one example here:a virus is a natural system, right?But it&#39;s very simple. It&#39;s very simplistic.It doesn&#39;t really satisfy all the requirements,it doesn&#39;t have all the characteristicsof living systems and is in fact a parasiteon other living systems in order to, say,reproduce and evolve.

zh-cn:但是今晚我将谈到的是更接近非生命这一端的实验通过实验室内的化学实验将非生命的物质混合创造出新结构这些新结构就很可能具有生命的一些特征我要说的就是创造人造生命
en:But what we&#39;re going to be talking about heretonight are experiments done on this sort ofnon-living end of this spectrum — so actuallydoing chemical experiments in the laboratory,mixing together nonliving ingredientsto make new structures, and that thesenew structures might have some of thecharacteristics of living systems.Really what I&#39;m talking about here istrying to create a kind of artificial life.

zh-cn:那这些特征都是什么？我们来看首先是具备形体这是将自身与环境区别开的必要条件生命同时会新陈代谢这是生命将从环境中获得的资源转化为维持和发展自身的基本构件的一个过程生命还要遗传信息比如人类将信息储存于基因中的DNA将其遗传给后代二者结合－形体和新陈代谢－就能得到一个可以运动和复制的系统如果结合信息遗传这个系统就更像生命也许可以进化这些就是我们在实验室的研究通过一些实验来创造这其中一个或更多的生命特征
en:So what are these characteristics that I&#39;mtalking about? These are them.We consider first that life has a body.Now this is necessary to distinguish the selffrom the environment.Life also has a metabolism. Now this is aprocess by which life can convert resourcesfrom the environment into building blocksso it can maintain and build itself.Life also has a kind of inheritable information.Now we, as humans, we store our informationas DNA in our genomes and we pass thisinformation on to our offspring.If we couple the first two — the body and the metabolism —we can come up with a system that couldperhaps move and replicate, and if wecoupled these now to inheritable information,we can come up with a system that would bemore lifelike, and would perhaps evolve.And so these are the things we will try to doin the lab, make some experiments that haveone or more of these characteristics of life.

zh-cn:我们是怎么做的呢？我们首先用一个模型系统来定义原始细胞你也许觉得这会是种原始形态的细胞它是一个活细胞的简单化学模型比如说你体内的一个细胞由成千上万个不同的分子组成起来成为一个复杂系统来生成我们赖以生存的东西我们在实验室里进行的实验基本就是此类工作但只有几十个不同的分子－复杂度大大降低但是仍然能产生类似生命的物质我们开始的工作很简单然后一步一步向生命体迈进试想一下勒杜克在一百年前说的话是关于合成生物学的“合成生命一旦出现将不会像我们以为的那样耸人听闻”这是第一如果我们真的在实验室创造出生命可能对我们的生活没有任何影响
en:So how do we do this? Well, we usea model system that we term a protocell.You might think of this as kind of like aprimitive cell. It is a simple chemicalmodel of a living cell, and if you considerfor example a cell in your body may haveon the order of millions of different typesof molecules that need to come together,play together in a complex networkto produce something that we call alive.In the laboratory what we want to dois much the same, but with on the order oftens of different types of molecules —so a drastic reduction in complexity, but stilltrying to produce something that looks lifelike.And so what we do is, we start simpleand we work our way up to living systems.Consider for a moment this quote byLeduc, a hundred years ago, considering akind of synthetic biology:&quot;The synthesis of life, should it ever occur,will not be the sensational discovery which weusually associate with the idea.&quot;That&#39;s his first statement. So if we actuallycreate life in the laboratories, it&#39;sprobably not going to impact our lives at all.

zh-cn:“如果我们认可进化论那么合成生命的出现必然不外乎无机和有机世界之间产生的形态或者是非生命和生命世界之间的只具备基本生命要素的物质形态”那么我刚刚提到的一点“其他的要素在环境的演化进程中慢慢加入”所以从简单入手 首先我创造了具备几个基本特征的结构然后将其发展至更接近生命的结构这就是我们创造原始细胞的方法我们应用的概念是自我集成意思就是在我实验室，我把几种化学物质放进试管这些化学物质通过自我联结形成越来越大的结构于是成千上万的分子经上万次联结聚集并形成之前不存在的更大结构在这个具体例子里我取了一些膜分子置于适宜的环境里混合几秒内就形成了复杂而美丽的结构这些膜无论是形态或结构都跟你体内的膜分子十分相似我们可以用它来形成原始细胞
en:&quot;If we accept the theory of evolution, thenthe first dawn of synthesis of life must consistin the production of forms intermediatebetween the inorganic and the organicworld, or between the non-livingand living world, forms which possessonly some of the rudimentary attributes of life&quot;— so, the ones I just discussed —&quot;to which other attributes will be slowly addedin the course of development by theevolutionary actions of the environment.&quot;So we start simple, we make some structuresthat may have some of these characteristicsof life, and then we try to develop thatto become more lifelike.This is how we can start to make a protocell.We use this idea called self-assembly.What that means is, I can mix somechemicals together in a test tube in my lab,and these chemicals will start to self-associateto form larger and larger structures.So say on the order of tens of thousands,hundreds of thousands of molecules willcome together to form a large structurethat didn&#39;t exist before.And in this particular example,what I took is some membrane molecules,mixed those together in the right environment,and within seconds it forms these rathercomplex and beautiful structures here.These membranes are also quite similar,morphologically and functionally,to the membranes in your body,and we can use these, as they say,to form the body of our protocell.

zh-cn:类似的可以用在水和油上众所周知水油不容但是通过自我集成就可以形成油滴并用此来形成人造组织或者原始细胞一会儿你们就能看到了这只是形成一些形体一些结构那么生命系统的其他方面呢？这是我们的原始细胞的模型我们是从一种叫做蒙脱土的天然粘土着手这种粘土在环境中自然形成它形成一种具有化学活性的表面可以在其上进行新成代谢活动有种分子易于这种粘土结合比如 红的这部分 RNA跟DNA相似是一种信息分子它会跟粘土的表面结合这个结构就能够在其周围形成一种膜结构就在周围形成液体分子这是显微照片上绿色部分这样通过自我集成在实验室里混合物质就得到了一种能代谢的表面携带有信息分子存在于膜机体的内部
en:Likewise,we can work with oil and water systems.As you know, when you put oil and water together,they don&#39;t mix, but through self-assemblywe can get a nice oil droplet to form,and we can actually use this as a body forour artificial organism or for our protocell,as you will see later.So that&#39;s just forming some body stuff, right?Some architectures.What about the other aspects of living systems?So we came up with this protocell model herethat I&#39;m showing.We started with a natural occurring claycalled montmorillonite.This is natural from the environment, this clay.It forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.It could run a metabolism on it.Certain kind of molecules like to associatewith the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red— this is a relative of DNA,it&#39;s an informational molecule —it can come along and it starts to associatewith the surface of this clay.This structure, then, can organize theformation of a membrane boundary arounditself, so it can make a body ofliquid molecules around itself, and that&#39;sshown in green here on this micrograph.So just through self-assembly, mixing thingstogether in the lab, we can come up with, say,a metabolic surface with someinformational molecules attachedinside of this membrane body, right?

zh-cn:这样我们就越来越接近生命系统但是你看到这个原始细胞并不会以为它是真的活细胞它实际上没有生命形成以后并没有任何活动因此有什么缺失了有些部分缺少了这部分就是比如说有能量流入一个系统我们需要的是一个能采集能量从而维持自身的原始细胞就像生命系统一样于是我们采用了一个不同的模型这个比之前的更简单这个模型里只是个油滴但是其内的化学代谢能让这个原始细胞利用能量具有动态就像这里看到的把一个油滴加入系统这是一滩水这个原始细胞就开始在系统里运动油滴是通过自我集成形成的内部的化学代谢令其能利用能量让自己在环境中动起来
en:So we&#39;re on a road towards living systems.But if you saw this protocell, you would notconfuse this with something that was actually alive.It&#39;s actually quite lifeless. Once it forms,it doesn&#39;t really do anything.So, something is missing.Some things are missing.So some things that are missing is,for example, if you had a flow of energythrough a system, what we&#39;d wantis a protocell that can harvestsome of that energy in order to maintain itself,much like living systems do.So we came up with a different protocellmodel, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.In this protocell model, it&#39;s just an oil droplet,but a chemical metabolism insidethat allows this protocell to use energyto do something, to actually become dynamic,as we&#39;ll see here.You add the droplet to the system.It&#39;s a pool of water, and the protocellstarts moving itself around in the system.Okay? Oil droplet formsthrough self-assembly, has a chemicalmetabolism inside so it can use energy,and it uses that energy to move itselfaround in its environment.

zh-cn:正如我们所知运动对生命系统是很重要的它在运动着 探索着周围环境通过形成的这些化学波来改造环境这样它就像一个生命系统一样运动去维持自身我们将同一个运动的原始细胞放入另一个环境运动起来我对环境加入食物就是这个蓝色的我对环境加入食物原始细胞运动着 碰上了食物自身重组然后到达食物的中心并停留在那里这样这个系统里不仅具有机体，并且存在代谢能消耗能量并运动能感知周围环境并找到环境里的资源来维持自身
en:As we heard earlier, movement is veryimportant in these kinds of living systems.It is moving around, exploring its environment,and remodeling its environment, as you see,by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.So it&#39;s acting, in a sense, like a living systemtrying to preserve itself.We take this same moving protocell here,and we put it in another experiment,get it moving. Then I&#39;m goingto add some food to the system,and you&#39;ll see that in blue here, right?So I add some food source to the system.The protocell moves. It encounters the food.It reconfigures itself and actually thenis able to climb to the highest concentrationof food in that system and stop there.Alright? So not only do we have this systemthat has a body, it has a metabolism,it can use energy, it moves around.It can sense its local environmentand actually find resourcesin the environment to sustain itself.

zh-cn:但它没有大脑没有神经系统只是一堆化学物质具有类生命的有趣而复杂的行为如果我们算一下系统里的化学物质算上水有五种化学物质来做到这个我们把这些原始细胞放到一个单一环境里看看会怎样依据不同的环境左边的原始细胞四处运动并接触环境里的另一个结构另外一边的两个原始细胞他们围着对方转圈好像绕着对方跳着一种复杂的舞这样不仅是个体原始细胞有行为特征就是刚刚看到的在系统内的行为同时像生物体一样有群体行为现在你们都是原始细胞专家下面我们就用这些原始细胞来做个游戏我们创造了两种原始细胞A具有一种化学物质一旦激活这个原始细胞就开始四处跳动记住这些是原始物质所以跳动的原始细胞是很有趣的（笑声）
en:Now, this doesn&#39;t have a brain, it doesn&#39;t havea neural system. This is just a sack ofchemicals that is able to have this interestingand complex lifelike behavior.If we count the number of chemicalsin that system, actually, including the waterthat&#39;s in the dish, we have five chemicalsthat can do this.So then we put these protocells together in asingle experiment to see what they would do,and depending on the conditions, we havesome protocells on the left that aremoving around and it likes to touch the otherstructures in its environment.On the other hand we have two movingprotocells that like to circle each other,and they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other.Right? So not only do individual protocellshave behavior, what we&#39;ve interpreted asbehavior in this system, but we also havebasically population-level behaviorsimilar to what organisms have.So now that you&#39;re all experts on protocells,we&#39;re going to play a game with these protocells.We&#39;re going to make two different kinds.Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistryinside that, when activated, the protocellstarts to vibrate around, just dancing.So remember, these are primitive things,so dancing protocells, that&#39;s veryinteresting to us. (Laughter)

zh-cn:第二种原始细胞有不同的化学物质一旦激活这些细胞就聚集到一起然后形成一个大的细胞我们把这两种原始细胞放到一个系统里这是A群体这是B群体然后激活系统蓝色群体B它们聚集一起然后形成一个大的其他的则在周围跳动这样一直到系统的能量耗尽我将此实验重复了几次有一次发生了很有趣的现象我把这些原始细胞加入系统A原始细胞和B原始细胞结合形成了AB细胞这在之前都没发生过现在系统里有原始细胞AB了AB会转圈B会结合
en:The second protocell has a differentchemistry inside, and when activated,the protocells all come together and they fuseinto one big one. Right?And we just put these two togetherin the same system.So there&#39;s population A,there&#39;s population B, and thenwe activate the system,and protocell Bs, they&#39;re the blue ones,they all come together. They fuse togetherto form one big blob, and the other protocelljust dances around. And this just happensuntil all of the energy in the system isbasically used up, and then, game over.So then I repeated this experimenta bunch of times, and one timesomething very interesting happened.So, I added these protocells togetherto the system, and protocell A and protocell Bfused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.That didn&#39;t happen before. There it goes.There&#39;s a protocell AB now in this system.Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit,while protocell B does the fusing, okay?

zh-cn:接下来有趣的现象发生了看看这两个大的细胞这两个合成细胞，结合了就有了跳动的原始细胞和自我复制的活动 （笑声）仅仅是通过化学物质这一切发生的机制是一个有五种化学物质的简单系统当它们结合的时候形成新的形态相比之前的更复杂这样另一个类生命的行为就出现了这里是复制
en:But then something even more interesting happens.Watch when these two large protocells,the hybrid ones, fuse together.Now we have a dancing protocelland a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter)Just with blobs of chemicals, again.So the way this works is, you havea simple system of five chemicals here,a simple system here. When they hybridize,you then form something that&#39;s different thanbefore, it&#39;s more complex than before,and you get the emergence of another kind oflifelike behavior whichin this case is replication.

zh-cn:既然我们能创造有趣的原始细胞有趣的颜色和有趣的行为而且这不是很难 它们具备有趣的生命特征也许这样原始细胞能揭开地球生命起源的秘密也许这代表着简单易行的一步当初地球生命开始的那第一步当然早期地球肯定存在多种分子但是它们肯定不象是我实验室那些实验里的纯化合物他们可能是更复杂的混合物因为不受约制的化学反应会创造出多种生物结构就像是原始物的稀泥很难分类区别这一堆东西即使是用现代技术产生物就像左边这个焦油一样棕色的而纯化合物则是右边用于对照的这样
en:So since we can make some interestingprotocells that we like, interesting colors andinteresting behaviors, and they&#39;re very easyto make, and they have interesting lifelikeproperties, perhaps these protocells havesomething to tell us about the origin of lifeon the Earth. Perhaps these represent aneasily accessible step, one of the first stepsby which life got started on the early Earth.Certainly, there were molecules present onthe early Earth, but they wouldn&#39;t have beenthese pure compounds that we worked within the lab and I showed in these experiments.Rather, they&#39;d be a real complex mixture ofall kinds of stuff, becauseuncontrolled chemical reactions producea diverse mixture of organic compounds.Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay?And it&#39;s a pool that&#39;s too difficult to fullycharacterize, even by modern methods, andthe product looks brown, like this tar hereon the left. A pure compoundis shown on the right, for contrast.
时间：10:32
zh-cn:这就像你从厨房取一些纯糖放在煎锅里然后你点上火糖的化学键就断开形成棕色的焦糖如果不加控制继续下去就会继续破坏和形成新的化学键形成更复杂的分子化合物最后就是你煎锅里黑乎乎的东西很难洗掉这就是生命最初的样子要从45亿前地球上这样的混沌里产生生命挑战就是抛弃实验室里纯化合物而是从那原始物的稀泥里产生出类生命的原始细胞
en:So this is similar to what happens when youtake pure sugar crystals in your kitchen,you put them in a pan, and you apply energy.You turn up the heat, you start makingor breaking chemical bonds in the sugar,forming a brownish caramel, right?If you let that go unregulated, you&#39;llcontinue to make and break chemical bonds,forming an even more diverse mixture ofmolecules that then forms this kind of blacktarry stuff in your pan, right, that&#39;sdifficult to wash out. So that&#39;s whatthe origin of life would have looked like.You needed to get life out of this junk thatis present on the early Earth,four, 4.5 billion years ago.So the challenge then is,throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab,and try to make some protocells with lifelikeproperties from this kind of primordial ooze.

zh-cn:我们就能看到那些刚才见到的油滴的自我集成内部那些黑点就代表着黑焦油多样的 非常复杂的 有机黑焦油我们将其放到你刚刚看到那些实验之一观察出现的活动看起来非常有意思同时也显示出相互转圈相互跟随的行为特征就像我们刚刚看到的强调一下只是在原始物质的条件下不是纯化学物这些焦油原始细胞也能够在其环境里定位资源我从左边加入一些资源扩散到整个系统中你能看到它们很喜欢这个它们变的非常有活力能找到环境里的资源就像我们刚刚看到的但是这些是在模拟原始的情况下进行的非常乱糟糟的环境而不是无菌的实验室环境就事实来说他们是很脏的小小的原始细胞但是重要的是他们具备生命特征
en:So we&#39;re able to then see the self-assemblyof these oil droplet bodies againthat we&#39;ve seen previously,and the black spots inside of thererepresent this kind of black tar — this diverse,very complex, organic black tar.And we put them into one of theseexperiments, as you&#39;ve seen earlier, and thenwe watch lively movement that comes out.They look really good, very nice movement,and also they appear to have some kind ofbehavior where they kind of circlearound each other and follow each other,similar to what we&#39;ve seen before — but again,working with just primordial conditions,no pure chemicals.These are also, these tar-fueled protocells,are also able to locate resourcesin their environment.I&#39;m going to add some resource from the left,here, that defuses into the system,and you can see, they really like that.They become very energetic, and ableto find the resource in the environment,similar to what we saw before.But again, these are done in these primordialconditions, really messy conditions,not sort of sterile laboratory conditions.These are very dirty little protocells,as a matter of fact. (Laughter)But they have lifelike properties, is the point.

zh-cn:这些人造生命实验帮助我们找到生命和非生命间的潜在路径不仅如此这也扩展了我们对生命和生命形式的认识生命也许会和地球上的生命形式大不相同这让我想起另外一个词“古怪的生命”这是史蒂芬･本纳的提法美国国家研究委员会在2007年的报告中引用了这个说法这个报告旨在研究如何在宇宙中发现其他生命特别是和地球上的生命不一样的生命形式如果我们去另一个星球如果那儿有生命的话我们怎么才知道那是生命呢？
en:So, doing these artificial life experimentshelps us define a potential path betweennon-living and living systems.And not only that, but it helps usbroaden our view of what life isand what possible life there could beout there — life that could be very differentfrom life that we find here on Earth.And that leads me to the nextterm, which is &quot;weird life.&quot;This is a term by Steve Benner.This is used in reference to a reportin 2007 by the National Research Councilin the United States, whereinthey tried to understand how we canlook for life elsewhere in the universe, okay,especially if that life is very different from lifeon Earth. If we went to another planet andwe thought there might be life there,how could we even recognize it as life?
时间：13:02
zh-cn:他们得出了三个基本标准都列在这儿了第一是 系统不能是平衡的这意味着系统首先不能是死的也就是要有能量输入系统从而生命可以利用并维持自身这就像太阳照着地球促进光合作用和生态系统没有太阳就没有生命第二 生命应该是液体形式因为就算存在有趣的结构或者分子但如果他们完全是固体形态那就不是适合生命的地方第三 要能够断开和结合化学键这很重要因为生命要能够将环境中的资源转化为维持自身的基本单元
en:Well, they came up with three very generalcriteria. First is — and they&#39;re listed here.The first is, the system has to be innon-equilibrium. That means the systemcannot be dead, in a matter of fact.Basically what that means is, you havean input of energy into the system that lifecan use and exploit to maintain itself.This is similar to having the Sun shiningon the Earth, driving photosynthesis,driving the ecosystem.Without the Sun, there&#39;s likely to beno life on this planet.Secondly, life needs to be in liquid form,so that means even if we had someinteresting structures, interesting moleculestogether but they were frozen solid,then this is not a good place for life.And thirdly, we need to be able to makeand break chemical bonds. And againthis is important because life transformsresources from the environment intobuilding blocks so it can maintain itself.

en:Now today, I told you about very strangeand weird protocells — some that contain clay,some that have primordial ooze in them,some that have basically oilinstead of water inside of them.Most of these don&#39;t contain DNA,but yet they have lifelike properties.But these protocells satisfythese general requirements of living systems.So by making these chemical, artificiallife experiments, we hope not onlyto understand something fundamentalabout the origin of life and the existenceof life on this planet, but alsowhat possible life there could beout there in the universe. Thank you.(Applause)
