zh-cn:每个女性朋友圈里都有一个搞笑的人当你需要大哭一场时你可以去找她当你遭遇不顺时她会告诉你忍忍就过了而以下这个朋友圈也一样除了这是一群卓越的女子她们聚在一起——先成为队友，然后朋友，最后家人——在最不可能发生这一切的地方：在特种部队的战场上这群女子她们友谊和英勇的凝结不单是靠她们在枪林弹雨中奋斗来的还因为这么一个事实事实就是那时候女人在官方上是不能参加地面作战的美国对她们的存在并不知情
en:Every group of female friendshas the funny one,the one you go towhen you need a good cry,the one who tells you to suck it upwhen you&#39;ve had a hard day.And this group was no different.Except that this was a communityof groundbreaking womenwho came together —first to become teammates,then friends, and then family —in the least likely of places:on the Special Operations battlefield.This was a group of womenwhose friendship and valor was cementednot only by what they had seenand done at the tip of the spear,but by the fact that they were thereat a time when women —officially, at least —remained banned from ground combat,and America had no idea they existed.

zh-cn:故事是从特种部队的队长开始的一些经受过考验的美国男士兵说“我们需要女人来帮我们发动战争。”“美国绝不会让战争结束的。”是这样说的“需要更多的认识和理解。”
en:This story beginswith Special Operations leaders,some of the most tested menin the United States military, saying,&quot;We need women to help us wage this war.&quot;&quot;America would never kill its wayto the end of its wars,&quot; it argued.&quot;Needed more knowledgeand more understanding.&quot;

zh-cn:每个人都知道如果你想知道一个社区或一个家庭里发生了什么你得找女人聊天不管你是聊阿富汗南部还是加州南部但在这种情况下，男人不能和女人聊天因为在一个保守的传统的社会，像阿富汗会被视为大不敬所以你需要女兵到那里去也就是说，在此时的战争中，那些被陆军游骑兵和海军海豹突击队招募去的女士们会看到不到百分之五的美国士兵所经历的那种战斗不到百分之五
en:And as everyone knows,if you want to understand what&#39;s happeningin a community and in a home,you talk to women,whether you&#39;re talking aboutSouthern Afghanistan,or Southern California.But in this case,men could not talk to women,because in a conservativeand traditional society like Afghanistan,that would cause grave offense.So you needed women soldiers out there.That meant, at this time in the war,that the women who would be recruitedto serve alongside Army Rangersand Navy SEALs,would be seeing the kind of combatexperienced by less than five percentof the entire United States military.Less than five percent.

zh-cn:所以有这样的口号：“女兵们：改变历史加入特种部队在阿富汗的战场吧。”这是2011年的从阿拉巴马州到阿拉斯加州一群想要和精英中的精英并肩作战想要有所作为想为她们国家做贡献的女士们响应了号召对她们来说，这不是政治，而是真心服务
en:So the call went out.&quot;Female soldiers:Become a part of history.Join Special Operationson the battlefield in Afghanistan.&quot;This is in 2011.And from Alabama to Alaska,a group of women who had alwayswanted to do something that matteredalongside the best of the best,and to make a differencefor their country,answered that call to serve.And for them it was not about politics,it was about serving with purpose.

zh-cn:所以，她们来到北卡罗来纳州去争取留在队中的名额以到达特种部队的前线她们迅速安定下来，形成团队认识了素未谋面却志同道合的伙伴全是强壮威猛的女子壮志凌云，无可匹敌她们无需为自己感到抱歉相反，她们应该为此感到庆幸她们在那里意识到的是忽然间多了很多像自己一样的人其中一个说“就像你四周看看，然后意识到动物园里不只自己这么一只长颈鹿呀。”
en:And so, the women who cameto North Carolinato compete for a spot on these teamswhich would put womenon the Special Operations front lines,landed and foundvery quickly a community,the likes of which they had never seen.Full of women who were as fierceand as fit as they were,and as driven to make a difference.They didn&#39;t have to apologizefor who they were,and in fact, they could celebrate it.And what they found when they were therewas that all of a sudden,there were lots of people like them.As one of them said,&quot;It was like you lookedaround and realizedthere was morethan one giraffe at the zoo.&quot;

zh-cn:在这些精英中，有一个叫凯西的人她是一位年轻的后备军官训练军团学员也是姐妹会的一员她还副修女性研究课程技集一身特里斯坦，一位西点军校的田径明星她在跑步和行军时总不穿袜子鞋子的味道已经出卖了她（笑声）安珀，有点像小说里那个海蒂，总想去步兵团当她发现他们不招女兵时她决定去当情报员她在波斯尼亚服役不久后协助联邦调查员瓦解了宾夕法尼亚州的大毒枭然后这个是凯特她高中四年都是校橄榄球队的但其实她在第一年的时候就想退出她想去合唱团但当那些男孩子跟她说女孩子玩不了橄榄球时她决定留下来身先士卒为小学妹们树立榜样
en:Among this team of standouts was Cassie,a young woman who managed to bean ROTC cadet, a sorority sisterand a Women&#39;s Studies minor,all in one person.Tristan, a West Point track star,who always ran and road marchedwith no socks,and had shoes whose smell proved it.(Laughter)Amber, a Heidi look-alike, who hadalways wanted to be in the infantry,and when she found outthat women couldn&#39;t be,she decided to become an intel officer.She served in Bosnia,and later helped the FBIto bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania.And then there was Kate,who played high school footballall four years,and actually wanted to drop outafter the first,to go into the glee club,but when boys told herthat girls couldn&#39;t play football,she decided to stayfor all the little girlswho would come after her.

zh-cn:对她们来说，生理的东西决定了她们部分命运就像凯西曾说过“高尚的事物对女孩子来说遥不可及”但是，在这里就有一个机会和精英中的精英一起在紧要关头为她们的国家服务女性身份在这里并非劣势反倒成了优势
en:For them, biology had shapedpart of their destiny,and put, as Cassie once said,&quot;everything nobleout of reach for girls.&quot;And yet, here was a chanceto serve with the best of the beston a mission that matteredto their country,not despite the factthat they were female,but because of it.

zh-cn:这群女子，在很多方面，都和大多数女子一样她们也梳妆打扮事实上，她们会在洗手间聚在一起画画眼线和眼影但她们也穿防弹衣她们会在背上放置50磅（约45斤）的负重登上直升机执行任务然后会回来看一部叫《伴娘我最大》的电影（笑声）她们甚至还穿着“斯班克斯”（弹性塑身内衣品牌）因为，她们很快发现那些为男士定做的制服该小的时候却过于宽松该宽松时却显窄小所以蕾恩，一名伊拉克战争老兵——我左边的那位——决定去亚马逊购物平台买一副弹性塑身内衣来打底让自己在晚上执勤时裤子感觉更舒适
en:This team of women, in many ways,was like women everywhere.They wore makeup, and in fact,they would bond in the ladies&#39; roomover eyeliner and eye pencil.They also wore body armor.They would put 50 poundsof weight on their backs,and board the helicopter for an operation,and they would come back and watcha movie called &quot;Bridesmaids.&quot;(Laughter)They even wore a thing called Spanx,because, as they found very quickly,the uniforms made for men werebig where they should be small,and small where they should be big.So Lane, an Iraq War veteran —you see her here on my left —decided she was going to go on Amazonand order a pair of Spanx to her base,so that her pants would fit betterwhen she went out on mission each night.

zh-cn:这些女士会一起开视频会议不管她们各自在阿富汗的哪个基地她们都会讨论成为女兵做着独一无二的事是怎样一种体验她们会互相讲笑话她们会谈及工作及工作之外的事聊聊她们取得哪些成就还有哪方面的不足她们也会聊作为女兵上阵特种部队前线一些轻松愉快的时候比如“嘘嘘斗”它能让你像个男人一样尿尿但据说精准度只有40%（笑声）
en:These women would get togetherover video conferencefrom all around Afghanistanfrom their various bases,and they would talk about what it was liketo be one of the only womendoing what they were doing.They would swap jokes,they would talk aboutwhat was working, what wasn&#39;t,what they had learned to do well,what they needed to do better.And they would talk aboutsome of the lighter moments of being womenout on the Special Operations front lines,including the Shewee,which was a toolthat let you pee like a guy,although it&#39;s said to have had onlya 40 percent accuracy rate out there.(Laughter)

en:These women lived in the &quot;and.&quot;They proved you could be fierceand you could be feminine.You could wear mascara and body armor.You could love CrossFit,and really like cross-stitch.You could love to climb out of helicoptersand you could also love to bake cookies.Women live in the and every single day,and these women brought thatto this mission as well.On this life and death battlefieldthey never forgotthat being female may have brought themto the front lines,but being a soldier is what wouldprove themselves there.

en:That night and so many others,they went out to prove themselves,not only for one another,but for everybodywho would come after them.And also for the menalongside whom they served.We talk a lot about howbehind every great man is a good woman.And in this case,next to these women stood menwho wanted to see them succeed.The Army Ranger who trained themhad served 12 deployments.And when they told himthat he had to go train girls,he had no idea what to expect.But at the end of eight days with thesewomen in the summer of 2011,he told his fellow Ranger,&quot;We have just witnessed history.These may well beour own Tuskegee Airmen.&quot;(Applause)

Jane.She was someone who lovedto make dinner for her husband,her Kent State ROTC sweetheartwho pushed her to be her best,and to trust herself,and to test every limit she could.She also loved to put 50 pounds of weighton her back and run for miles,and she loved to be a soldier.She was somebody who had a bread makerin her office in Kandahar,and would bake a batch of raisin bread,and then go to the gymand bust out 25 or 30 pull-upsfrom a dead hang.She was the person who, if you neededan extra pair of bootsor a home-cooked dinner,would be on your speed dial.Because she never, ever would talk to youabout how good she was,but let her character speakthrough action.She was famous for taking the hard rightover the easy wrong.And she was also famousfor walking up to a 15-foot rope,climbing it using only her arms,and then shuffling away and apologizing,because she knew she was supposedto use both her arms and her legs,as the Rangers had trained them.(Laughter)
