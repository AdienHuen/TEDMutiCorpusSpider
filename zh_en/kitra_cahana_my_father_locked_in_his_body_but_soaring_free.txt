en:I know a man who soars above the city every night.In his dreams, he twirls and swirlswith his toes kissing the Earth.Everything has motion, he claims,even a body as paralyzed as his own.This man is my father.

en:Three years ago, when I found outthat my father had suffered a severe strokein his brain stem,I walked into his room in the ICUat the Montreal Neurological Instituteand found him lying deathly still,tethered to a breathing machine.Paralysis had closed over his body slowly,beginning in his toes, then legs,torso, fingers and arms.It made its way up his neck,cutting off his ability to breathe,and stopped just beneath the eyes.He never lost consciousness.Rather, he watched from withinas his body shut down,limb by limb,muscle by muscle.

zh-cn:身处险境是许多人的梦魇在法国，有时人们称之为炼狱噩梦字面上理解，即“在病痛中行走”对许多人来说，也许瘫痪是不可言说的恐怖但我父亲的经历失去了身体的各部位的功能却不为所困反而转向内观在外界扰攘中静下心面对自己的内心深处在那里爱上新的生命和躯体
en:Locked-in syndromeis many people&#39;s worst nightmare.In French, it&#39;s sometimes called&quot;maladie de l&#39;emmuré vivant.&quot;Literally, &quot;walled-in-alive disease.&quot;For many people, perhaps most,paralysis is an unspeakable horror,but my father&#39;s experiencelosing every system of his bodywas not an experience of feeling trapped,but rather of turning the psyche inwards,dimming down the external chatter,facing the recesses of his own mind,and in that place,falling in love with life and body anew.

zh-cn:作为一个拉比（犹太人的学者）和关注心灵的人游离于思想和身体，生命和死亡之间瘫痪为他开启了新的意识他意识到他不再需要观察逾越肉体世界才能追求圣神“天堂就在这个躯体里面就在这个世界” 他说
en:As a rabbi and spiritual mandangling between mind and body, life and death,the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him.He realized he no longer needed to lookbeyond the corporeal worldin order to find the divine.&quot;Paradise is in this body.It&#39;s in this world,&quot; he said.

zh-cn:起初四个月 我睡在父亲的床边尽我所能消除他的不适理解人类内心深处的恐惧因为无法求救我的母亲，兄弟姐妹们还有我我们围着他，形成医治他的蛹我们成为了他的说话筒每天花上几小时背诵字母表他耳语一些重心长的话还有诗歌，他的眼里闪着光芒父亲的房间化身我们医治的殿堂而他的床畔成了那些寻求帮助和心灵慰藉的场所。通过我们我的父亲可以说话升华心灵一字又一字一眨眼又一眨眼所有的一切变得缓慢并且温柔当医院病房的喧嚣，疯狂和死亡渐渐消失我想说给你们听的第一件事是在父亲中风后的第一个礼拜 我们听写下来的内容他写了一封信给教会的会众在结尾处他写到当我的项背炸开我进入了另一个次元初生，俯瞰尘世，细微一个个宇宙开启，关闭，生生不息很多人在生命的低谷停止生长上星期，我被打击到如此卑微但是我感觉到我父亲的手扶住了我我父亲把我带了回来
en:I slept by my father&#39;s side for the first four months,tending as much as I couldto his every discomfort,understanding the deep human psychological fearof not being able to call out for help.My mother, sisters, brother and I,we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing.We became his mouthpiece,spending hours each day reciting the alphabetas he whispered back sermonsand poetry with blinks of his eye.His room, it became our temple of healing.His bedside became a site for thoseseeking advice and spiritual counsel, and through us,my father was able to speakand uplift,letter by letter,blink by blink.Everything in our world became slow and tenderas the din, drama and death of the hospital wardfaded into the background.I want to read to you one of the first thingsthat we transcribed in the week following the stroke.He composed a letter,addressing his synagogue congregation,and ended it with the following lines:&quot;When my nape exploded,I entered another dimension:inchoate, sub-planetary, protozoan.Universes are opened and closed continually.There are many when low,who stop growing.Last week, I was brought so low,but I felt the hand of my father around me,and my father brought me back.&quot;

zh-cn:当我们不再是他的声音的时候我们成了他的双腿和双臂我移动手脚就像我知道自己的手脚想要舒展假想我若是整天动弹不得我握着他的手指贴在我的脸庞弯曲每个关节使它柔软和弹性我一遍又一遍的问他让他看到每一个动作从内部看手指弯曲伸直和随之移动跟着他的意念
en:When we weren&#39;t his voice,we were his legs and arms.I moved them like I know I would have wantedmy own arms and legs to be movedwere they still for all the hours of the day.I remember I&#39;d hold his fingers near my face,bending each joint to keep it soft and limber.I&#39;d ask him again and againto visualize the motion,to watch from within as the finger curledand extended, and to move along with itin his mind.

zh-cn:有一天，我用眼角的余光看到他的身体像蛇一样扭动一种无意识的痉挛通过他的手臂一开始，我想这是我自己的幻觉花费了太多时间照顾的身体如此渴望看到他身体某个部位自己能够有所回应但是他告诉我他感觉到刺痛感断断续续的电流就在他的肌肤Z之下在接下来的一周里，他出现了十分微弱的肌肉抗力刺激和反应开始产生连接身体慢慢地恢复知觉从双腿到双臂，从肌肉到肌肉抽搐一下接着一下
en:Then, one day, from the corner of my eye,I saw his body slither like a snake,an involuntary spasm passing through the courseof his limbs.At first, I thought it was my own hallucination,having spent so much time tending to this one body,so desperate to see anything react on its own.But he told me he felt tingles,sparks of electricity flickering on and offjust beneath the surface of the skin.The following week, he began ever so slightlyto show muscle resistance.Connections were being made.Body was slowly and gently reawakening,limb by limb, muscle by muscle,twitch by twitch.

zh-cn:作为一个纪实摄影师我感觉到记录下这一切的必要每一个他第一次的移动就像母亲和他的新生儿我拍下了他第一次无供养呼吸庆祝时刻 在出现第一次肌肉抗力后新的科技使得他获得越来越多的自主性我拍下了围绕在他身边的关怀和爱
en:As a documentary photographer,I felt the need to photographeach of his first movementslike a mother with her newborn.I photographed him taking his first unaided breath,the celebratory moment after he showedmuscle resistance for the very first time,the new adapted technologies that allowed himto gain more and more independence.I photographed the care and the lovethat surrounded him.

zh-cn:但是我的照片仅仅讲述了故事的表面一个男人躺在病床上依附着呼吸机我没能刻画他内心的故事我开始寻找一种新的可视化的语言一种努力表达瞬间的语言展现他的心灵历程
en:But my photographs only told the outside storyof a man lying in a hospital bedattached to a breathing machine.I wasn&#39;t able to portray his story from within,and so I began to search for a new visual language,one which strived to express the ephemeral qualityof his spiritual experience.

zh-cn:最后，我想和你们分享我一直在坚持的系列中的一段视频它试图表达了缓慢的滞留生死之间的过程我父亲经历过的当他开始重获呼吸的能力时我开始记录他的想法因此你们在这段视频中听到的声音是我父亲的声音
en:Finally, I want to share with youa video from a series that I&#39;ve been working onthat tries to express the slow, in-between existencethat my father has experienced.As he began to regain his ability to breathe,I started recording his thoughts,and so the voice that you hear in this videois his voice.

zh-cn:对于我们中的大多数我们的肌肉开始抽搐运动我们过很久才会意识到但是我的父亲告诉我他的奇异恩典是住在外围在人类经验的外围想宇航员欣赏到的景色我们中间很少有人将会看到他惊讶地注视着他第一次呼吸梦想着爬回家当他57时，他说一个蹒跚学步的孩子内心对他的生命没有想法但是一个成年人每天坚持着他想要的世界
en:Kitra Cahana: For most of us,our muscles begin to twitch and movelong before we are conscious,but my father tells me his privilegeis living on the far peripheryof the human experience.Like an astronaut who sees a perspectivethat very few of us will ever get to share,he wonders and watches as he takeshis first breathsand dreams about crawling back home.So begins life at 57, he says.A toddler has no attitude in its being,but a man insists on his world every day.

zh-cn:我们中间很少会要面临生理的限制达到像我父亲那样的程度但是我们都会遇到无力的时刻在我们的生命中我常常面对生活的围墙感到完全不可超越但是我的父亲坚持人生没有死胡同相反，他邀请我进入共同治疗的空间展现一个最完美的自己，对他而言在我面前展现一个最完美的他瘫痪为他打开了一扇窗这是一个涌现生命的机会重获生命的力量一个人长时间静静地坐着爱上创造的永恒
en:Few of us will ever have to face physical limitationsto the degree that my father has,but we will all have moments of paralysisin our lives.I know I frequently confront wallsthat feel completely unscalable,but my father insiststhat there are no dead ends.Instead, he invites me into his space of co-healingto give the very best of myself, and for himto give the very best of himself to me.Paralysis was an opening for him.It was an opportunity to emerge,to rekindle life force,to sit still long enough with himselfso as to fall in love with the full continuumof creation.

en:Today, my father is no longer locked in.He moves his neck with ease,has had his feeding peg removed,breathes with his own lungs,speaks slowly with his own quiet voice,and works every dayto gain more movement in his paralyzed body.But the work will never be finished.As he says, &quot;I&#39;m living in a broken world,and there is holy work to do.&quot;
