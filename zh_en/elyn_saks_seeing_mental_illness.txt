zh-cn:我是一个患有慢性精神分裂症的女人我曾经有几百天都待在精神病医院里面也许我有可能一生大部分时间都待在医院的病房里但是我的人生并没有这样事实上， 我成功的离开了医院将近三十年了这可能是我最自豪的成就了但是这并不代表我没有精神上的挣扎当我从耶鲁大学毕业以后我得到了第一份法律工作， 我在纽黑文的医生， 外特告诉我他将在三个月之后停止他的治疗工作。这发生在我准备离开纽黑文的几年前。外特对我有很大的帮助，想到他的离开几乎让我崩溃
en:So I&#39;m a woman with chronic schizophrenia.I&#39;ve spent hundreds of daysin psychiatric hospitals.I might have ended up spendingmost of my life on the back ward of a hospital,but that isn&#39;t how my life turned out.In fact, I&#39;ve managed to stay clear of hospitalsfor almost three decades,perhaps my proudest accomplishment.That&#39;s not to say that I&#39;ve remained clearof all psychiatric struggles.After I graduated from the Yale Law School andgot my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White,announced to me that he was going to close his practicein three months, several yearsbefore I had planned to leave New Haven.White had been enormously helpful to me,and the thought of his leavingshattered me.

zh-cn:我最好的朋友史蒂夫感觉到了有东西很不对飞到了纽黑文来和我待在一起现在我要读一段我自己的笔记了：我打开我一室一厅的房子史蒂夫后来告诉我即使他多次见过我病发的时候，也还是为他当天见到的我吃惊。我有一个星期没怎么吃东西了我很憔悴， 我走路的时候感觉自己的脚是木头做的我感觉自己的脸是一张面具我把所有的窗帘都关起来了正午的时候我的房间几乎是完全黑暗的空气难闻， 屋子凌乱史蒂夫， 作为一个律师和心理学家，治疗过很多有严重精神病的患者， 直到今天他会觉得这是他见过的最坏的情况了“你好”， 我说， 然后回到我沉静了一时的沙发上谢谢你的到来摇摇欲坠的世界，词， 声音告诉钟停下来时间， 时间来了“外特要离开了”， 史蒂夫说“我被推倒坟墓里了， 处境就是坟墓” 我呻吟到地心引力在把我往下拉我很害怕， 告诉他门离开“
en:My best friend Steve,sensing that something was terribly wrong,flew out to New Haven to be with me.Now I&#39;m going to quote from some of my writings:&quot;I opened the door to my studio apartment.Steve would later tell me that,for all the times he had seen me psychotic, nothingcould have prepared him for what he saw that day.For a week or more, I had barely eaten.I was gaunt. I walkedas though my legs were wooden.My face looked and felt like a mask.I had closed all the curtains in the apartment, soin the middle of the daythe apartment was in near total darkness.The air was fetid, the room a shambles.Steve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treatedmany patients with severe mental illness, and to this dayhe&#39;ll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen.&#39;Hi,&#39; I said, and then I returned to the couch,where I sat in silence for several moments.&#39;Thank you for coming, Steve.Crumbling world, word, voice.Tell the clocks to stop.Time is. Time has come.&#39;&#39;White is leaving,&#39; Steve said somberly.&#39;I&#39;m being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,&#39; I moan.&#39;Gravity is pulling me down.I&#39;m scared. Tell them to get away.&#39;&quot;

zh-cn:作为一个年轻女人， 我在精神病院里待过三段很长的时间。我的医生给我诊断了慢性精神分裂给了我一个”不乐观“的预测就是说， 我只能在看护下活着做很低下的工作但是很幸运的是， 我其实没有执行这个预测相反， 我是一个南加州大学Gould 法学院的首席法律教授，心理学教授，精神病学教授。我有很多亲近的朋友和亲爱的丈夫， 他今天也来了
en:As a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospitalon three different occasions for lengthy periods.My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia,and gave me a prognosis of &quot;grave.&quot;That is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care,and work at menial jobs.Fortunately, I did not actuallyenact that grave prognosis.Instead, I&#39;m a chaired Professor of Law, Psychologyand Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law,I have many close friendsand I have a beloved husband, Will, who&#39;s here with us today.

zh-cn:我想和你分享这是怎样发生的，而且向你描述我作为一个精神病患者我想说的是，这只是我的经历因为每个人的精神病多有不同的症状
en:I&#39;d like to share with you how that happened, and alsodescribe my experience of being psychotic.I hasten to add that it&#39;s my experience,because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.

zh-cn:让我们从精神分裂的定义开始把，精神分裂是一种大脑疾病它的主要症状是幻想， 或者是与现实脱离妄想和幻觉是这个病的标志妄想是顽固，错误和不会因为现实而改变的信仰幻觉是不存在的感觉比如， 当我病发的时候，我总是有我用我的想法杀了几百个人的错觉我有时候会觉得自己脑子里正要发生核爆炸也有时候， 我有幻觉有个人在我后面高举这一把刀想象以下在清醒的情况下做噩梦
en:Let&#39;s start with the definition of schizophrenia.Schizophrenia is a brain disease.Its defining feature is psychosis, or beingout of touch with reality.Delusions and hallucinationsare hallmarks of the illness.Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren&#39;t responsiveto evidence, and hallucinations are false sensory experiences.For example, when I&#39;m psychotic I often havethe delusion that I&#39;ve killed hundreds of thousandsof people with my thoughts.I sometimes have the idea thatnuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.Occasionally, I have hallucinations,like one time I turned around and saw a manwith a raised knife.Imagine having a nightmare while you&#39;re awake.

zh-cn:言语和思想经常变得没有头绪简直没有任何逻辑当人有散漫的联想的时候， 就会把一些很相似的词放在一起， 没有任何意义感觉像一个文字混在一起的“沙拉”和大部分人以为的恰好相反，精神分裂不是多重人格或 人格分裂精神分裂的大脑不是分开的， 是破碎的
en:Often, speech and thinking become disorganizedto the point of incoherence.Loose associations involves putting together wordsthat may sound a lot alike but don&#39;t make sense,and if the words get jumbled up enough, it&#39;s called &quot;word salad.&quot;Contrary to what many people think, schizophrenia is notthe same as multiple personality disorder or split personality.The schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered.

zh-cn:每个人都看到过街上有人不修边幅， 营养不良站在外面乱对自己说话或者大声嚷嚷这种人多半是有精神分裂但是精神分裂出现在很多不同的社会层次中。 其中有很多患者是有全职工作的，承担着很大责任的。几年前， 我决定把我的个人经历写下来而且我像和你分享更多我的个人经历以此给大家一个轻身经历的人的角度看待这个事情
en:Everyone has seen a street person,unkempt, probably ill-fed,standing outside of an office building mutteringto himself or shouting.This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia.But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide arrayof socioeconomic status, and there are peoplewith the illness who are full-time professionalswith major responsibilities.Several years ago, I decidedto write down my experiences and my personal journey,and I want to share some more of that story with you todayto convey the inside view.

zh-cn:接下载这件事发生在我上耶鲁大学法学院的第一学期的第七周从我的笔记中：”我的两个同学， Rebel和Val 和我约了一个时间星期五一起在图书馆学习我们的备忘录的作业但是我们没有完成， 因为我开始胡言乱语
en:So the following episode happened the seventh weekof my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School.Quoting from my writings:&quot;My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the dateto meet in the law school library on Friday nightto work on our memo assignment together.But we didn&#39;t get far before I was talking in waysthat made no sense.
时间： 4:47
zh-cn:“备忘录是探访”， 我告诉他们“他们有写观点， 观点就在你脑子里，Pat 曾经就这么说， 你杀了人吗？‘Rebel 和Val看着我，好像我在他们脸上泼了冷水一样“你在说什么？， Elyn？“”哦， 你知道的， 谁是什么， 什么是谁？，天堂和地狱，让我们去屋顶。那是平的， 那里安全。“Rebel和Val跟着我问我怎么了”这就是真正的我“ 我说高高的挥着我的手然后， 在星期五很晚的时候，在法学院的楼顶上我开始唱歌，很大声”来到佛罗里达 阳光和灌木你想跳舞吗？“”你嗑药了吗” 有人问， “你high了吗？”“咳？不可能， 没有嗑药。来到佛罗里达， 阳光灌木，那里有柠檬， 那里有恶魔“你吓倒我了”， 他们一个人说， Rebel和Val回到了图书馆。我耸耸肩， 跟着他们。
en:&#39;Memos are visitations,&#39; I informed them.&#39;They make certain points. The point is on your head.Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?&#39;Rebel and Val looked at meas if they or I had beensplashed in the face with cold water.&#39;What are you talking about, Elyn?&#39;&#39;Oh, you know, the usual. Who&#39;s what, what&#39;s who,heaven and hell. Let&#39;s go out on the roof.It&#39;s a flat surface. It&#39;s safe.&#39;Rebel and Val followedand they asked what had gotten into me.&#39;This is the real me,&#39; I announced,waving my arms above my head.And then, late on a Friday night, on the roofof the Yale Law School,I began to sing, and not quietly either.&#39;Come to the Florida sunshine bush.Do you want to dance?&#39;&#39;Are you on drugs?&#39; one asked. &#39;Are you high?&#39;&#39;High? Me? No way, no drugs.Come to the Florida sunshine bush,where there are lemons, where they make demons.&#39;&#39;You&#39;re frightening me,&#39; one of them said, and Rebel and Valheaded back into the library.I shrugged and followed them.

zh-cn:回来之后， 我告诉我的同学他们有没有同样的胡言乱语的经历像我一样“我觉得有人进入了我的案件” 我说“我们要把关节装起来，我不相信关节， 但是它们能把身体连起来。－－这就是一个散漫联想的例子最终我回到了宿舍到了后， 我没有办法安心。我脑子里都是噪音到处都是桔子树和我写不出来的法律备忘录以及那些我需要为之负责任的大规模谋杀。坐在床上， 我摇来摇去在孤独和恐惧中呻吟。”这次发病让我第一次在美国住院了，我前两次在英国
en:Back inside, I asked my classmates if they werehaving the same experience of words jumping aroundour cases as I was.&#39;I think someone&#39;s infiltrated my copies of the cases,&#39; I said.&#39;We&#39;ve got to case the joint.I don&#39;t believe in joints, butthey do hold your body together.&#39;&quot; —It&#39;s an example of loose associations. —&quot;Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room,and once there, I couldn&#39;t settle down.My head was too full of noise,too full of orange trees and law memos I could not writeand mass murders I knew I would be responsible for.Sitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth,moaning in fear and isolation.&quot;This episode led to my first hospitalization in America.I had two earlier in England.

zh-cn:继续我的笔记：“第二天， 我来到我教授办公室， 问我能不能晚点交作业，然后喔喔喔欧开始胡言乱语，就像前一天晚上一样他最后把我送到急诊室到了之后，有一个人， 我就叫他“医生”吧，和他的野蛮助手们，飞扑下来把我举的高高的然后狠狠的摔在了一张金属床上重的我都看到星星了然后它们把我的手脚都帮起来了用很厚的皮带一个我丛没有听到过的声音丛我嘴里说出来：一半呻吟， 一半尖叫惨无人性，纯粹恐惧然后这个声音又出现了从我的肚子了逼出来的刮着我的喉咙这个事情导致了我被强制住院其中一个理由我医生给的强制住院的理由是我严重生活不自理为了支持这个说法， 它们在我的档案里写说我不能完成我耶鲁法学院的作业。我不知道这对其他的纽黑文的人意味着什么（笑声）
en:Continuing with the writings:&quot;The next morning I went to my professor&#39;s office to askfor an extension on the memo assignment,and I began gibbering unintelligablyas I had the night before,and he eventually brought me to the emergency room.Once there, someone I&#39;ll just call &#39;The Doctor&#39;and his whole team of goons swooped down,lifted me high into the air,and slammed me down on a metal bedwith such force that I saw stars.Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bedwith thick leather straps.A sound came out of my mouth that I&#39;d never heard before:half groan, half scream,barely human and pure terror.Then the sound came again,forced from somewhere deep inside my bellyand scraping my throat raw.&quot;This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing meagainst my will was that I was&quot;gravely disabled.&quot;To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unableto do my Yale Law School homework.I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.(Laughter)

zh-cn:在第二年， 我又在医院里待了五个月有时候， 我会再机械限制中度过20小时，手被捆这， 手和脚被紧紧的捆着手和脚被捆着， 而且胸前还有一个网子绑着我没有打任何人我没有害任何人， 我没有直接威胁任何人如果你没有被限制过， 你可能对这个经历有个不差的印象但是其实糟透了
en:During the next year, I wouldspend five months in a psychiatric hospital.At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints,arms tied, arms and legs tied down,arms and legs tied down with a net tiedtightly across my chest.I never struck anyone.I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.If you&#39;ve never been restrained yourself, you may havea benign image of the experience.There&#39;s nothing benign about it.
时间： 7:54
zh-cn:再美国， 每周都有一到三个人死于这种限制他们被缧， 吸着自己的呕吐物他们被窒息， 他们心脏病发作不知道这种机械限制是在救人还是害人当我在耶鲁法学院刊物上给学生准备关于机械限制的讲义时，我咨询了一位知名的法学教授和精神病学家并向他肯定了这种限制时伤人自尊，痛苦和可怕的他理解的看着我， 说“Elyn， 你还是不明白：这些人又精神病。他们和你和我都不一样他们不会像你我一样经历限制。我当时没有勇气告诉他不， 我们和你并没有什么不同我们不喜欢被捆绑在床上跟他一样不喜欢在那里受苦事实上， 最近我肯定现在还是有人觉得这些限制能帮助病人感到安全我从来没有遇到过一个精神病同意这种说法今天， 我非常赞成心理治疗但是非常反对强制型治疗我觉得强迫没有效果， 而且对一个有严重精神病的人实施强制手段是很可怕的
en:Every week in the United States,it&#39;s been estimated that one to three people die in restraints.They strangle, they aspirate their vomit,they suffocate, they have a heart attack.It&#39;s unclear whether using mechanical restraintsis actually saving lives or costing lives.While I was preparing to write my student notefor the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints,I consulted an eminent law professor who was alsoa psychiatrist,and said surely he would agreethat restraints must be degrading,painful and frightening.He looked at me in a knowing way, and said,&quot;Elyn, you don&#39;t really understand:These people are psychotic.They&#39;re different from me and you.They wouldn&#39;t experience restraints as we would.&quot;I didn&#39;t have the courage to tell him in that moment that,no, we&#39;re not that different from him.We don&#39;t like to be strapped down to a bedand left to suffer for hours any more than he would.In fact, until very recently,and I&#39;m sure some people still hold it as a view,that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.I&#39;ve never met a psychiatric patientwho agreed with that view.Today, I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m very pro-psychiatrybut very anti-force.I don&#39;t think force is effective as treatment, and I thinkusing force is a terrible thing to do to another personwith a terrible illness.

zh-cn:最终， 我来到了洛杉矶在南加州法学院教书这些年来， 我一直反对用药为此会付出一切。我感觉到我不服用药物也可以保持我想要证明毕竟我精神上没问题,只不过是诊断上犯得错误而已我的理念是服药越少,瑕疵就越少我的分析师 Kaplan博士,当时劝我坚持服药并且就这样生活下午但是我决定我想要最最后一次尝试从文中引用:&quot;我开始减少我的用药量,而在短时间之内我就感觉到了一些变化在从牛津旅行回来后,我冲进了Kaplan的办公室,冲向角落,蹲了下来捂住我的脸,开始颤抖在我周围我感觉到了拿了匕首的恶魔他们把我切成了碎片或者让我吞下滚烫的煤球Kaplan后来把我当时情景描述为&quot;在撕心裂肺的痛苦中蠕动&quot;即使在这个状态下,他准确地描述为急性神经病我拒绝服用更多的药物因为任务还没有完成
en:Eventually, I came to Los Angelesto teach at the University of Southern California Law School.For years, I had resisted medication,making many, many efforts to get off.I felt that if I could manage without medication,I could prove that, after all,I wasn&#39;t really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.My motto was the less medicine, the less defective.My L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging mejust to stay on medication and get on with my life,but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off.Quoting from the text:&quot;I started the reduction of my meds, and within a short timeI began feeling the effects.After returning from a trip to Oxford, I marched intoKaplan&#39;s office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down,covered my face, and began shaking.All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.They&#39;d slice me up in thin slicesor make me swallow hot coals.Kaplan would later describe me as &#39;writhing in agony.&#39;Even in this state, what he accurately described asacutely and forwardly psychotic,I refused to take more medication.The mission is not yet complete.
时间：10:09
zh-cn:在与Kaplan的面会结束后,我去看了Marder医生,一位精神分裂症专家他是负责观察我用药的副作用的他觉得我可能有一定程度上的精神分裂一次在他的办公室,我坐在沙发上,蜷缩起来,然后开始喃喃自语&quot;头破血流,人们试图杀戮,我能不能把你的办公室彻底当垃圾处理?&quot;&quot;如果你那么想的话,你需要现在离开.&quot;Marder说&quot;好吧.小一点.在冰上的火.告诉他们不要杀我.告诉他们不要杀我.我做错什么了?成百上千个想法被封锁&quot;Elyn,你是不是觉得你对自己或他人很危险?我认为你应该待在医院里我可以现在就让你被容纳进来,整个事情会变得十分分散.&quot;&quot;哈哈哈,你想把我放在医院里?医院是不好的,它们都疯了,它们都十分难过任何一个人都得远离医院.我就是上帝,或者我以前是.&quot;在那个情况下,当我说&quot;我是上帝,或者我以前是&quot;的时候,我的丈夫在边上记了一笔他问:&quot;那你是退出了还是被开除了?&quot;(笑声)&quot;我创造生命然后我拿走他们,原谅我吧,因为我不知道该做什么.&quot;
en:Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan,I went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expertwho was following me for medication side effects.He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.Once in his office, I sat on his couch, folded over,and began muttering.&#39;Head explosions and people trying to kill.Is it okay if I totally trash your office?&#39;&#39;You need to leave if you think you&#39;re going to do that,&#39;said Marder.&#39;Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me.Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong?Hundreds of thousands with thoughts, interdiction.&#39;&#39;Elyn, do you feel like you&#39;redangerous to yourself or others?I think you need to be in the hospital.I could get you admitted right away, and the whole thingcould be very discrete.&#39;&#39;Ha, ha, ha.You&#39;re offering to put me in hospitals?Hospitals are bad, they&#39;re mad, they&#39;re sad.One must stay away. I&#39;m God, or I used to be.&#39;&quot;At that point in the text,where I said &quot;I&#39;m God, or I used to be,&quot; my husbandmade a marginal note.He said, &quot;Did you quit or were you fired?&quot;(Laughter)&quot;&#39;I give life and I take it away.Forgive me, for I know not what I do.&#39;
时间：11:14
zh-cn:最后,我在朋友面前倒塌了,然后每个人都想说服我去继续服用药物我在也不能否定事实了,而且我无法改变这样一个事实那堵隔离我,Elyn还有Saks教授的墙与那个疯女人住院的年头所隔离在废墟中倒塌.&quot;
en:Eventually, I broke down in front of friends, andeverybody convinced me to take more medication.I could no longer deny the truth,and I could not change it.The wall that kept me, Elyn, Professor Saks,separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past,lay smashed and in ruins.&quot;
时间：11:31
zh-cn:任何关于此疾病都暗示我不应该在这里但是我还是在这里.我觉得吧..有三个原因:第一,我已经有了极好的治疗了一周四到五次的心理分析和心理治疗持续了几十年,以及非常先进的心理配药第一,我有我的家庭成员都朋友都知道我和我的疾病这些关系给我的人生一个意味和一个深度,他们还帮助我在这些症状面前找到生活的方向第三,我在一个极具支持力的工作环境里工作就在USC法律学校这是一个不仅仅满足我需求的地方而且实际上它拥抱我的需求它也同样是一个刺激思考的地方能够使我的脑子充满各种复杂的问题这些都是最强有力最有依赖性的抵御我精神疾病的武器
en:Everything about this illness says I shouldn&#39;t be here,but I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons:First, I&#39;ve had excellent treatment.Four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapyfor decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology.Second, I have many close family members and friends who know meand know my illness.These relationships have given my life a meaningand a depth, and they also helped me navigatemy life in the face of symptoms.Third, I work at an enormously supportive workplaceat USC Law School.This is a place that not only accommodates my needsbut actually embraces them.It&#39;s also a very intellectually stimulating place,and occupying my mind with complex problemshas been my best and most powerful and most reliabledefense against my mental illness.
时间：12:16
zh-cn:即使这些全都有—-良好的治疗,融合的家庭和朋友,和谐的工作环境—直到很晚我才公开了我这个疾病因为与精神疾病作斗争的烙印太强大了以至于我想让别人知道如果你今天啥都没听到,你一定得记住这一点:这些都不是&quot;精神分裂症&quot;而是患有精神分裂症的人们,而这些人可能是你的配偶,也可能是你的孩子可能是你的邻居,也可能是你的朋友还有可能是你的同事
en:Even with all that — excellent treatment, wonderful family andfriends, supportive work environment —I did not make my illness publicuntil relatively late in life,and that&#39;s because the stigma against mental illnessis so powerful that I didn&#39;t feel safe with people knowing.If you hear nothing else today,please hear this: There are not &quot;schizophrenics.&quot;There are people with schizophrenia, and these peoplemay be your spouse, they may be your child,they may be your neighbor, they may be your friend,they may be your coworker.
时间：12:45
zh-cn:好吧.我就说说我最后的想法我们需要为精神疾病的研究和治疗进行更多的资源投资我们理解这些疾病越到位,我们能提供的治疗就越先进,这样一来,我们就能给人们带来更多的关怀而且不需要使用外力而且,我们应该停止将精神疾病最恶化说洛杉矶监狱是美国最大的心理医疗机构是国家的悲剧和谣言美国的监狱是那些被精神疾病所折磨的人占领的,而且很多人在那是因为他们从未接受过足够的治疗我当初可以轻松地沦落到大家上一条对娱乐行业和新闻业的建议:整体来说,你们在与烙印和各种偏见斗争中干得很不错拜托了,继续让我们在你们的电影中,你的戏剧中,你们的专栏中,看到那些受严重精神疾病折磨的人同情地描述他们,并且有深度地挖掘他们,通过他们亲身的经验而不是简单的一个诊断
en:So let me share some final thoughts.We need to invest more resources into research and treatmentof mental illness.The better we understand these illnesses, the betterthe treatments we can provide, and the better the treatmentswe can provide, the more we can offer people care,and not have to use force.Also, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.It&#39;s a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jailis the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.American prisons and jails are filled with people who sufferfrom severe mental illness, and many of them are therebecause they never received adequate treatment.I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself.A message to the entertainment industry and to the press:On the whole, you&#39;ve done a wonderful job fighting stigmaand prejudice of many kinds.Please, continue to let us see characters in your movies,your plays, your columns,who suffer with severe mental illness.Portray them sympathetically,and portray them in all the richness and depthof their experience as people and not as diagnoses.

zh-cn:最近,我朋友提出一个问题:如果我手里有一片瞬间可以治好我的药片,我吃不吃它?诗人Rainer Maria Rilke被提供了心理分析他拒绝了,说到:&quot;不要把我的邪恶拿走,因为我的天使也有可能逃跑.&quot;而我的精神病是一个现实的噩梦,里面的恶魔十分可怕以至于所有的天使都逃走了那么我会不会吃掉那个药片了?我不希望被看作是对于如果我没有精神疾病我会拥有的生活所后悔而我也不是在向任何人寻求怜悯我实际想说的是我们所共享的人性比精神疾病要重要的多那些经历过精神疾病的人想要的要是其他所有人想要的Sigmund Freud说到:&quot;去工作,去爱.&quot;
en:Recently, a friend posed a question:If there were a pill I could takethat would instantly cure me, would I take it?The poet Rainer Maria Rilkewas offered psychoanalysis.He declined, saying, &quot;Don&#39;t take my devils away,because my angels may flee too.&quot;My psychosis, on the other hand,is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifyingthat all my angels have already fled.So would I take the pill? In an instant.That said, I don&#39;t wish to be seen as regrettingthe life I could have had if I&#39;d not been mentally ill,nor am I asking anyone for their pity.What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all shareis more important than the mental illness we may not.What those of us who suffer with mental illness wantis what everybody wants:in the words of Sigmund Freud, &quot;to work and to love.&quot;
