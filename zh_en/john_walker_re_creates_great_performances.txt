zh-cn:我们中百分之九十九的人都有做听众的梦想.不是去做音乐家,而是做听众,对吧?而且我们渴望一件事情,尽管我们可能并不总会意识到这点.我们渴望和音乐家在一个房间里在录音的那天,在演奏的那天.然后我们去听现场音乐会,去尽可能地享受我们在现场所能感受的一切.但是我们听到的另外百分之九十九的东西都是录音.而结果你越是探寻历史久远的,声音听起来就越有点儿粗糙.所以我们说,应该想个办法解决它.让我们把演奏作为一个事情分开,以区别于录音,后者是制作的结果.你们知道,在那个年代,屋里都是麦克风.但演奏本事在于音乐家如何活动他们的手指,以及他们使用的是什么乐器.需要的是那些隐藏在录音背后的数据.为了做到这点,需要有很多的硬件和软件需要有很高的分辨率.所以雅马哈做了一件不可思议的东西叫做Disklavier Pro,看起来像摆在那儿的漂亮的大钢琴 —而且你可能都没意识到它可以完成所有这些事情 —但它布满了螺线管,光纤,和计算机和所有这类东西 — 它拥有在日本最高的分辨率.但这些都不管用,直道我们越过高清晰度这条线.而我们能够越过这条线,把它称作不可逾越的峡谷,按照人工智能的说法.我们有一套程序,你们知道,可以把它输入电脑,数字化,然后进行一系列分析.然后我们看每一个音符,以及所有这些音符的特征:用了多大劲儿弹奏,如何被控制,还包括你如何移动手指.所以我们发展出一整套你是如何移动手指的全新科学.而且,你们知道,钢琴老师教过你这些,但我们还从来没有一门科学研究背后的这些事情.
en:Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.Not being the musicians — the listeners, right?And we crave one thing,even though we kind of don&#39;t know it all the time.We crave to be in the room with the musicianthe day it was recorded, the day it was played.And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.And it turns out the further back you go in history,the little rougher it sounds.And so we said, there&#39;s a solution to this.Let&#39;s separate the performance, as a thing,out from the recording, which was how it was made.You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,and what instruments they were using.And it&#39;s the data hidden inside the recording.In order to do this, it&#39;s a lot of hardware and softwarethat runs in a very high resolution.And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Prothat looks like a nice grand piano there.And you probably didn&#39;t realize it&#39;s going to do all these things —but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computersand all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan.And this just didn&#39;t work until we could cross this line that says high-definition.And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley,in terms of — artificial intelligence terms.We have a process where we, you know,kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis.And we look at every single note,and all the attributes of those notes:how hard they were struck, and how they were held down,and how you move the fingers.So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers.And, you know, it&#39;s a thing your piano teacher teaches you,but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.

zh-cn:我要从格伦·古尔德开始.他25年前去世,75年前出生.是备受喜爱的钢琴家,也许是二十世纪最受崇拜的钢琴家.他就是厌倦了出现在听众面前,而且觉得像是&quot;一只演奏的猴子,&quot;这实际是他的原话.所以他退居幕后,不干其他事,专心磨练演奏技巧.古尔德最为擅长演奏巴赫.也许他最有名的录音是&quot;戈德堡变奏曲.&quot;巴赫曾经只写过主题和变奏曲.他写过一些早期作品,但他的晚年,在他的成熟时期,他说,&quot;这是一个主题 — 30种变奏.&quot;实际上这个主题甚至不是旋律,而是基本音.于是古尔德录制了两个版本的唱片,这你们可能知道,一个是未经处理的独奏,一个是立体声.顺便说一句,在独奏里,他使用了脚踏板,而当他年纪大些之后,他说,&quot;不,不,等一下.&quot;&quot;我想把它做得更科学而不用脚踏板.&quot;我想让你们在现场听到的是1955年版,我们将放它的前几首.格伦·古尔德, 1955年.(音乐)怎么样?(掌声)
en:I&#39;m going to start with Glenn Gould.He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year.Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century.He just got tired of being in front of an audience,and felt like — a performing monkey was, in fact, his term.So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work.And Gould&#39;s specialty was playing Bach.His maybe most famous recordingwas something called &quot;The Goldberg Variations.&quot;Bach only wrote themes and variations one time.He wrote some early pieces,but late in his life, in his mature period,he said, &quot;Here&#39;s a theme — 30 variations.&quot;In fact, the theme isn&#39;t even the melody, it&#39;s the bass line.And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about,one in mono, and one in stereo.And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal,and as he got older, he said, &quot;No, no, wait a minute.I&#39;m going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal.&quot;What I&#39;d like you to hear live is the 1955 version,and we&#39;ll play the first couple pieces of it.Glenn Gould, 1955.(Music)How about that?(Applause)

zh-cn:那么让我来告诉你这是如何完成的.首先,让我告诉你最后一步.那就是 — 我们有一个相当复杂的过程你们知道,这些软件,音乐家等等但我们全部做完的时候,我们知道,耳朵才是最终的裁判.我们可以一个耳朵听原版,另一个耳朵听新版录音.所以我现在要为你们做的,就是你们刚才所听到的.在右边的喇叭传出的是原版左边的喇叭传出的是新版 —实际上就像那架大钢琴一样的乐器,我将同时播放这两个版本.(音乐)这是原版.(音乐)
en:So let me tell you a little bit how this was done.First of all, let me get you to the end step.This is — we have a fairly complex processthat, you know, software and musicians and so on,but when we&#39;re all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter.We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other.So I&#39;m going to do this for you right now, what you just heard.And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording,and the left speaker is going to be the new recording,actually of an instrument just like that one,and I&#39;m going to play them together at the same time.(Music)That&#39;s the original. [Unclear] That&#39;s the two together.(Music)

zh-cn:在&quot;侏罗纪公园&quot;之前,没有一门科学是研究皮肤是怎样悬挂在肌肉上的,对吧?所以在影像世界里,我们可能在有生之年去创造一些自然行为.而这也算是另一个例子在自然行为背后建立一门科学.然后你将听到原版音乐.最终,我开始进行体验.这个体验就是:我想在这间屋子里,听到音乐家的演奏.你们中很多人能买得起这样一架&quot;大钢琴.&quot;但如果买不起,现在有高清晰度环绕立体声.而且我要告诉你,如果你还没听过高清晰环绕立体声,去找你们的音响经销商,爱好唱片的经销商.相比普通的立体声,会感觉非常沉醉.但如果你没有那种立体声,也许你可以通过你的耳机听到.同一张唱片我们有五份录音 —索尼有五份录音.因此你可以从耳机里听到通过这个叫双耳式录音的东西.这是一个头的模型,它坐在乐器前,在耳朵的地方装有麦克风.当你戴上耳机听它的时候,你就好像进入了格伦·古尔德的身体.这像是个笑话,但直到,你们知道,那些音乐家,那些弹钢琴的音乐家们听到这个,他们说,&quot;我简直不敢相信!就好像是在弹钢琴.&quot;只是现在你是在格伦·格伦古尔德的身体里弹钢琴,而且感觉像是你的手指在做决定在移动中完成整个过程.这是一个游戏的改变者.
en:Before &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot;there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?So, in the video world,we&#39;ve been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.And this is kind of another exampleof putting a science behind natural behavior.And then you heard the original.Ultimately, I started with the experience.And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.Lots of you can afford to buy one of these.But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.And I got to tell you, if you haven&#39;t heard high-definition surround,go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.It&#39;s so involving compared to regular stereo.But if you don&#39;t have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.And so on the same disk we have five recordings —Sony has five recordings.And you could listen in headphoneswith this thing called binaural recording.And it&#39;s a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,and it&#39;s got microphones where the ears are.And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,you&#39;re inside of Glenn Gould&#39;s body.And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,&quot;I can&#39;t believe it! It&#39;s just what it&#39;s like to play the piano.&quot;Except now you&#39;re inside Glenn Gould&#39;s body playing the piano,and it feels like your fingers are making the decisionsand moving through the whole process.It&#39;s a game changer.

zh-cn:这就是现在我们所知的达到惊人品质的东西.整个过程对温度和湿度是非常敏感的.今天你们所听到的还不是最完美的.这是由木头,铸铁和毡制品制成的混合物,还有钢丝以及所有这些,而且他们都对温度和湿度出奇地敏感.所以当你在录音期间,如果有必要,你要在每首曲子之后停下来重建钢琴.整个行动等在一边,那个头部模型和我们的录音师们站在一旁等我们重建钢琴.没有把日期标在这些东西上,一步一步地,音乐就变成了数据,就像在过去35到40年间每个领域所发生的事情一样.声音很晚才进入这个领域 —我不是说数字化, 字节，重新灌录之类 —我是说把它变成音乐来源的数据,音乐也是这样被演奏的.声音很晚才被数据化是因为我们的耳朵太难被欺骗了—它们有很高的分辨力,直接与我们的情感相连,所以你不能轻易地欺骗它们.眼睛倒是很乐于看到一些颜色和运动
en:Here&#39;s now something we know in spectacular quality.The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity.What you heard today was not perfect.It&#39;s an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt,and steel strings, and all these,and they&#39;re all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity.So when you go into the recording session,you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to.There&#39;s the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side,and the dummy head and our recording engineersstanding around while we rebuild the piano.Without putting dates next to these things,step-by-step music will be turned into data,like every field that&#39;s occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.Audio has come very late to this game —I&#39;m not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.I&#39;m talking about turn it into the data that it was made from,which is how it was performed.And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool —they&#39;re high-resolution, and they&#39;re wired straight to our emotions,and you can&#39;t trick them very easily.Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.

zh-cn:好吧,比如有一集&quot;星际旅行.&quot;(笑声)我明白了 — 这些是昨天才为我摆在这里的.对我而言,这集&quot;星际旅行&quot;是由詹姆斯·达利扮演玛士撒拉 —记得这集么?有一段是他跳舞,带着他的—我不会给你毁了这集,是1967年的.是的,你们知道我接下来要说什么?尼莫伊,不好意思,是斯波克坐在钢琴前,他开始弹奏勃拉姆斯的华尔兹,他们都随音乐起舞.然后斯波克转身说,&quot;詹姆斯,我知道勃拉姆斯的所有华尔兹,我不认为这首是其中之一.&quot;这正是我要说的.我想听勃拉姆斯没有写过的华尔兹.我想听霍罗威茨没有演奏过的曲子.但我相信当我们有了数据,我们就有了出路我们可以提取风格,模式,公式和所有这些东西 —再一次地,就像你在电脑图像世界里看到的.现在它真地来到了这个世界上.转变就是这一点.就是说现在我们认为音乐是一堆音符以及如何演奏这些音符.我认为这即将成为事实.因为你们刚才听到的是一台电脑在演奏数据 —而不是格伦·古尔德在这个屋里.但它又是很人性的.而且我相信你们会达到下一个目标,就是成为聆听者的梦想.每次你听到一张今天的录音,每次你掏出你的iPod或者无论什么,每次你听它,总是一样的 — 被定格了.如果每次听的时候,都能听到不一样的效果,会不会很爽呢?比如今天早上你比较伤心,你仍然想听你的音乐,同样的曲子,但比昨天弹奏得更伤感.你想听到不同音乐家对同一曲目的演奏.你想在不同的房间里听或无论什么条件.
en:All right, there&#39;s this episode of &quot;Star Trek.&quot;(Laughter)I get it — it was all just laid in for me yesterday there.The episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; for me was James Daly played Methuselah —remember this one?And at some point he&#39;s dancing with his —and I won&#39;t ruin the episode for you, from 1967.Right, do you know where I&#39;m going?And Nimoy, I&#39;m sorry, Spock sits down at the piano,and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.And then Spock turns round, he goes,&quot;James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes,and I don&#39;t believe this is one of them in the category.&quot;That&#39;s where I&#39;m at.I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn&#39;t write.I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn&#39;t play.But I believe we&#39;re on a path now, when we get to data,that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,again, that you&#39;ve seen happen in the computer graphics world.It&#39;s now coming in this world.The transition will be this one.It says right now, we think music is notes and how they&#39;re played.And I believe this is coming.Because what you&#39;ve just heard was a computer playing data —no Glenn Gould in the room.But yet, it was human.And I believe you&#39;ll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners.Every time you listen to a recording today,every time you take out your iPod and whatever,every time you listen to it, it&#39;s the same thing — it&#39;s frozen.Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different?This morning, you&#39;re sadder, you want to hear your song,the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.You want to hear it played by different musicians.You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.

zh-cn:我们已经看过一系列&quot;星际旅行,&quot;这些全是在仿真空间中进行的.每次我听到那个,我都起鸡皮疙瘩.这太令人惊异了,太令人兴奋了.每次我听那个录音,就像是,哦我的天啊,我简直不能相信我是在同一间房里,我不敢相信这确实能发生.这是比以往好得多的体验好于任何你通常听的,任何形式的东西.最后,我用一分钟的时间介绍亚瑟·泰特姆作为结束.我恐怕真得要超出我预计的演讲时间了.我们为他做了一张新唱片是九月份在Shrine音乐厅(洛杉矶)演奏的.这是1949年他在Shrine音乐厅录制的音乐会.我必须告诉你,我们有这样一个实验室在北卡罗来那州的罗利,我们可以建造和测验一切,然后我们飞到洛杉矶.作为公司总裁,我对我们曾经待的地方感觉并不特别舒服.那是一种非常不舒服的感觉当所有器械都被搬出来,整个索尼团队,和大家要做到听众席里.我们把钢琴放到Shrine音乐厅舞台上和原来一样的位置 —这个音乐厅自1949年来就没有变过,一直能容纳六千人 —在那个位置上,泰特姆开始了他的演奏...每个音符,每个节拍,每个连音,每个重音,每次使用脚踏盘都是完美的,因为他曾经就在同一时间同一地点演奏过.我们捕捉了全部数据并得以再现.我想让你们现在听听.幸运地是,它就在这里 —这是他曾经的返场曲目.时长一分钟.它是一种爱尔兰快步舞曲,我想让你听到他的幽默.(音乐)(掌声)这正是现场听众们的反应.(掌声)非常感谢,麦克,谢谢你提供的机会.
en:We&#39;ve seen all these &quot;Star Treks,&quot; and they&#39;re all holodeck episodes as well.Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.It&#39;s so amazing, it&#39;s so exciting.Every time I listen to that recording it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh my God,I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m in the same room. I can&#39;t believe this is happening.&quot;It&#39;s a way better experiencethan whatever you&#39;re used to listening to, in whatever form.And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum.So I&#39;ve really overshot my budget here.We made a new recording of himplaying in the Shrine Auditorium in September.It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.And I&#39;ve got to tell you, we have this labwhere we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina,and we flew out to Los Angeles.And as the president of the company,I didn&#39;t feel real comfortable about where we were.That&#39;s a real uncomfortable feeling,when all the equipment&#39;s come out and a whole Sony team,and people are going to be sitting there in the audience.And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ...and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedalwas perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.And we captured all that data all over again.And I want you to hear that right now.And fortunately, it&#39;s right in here.This is an encore he used to do.It&#39;s one minute long.It&#39;s an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor.(Music)(Applause)And that&#39;s just what the live audience did.(Applause)So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.
