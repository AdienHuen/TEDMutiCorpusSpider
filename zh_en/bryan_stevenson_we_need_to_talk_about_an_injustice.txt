zh-cn:很荣幸来到这里我大多数时候都在管教所，在监狱里，在死囚室中大部分时间我在低收入的社区里工作在充满绝望的地区，做前途暗淡的项目今天来到TED看到听到这些激动人心的演讲给了我一针强心剂在这短短的时间里，我注意到TED有自己的定位你可以看到这里发生的事情影响全世界有时当事情发生在TED的讲台上比发生在别处更有意义，更有影响
en:Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me.I spend most of my timein jails, in prisons, on death row.I spend most of my time in very low-income communitiesin the projects and places where there&#39;s a great deal of hopelessness.And being here at TEDand seeing the stimulation, hearing it,has been very, very energizing to me.And one of the things that&#39;s emerged in my short time hereis that TED has an identity.And you can actually say things herethat have impacts around the world.And sometimes when it comes through TED,it has meaning and powerthat it doesn&#39;t have when it doesn&#39;t.

zh-cn:我提起这个是因为我觉得自我定位很重要我们已经听了一些精彩的演说我们已经体会到作为一个老师，你的话是有影响力的如果你是个很慈善的老师你的教导就格外意味深长作为一个医生，你能够帮助人如果你是个体恤病人的医生，你能帮助更多所以我想讲讲定位的重要性我不是从做律师或者做其他项目学到怎样自我定位的我其实是从我外婆那里学到的
en:And I mention that because I think identity is really important.And we&#39;ve had some fantastic presentations.And I think what we&#39;ve learnedis that, if you&#39;re a teacher your words can be meaningful,but if you&#39;re a compassionate teacher,they can be especially meaningful.If you&#39;re a doctor you can do some good things,but if you&#39;re a caring doctor you can do some other things.And so I want to talk about the power of identity.And I didn&#39;t learn about this actuallypracticing law and doing the work that I do.I actually learned about this from my grandmother.

zh-cn:我的家庭是一个传统的黑人家庭只有一个女家长就是我的外婆她很坚韧， 也很强壮威风凛凛家里有争执，她有决定权不过很多事儿也是她挑起来的她的父母曾是真正的黑奴弗吉尼亚州19世纪40年代，她父母落草为奴我外婆是十九世纪八十年代生的这段父母被奴役的经历决定了她看世界的角度
en:I grew up in a housethat was the traditional African-American homethat was dominated by a matriarch,and that matriarch was my grandmother.She was tough, she was strong,she was powerful.She was the end of every argument in our family.She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840&#39;s.She was born in the 1880&#39;sand the experience of slaveryvery much shaped the way she saw the world.

zh-cn:我的外婆很强势，但她也很慈爱当我是个小男孩时每次见到她都拥抱我她抱得那么紧，我都透不过气来然后她才会放开我一两个小时之后，当我再见她她会过来问我：“还能感觉我的拥抱么？”如果我说“感觉不到了”，她就再度出击直到我说“感觉得到”，她才放开我她就是有这个能力让你老是想亲近她唯一的挑战是她有十个儿女我妈妈是十个里最年轻的常常当我去和外婆亲近时很难让她注意到我，有时间陪我我的表兄妹们总是无处不在
en:And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.When I would see her as a little boy,she&#39;d come up to me and she&#39;d give me these hugs.And she&#39;d squeeze me so tight I could barely breatheand then she&#39;d let me go.And an hour or two later, if I saw her,she&#39;d come over to me and she&#39;d say, &quot;Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?&quot;And if I said, &quot;No,&quot; she&#39;d assault me again,and if I said, &quot;Yes,&quot; she&#39;d leave me alone.And she just had this qualitythat you always wanted to be near her.And the only challenge was that she had 10 children.My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,it would be difficult to get her time and attention.My cousins would be running around everywhere.

zh-cn:我记得，当我八九岁时的一次我早上醒来，跑到客厅所有的表兄妹都在我外婆坐在房间的另一端盯着我看一开始我以为我们在玩游戏我就看回去，对她笑笑但我外婆是很严肃的大概十五还是二十分钟之后她站起来，穿过房间牵住我的手对我说：“过来，布莱恩，我们得谈谈。”这就像是昨天才发生的一样我永远忘不掉
en:And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old,waking up one morning, going into the living room,and all of my cousins were running around.And my grandmother was sitting across the roomstaring at me.And at first I thought we were playing a game.And I would look at her and I&#39;d smile,but she was very serious.And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,she got up and she came across the roomand she took me by the handand she said, &quot;Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk.&quot;And I remember this just like it happened yesterday.I never will forget it.

zh-cn:她把我带到一边说：“我想和你说些事，你不许和任何人说。”我答应了：“好的，姥姥。”她说：“保证绝不说出去。”我回答：“保证。”然后我们坐下，她看着我说：“我想让你知道我观察你一段时间了。”接着她说：“你是个特别的孩子。”她说：“我确信你是无所不能的。”这我永远不会忘记
en:She took me out back and she said, &quot;Bryan, I&#39;m going to tell you something,but you don&#39;t tell anybody what I tell you.&quot;I said, &quot;Okay, Mama.&quot;She said, &quot;Now you make sure you don&#39;t do that.&quot; I said, &quot;Sure.&quot;Then she sat me down and she looked at meand she said, &quot;I want you to knowI&#39;ve been watching you.&quot;And she said, &quot;I think you&#39;re special.&quot;She said, &quot;I think you can do anything you want to do.&quot;I will never forget it.

zh-cn:接着她说：“我想让你向我保证三件事。”我说：“好的姥姥。”她说：“第一，我想让你保证你会永远爱你的妈妈。”她说：“你妈妈是我的心头肉，你得向我保证你会永远爱护她。”我很爱我妈妈，我说：“好，姥姥，我会。”接着她说：“第二件事，是你要答应我你会永远走正路即使走正路是很难的选择。”我想了想回答：“好的姥姥，我会的。”最后她说：“第三件事，我要你保证你永不喝酒。”（笑声）我才九岁，我答应：“好，姥姥，我保证。”
en:And then she said, &quot;I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan.&quot;I said, &quot;Okay, Mama.&quot;She said, &quot;The first thing I want you to promise meis that you&#39;ll always love your mom.&quot;She said, &quot;That&#39;s my baby girl,and you have to promise me now you&#39;ll always take care of her.&quot;Well I adored my mom, so I said, &quot;Yes, Mama. I&#39;ll do that.&quot;Then she said, &quot;The second thing I want you to promise meis that you&#39;ll always do the right thingeven when the right thing is the hard thing.&quot;And I thought about it and I said, &quot;Yes, Mama. I&#39;ll do that.&quot;Then finally she said, &quot;The third thing I want you to promise meis that you&#39;ll never drink alcohol.&quot;(Laughter)Well I was nine years old, so I said, &quot;Yes, Mama. I&#39;ll do that.&quot;

zh-cn:我在南部的乡下长大我有个哥哥大我一岁，还有个妹妹小我一岁当我十四五岁时一天我哥哥带回到家半打啤酒——我都不知道他怎么弄到的——他带上我和我妹妹，跑到树林里一通疯玩疯跑他喝了一口啤酒，递给我妹妹，她也喝了然后他们递给了我我说：“我不要。没事，你们喝。我不喝。”我哥哥说：“来嘛，我们今个儿都喝。你老是和我们一条阵线的。我喝了点，妹妹也喝了点，你来些。”我说：“不，我不想喝。你们喝你们喝。”我哥哥盯住我问：“你有什么毛病？喝一点。”接着他细细打量了我一会，问我：“噢，你不会还想着姥姥要你保证的事吧。”（笑声）我说：“你在说什么呀？”他说：“姥姥和每个外孙都说他很特别。”（笑声）我这个伤心呀
en:I grew up in the country in the rural South,and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.When I was about 14 or 15,one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer —I don&#39;t know where he got it —and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods.And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did.And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some,and they offered it to me.I said, &quot;No, no, no. That&#39;s okay. You all go ahead. I&#39;m not going to have any beer.&quot;My brother said, &quot;Come on. We&#39;re doing this today; you always do what we do.I had some, your sister had some. Have some beer.&quot;I said, &quot;No, I don&#39;t feel right about that. Y&#39;all go ahead. Y&#39;all go ahead.&quot;And then my brother started staring at me.He said, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you? Have some beer.&quot;Then he looked at me real hard and he said,&quot;Oh, I hope you&#39;re not still hung upon that conversation Mama had with you.&quot;(Laughter)I said, &quot;Well, what are you talking about?&quot;He said, &quot;Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they&#39;re special.&quot;(Laughter)I was devastated.

zh-cn:现在我想向大家坦白一件事可能不该在这里说因为这个演讲是会到处播的我今年五十二了我要向大家承认我从来没有喝过一滴酒（掌声）这不是为了显派我多有道德是为了说明自我定位的威力当我们决定了正确的定位我们就可以让全世界接受他们本来想不到的事情我们能让世界做他们本来觉得做不到的事情当我想到我的外婆她当然觉得每个外孙都很特别我的外公因为违了禁在蹲监狱我不止一个舅舅死与和酗酒有关的疾病这些原则都是我外婆相信我们应该坚持的
en:And I&#39;m going to admit something to you.I&#39;m going to tell you something I probably shouldn&#39;t.I know this might be broadcast broadly.But I&#39;m 52 years old,and I&#39;m going to admit to youthat I&#39;ve never had a drop of alcohol.(Applause)I don&#39;t say that because I think that&#39;s virtuous;I say that because there is power in identity.When we create the right kind of identity,we can say things to the world around usthat they don&#39;t actually believe makes sense.We can get them to do thingsthat they don&#39;t think they can do.When I thought about my grandmother,of course she would think all her grandkids were special.My grandfather was in prison during prohibition.My male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases.And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to.

zh-cn:我想向大家介绍的是我们刑事执法系统和四十年前比这个国家变了很多在1972年，监狱里只有三十万人今天，有两百三十万今天美国是世界上服刑人口比例最高的国家我们有七百万人在缓刑期和假释期在我看来，这样的大量判刑完全改变了我们的世界在贫穷的社区里，在有色人种社区里充满了绝望这样的绝望是由这些改变带来的三分之一的黑人男性十八岁到三十岁之间的不是在监狱里，就是在缓刑期或者假释期在全国各处的城市社区里——洛杉矶，费城，巴尔的摩，华盛顿——百分之五十到六十的有色人种的年轻人不是在监狱里，就是在缓刑期或者假释期
en:Well I&#39;ve been trying to say somethingabout our criminal justice system.This country is very different todaythan it was 40 years ago.In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.Today, there are 2.3 million.The United States now has the highest rate of incarcerationin the world.We have seven million people on probation and parole.And mass incarceration, in my judgment,has fundamentally changed our world.In poor communities, in communities of colorthere is this despair,there is this hopelessness,that is being shaped by these outcomes.One out of three black menbetween the ages of 18 and 30is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole.In urban communities across this country —Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington —50 to 60 percent of all young men of color arein jail or prison or on probation or parole.

zh-cn:我们的司法系统不仅是改变了而是围绕着种族问题扭曲了也围绕着贫困扭曲了这个国家的司法系统会对你特殊照顾如果你是有罪的富人而不是无辜的穷人的话财富，而不是过失本身决定了最终结果可是，我们还挺自在的呢玩弄恐惧和愤怒的政治手腕说服了我们事不关己高高挂起
en:Our system isn&#39;t just being shapedin these ways that seem to be distorting around race,they&#39;re also distorted by poverty.We have a system of justice in this countrythat treats you much betterif you&#39;re rich and guilty than if you&#39;re poor and innocent.Wealth, not culpability,shapes outcomes.And yet, we seem to be very comfortable.The politics of fear and angerhave made us believethat these are problems that are not our problems.We&#39;ve been disconnected.

zh-cn:我对这个很感兴趣我们日常工作能看一些很有意思的变革我所在的阿拉巴马州，像很多其他州一样如果你被判有罪就终身剥夺你的政治权力现在在阿拉巴马州百分之三十四的黑人男性永远失去了投票权我们向前看十年这个剥夺政治权利的比例将和投票权法案通过之前一样的高可是没人提半个字
en:It&#39;s interesting to me.We&#39;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work.My state of Alabama, like a number of states,actually permanently disenfranchises youif you have a criminal conviction.Right now in Alabama34 percent of the black male populationhas permanently lost the right to vote.We&#39;re actually projecting in another 10 yearsthe level of disenfranchisementwill be as high as it&#39;s beensince prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.And there is this stunning silence.

zh-cn:我代表孩子们上庭很多我的被告都很年轻美国是世界上唯一能将十三岁的孩子判成终身监禁的国家我国对孩子判终身监禁，还不得假释我们其实现在就在帮这些人上诉世界上独一份
en:I represent children.A lot of my clients are very young.The United States is the only country in the worldwhere we sentence 13-year-old childrento die in prison.We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country.And we&#39;re actually doing some litigation.The only country in the world.

zh-cn:我也代理死刑犯的官司死刑这件事很发人深省我们从各种渠道了解到（死刑的）根本问题是人该不该为他们犯的罪行偿命这是个非常合理的问题但是另一方面问题是我们的自我定位另一个想问题的方式不是人们该不该为罪行偿命而是我们配不配杀他们我是说，这个问题非常震撼
en:I represent people on death row.It&#39;s interesting, this question of the death penalty.In many ways, we&#39;ve been taught to thinkthat the real question is,do people deserve to die for the crimes they&#39;ve committed?And that&#39;s a very sensible question.But there&#39;s another way of thinkingabout where we are in our identity.The other way of thinking about itis not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit,but do we deserve to kill?I mean, it&#39;s fascinating.
时间： 8:15
zh-cn:死刑在美国是常有差错的每九个被判死刑的人有一个后来会被证明无罪被免死刑这种错误率——九分之一的人完全无辜我得说，非常震撼学航空的人知道，如果每九架飞机里会有一架出事故我们肯定是不会让这玩意儿载人飞的但是莫名其妙地我们就能忽视死刑的问题因为这不是我们自身的问题这不是我们自身的麻烦这不是我们自身的挣扎
en:Death penalty in America is defined by error.For every nine people who have been executed,we&#39;ve actually identified one innocent personwho&#39;s been exonerated and released from death row.A kind of astonishing error rate —one out of nine people innocent.I mean, it&#39;s fascinating.In aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanesif for every nine planes that took offone would crash.But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.It&#39;s not our problem.It&#39;s not our burden.It&#39;s not our struggle.
时间： 8:49
zh-cn:我谈了很多问题种族，还有我们配不配执行死刑这很发人深省。当我教美国黑人历史的时候我和学生讲奴隶制和他们讲恐怖主义那个始于大复兴晚期一直到二战时期的时代我们并不真的了解那段历史但是对于这个国家的黑人来说那是个白色恐怖时代在很多社区，人们害怕随时会被私刑处死人们担心随时会被炸弹袭击那个白色恐怖时代，改变了他们的生活那时的人现在上了年纪，来和我说“史蒂文森先生，你到处演讲你得告诉大家别说什么911以后是我们美国有史以来第一次对付恐怖主义。”他们让我说：“我们就是在恐怖里长大的。”那个恐怖主义的时代，当然了最后演变成了无法逾越的鸿沟数十年的种族歧视和种族隔离
en:I talk a lot about these issues.I talk about race and this questionof whether we deserve to kill.And it&#39;s interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history,I tell them about slavery.I tell them about terrorism,the era that began at the end of reconstructionthat went on to World War II.We don&#39;t really know very much about it.But for African-Americans in this country,that was an era defined by terror.In many communities, people had to worry about being lynched.They had to worry about being bombed.It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives.And these older people come up to me nowand they say, &quot;Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches,you tell people to stop sayingwe&#39;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation&#39;s historyafter 9/11.&quot;They tell me to say, &quot;No, tell them that we grew up with that.&quot;And that era of terrorism, of course,was followed by segregationand decades of racial subordinationand apartheid.

zh-cn:然而，我们这个国家不喜欢讨论存在的问题我们不喜欢讨论历史正因如此，我们不能真正理解我们有史以来做了什么我们不停地产生冲突不停地制造紧张气氛我们没法讨论种族问题我相信是因为我们不愿意正视一系列的事实，不愿意达成和解在南非，人们知道我们不能忘记种族隔离除非我们诚实面对，达成和解在卢旺达，即使种族灭绝后，人们还是正视了但是在美国我们不愿意这么干
en:And yet, we have in this country this dynamicwhere we really don&#39;t like to talk about our problems.We don&#39;t like to talk about our history.And because of that, we really haven&#39;t understoodwhat it&#39;s meant to do the things we&#39;ve done historically.We&#39;re constantly running into each other.We&#39;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts.We have a hard time talking about race,and I believe it&#39;s because we are unwilling to commit ourselvesto a process of truth and reconciliation.In South Africa, people understoodthat we couldn&#39;t overcome apartheidwithout a commitment to truth and reconciliation.In Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment,but in this country we haven&#39;t done that.

zh-cn:我也在德国谈过死刑的问题结果很绝妙因为在讲谈后有个学者站起来说：“你要知道，听你谈这个很痛心。”她说：“我们德国没有死刑。当然了，我们德国永远也不可能有死刑。”全场肃静这位女士说：“因为我们的历史，我们永不可能决定有系统地杀人。公开化且下意识地执行死刑，对我们来说是良心上无法接受的我思考了这个问题如果我整天都看着德国人杀人毫无道理地屠杀犹太人我会有什么感受？我无法忍受那真是太不合理了
en:I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty.It was fascinatingbecause one of the scholars stood up after the presentationand said, &quot;Well you know it&#39;s deeply troublingto hear what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;He said, &quot;We don&#39;t have the death penalty in Germany.And of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany.&quot;And the room got very quiet,and this woman said,&quot;There&#39;s no way, with our history,we could ever engagein the systematic killing of human beings.It would be unconscionable for usto, in an intentional and deliberate way,set about executing people.&quot;And I thought about that.What would it feel liketo be living in a worldwhere the nation state of Germany was executing people,especially if they were disproportionately Jewish?I couldn&#39;t bear it.It would be unconscionable.

zh-cn:但是，在我们这个国家在南方各州我们真的在屠杀——当仅仅因为受害人是白人而不是黑人你被判死刑的机率上升十倍时当仅仅因为被告是黑人而不是白人你被判死刑的机率上升二十一倍时——在这些州，到处埋着被私刑处死的人可是，我们还是漠不关心
en:And yet, in this country,in the states of the Old South,we execute people —where you&#39;re 11 times more likely to get the death penaltyif the victim is white than if the victim is black,22 times more likely to get itif the defendant is black and the victim is white —in the very states where there are buried in the groundthe bodies of people who were lynched.And yet, there is this disconnect.

zh-cn:我相信这说明我们有定位危机当我们对这些棘手的问题置之不顾时我们却仍旧对那些正面的好事儿一如既往地关心我们爱极了革新我们爱技术，我们爱创造我们爱娱乐但是最终这些好的现实都被痛苦煎熬，滥用职权，剥夺人权边缘化，蒙上了阴影对于我来说两者合一是必要的因为最终我们谈的是怎么更有希望更有保障，更有贡献来应付生活在这个复杂社会中的种种挑战对于我来说那需要花时间思考和讨论穷人阶层，弱势群体那些永远也没机会来TED的人不过想着他们其实在某种意义上是把他们融合进我们的生活里
en:Well I believe that our identity is at risk.That when we actually don&#39;t careabout these difficult things,the positive and wonderful thingsare nonetheless implicated.We love innovation.We love technology. We love creativity.We love entertainment.But ultimately,those realitiesare shadowed by suffering,abuse, degradation,marginalization.And for me, it becomes necessaryto integrate the two.Because ultimately we are talkingabout a need to be more hopeful,more committed, more dedicatedto the basic challenges of living in a complex world.And for me that meansspending time thinking and talkingabout the poor, the disadvantaged,those who will never get to TED.But thinking about them in a waythat is integrated in our own lives.

zh-cn:要知道最终，我们得相信那些没亲眼见的事我们不得不。作为理智的社会，这么聪明的社会革新，创造发展，并不仅仅在我们脑子里空想出来的它们是从我们脑子里的智慧和我们心里的信念相结合的产物这个灵智合一我相信会驱使我们不仅仅是对那些光明的事情更上心同时对那些黑暗面和棘手的事情也是一样韦克拉乌·哈韦尔，这位捷克的杰出领导人，谈过这个问题他说：“当我们在东欧解决强制压迫的问题时我们希望能成就很多但是最重要的，我们要一个希望一个心灵的指向一种不惮于体会绝望的态度以及为史留证的意愿。”
en:You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven&#39;t seen.We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are.Innovation, creativity,development comesnot from the ideas in our mind alone.They come from the ideas in our mindthat are also fueledby some conviction in our heart.And it&#39;s that mind-heart connectionthat I believe compels usto not just be attentiveto all the bright and dazzly things,but also the dark and difficult things.Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.He said, &quot;When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression,we wanted all kinds of things,but mostly what we needed was hope,an orientation of the spirit,a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless placesand be a witness.&quot;
时间：13:24
zh-cn:这个心灵的指向就是我的核心信念我们的TED社会也要参与进来这里不应有任何东西把高新的科技和完美的设计和我们的人性间隔开来只要我们还能注意到痛苦注意到贫穷，制约，不公，和冤屈我想提醒大家这样的定位是很有挑战性的比起那些漠不关心的定位来说它会影响你
en:Well that orientation of the spiritis very much at the core of what I believeeven TED communitieshave to be engaged in.There is no disconnectaround technology and designthat will allow us to be fully humanuntil we pay attention to suffering,to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.Now I will warn youthat this kind of identityis a much more challenging identitythan ones that don&#39;t pay attention to this.It will get to you.

zh-cn:当我是个年轻律师，我有幸见到帕克斯夫人帕克斯夫人曾时不时会到蒙哥马利每次她都会和两个好友会面两位上了年纪的女性姜妮·卡尔，她是蒙哥马利公车抵制运动的组织者——非常出色的黑人女性——还有弗吉尼亚·杜尔，一位白人女性她丈夫克利福德·杜尔是马丁·路德·金的律师这些女士们经常聚在一起讨论问题
en:I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then,and she would get together with two of her dearest friends,these older women,Johnnie Carr who was the organizerof the Montgomery bus boycott —amazing African-American woman —and Virginia Durr, a white woman,whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.And these women would get together and just talk.
时间：14:20
zh-cn:有时卡尔夫人会给我打电话问我：“帕克斯夫人回来了，我们要聚聚。你愿不愿意来听我们谈话？”我会说：“当然，夫人，我愿意。”她会问：“你来这里具体干什么呀？”我会说：“我就想听听。”然后我会过去，只是倾听这些聚会总是非常激动和鼓舞人心的
en:And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me,and she&#39;d say, &quot;Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town. We&#39;re going to get together and talk.Do you want to come over and listen?&quot;And I&#39;d say, &quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am, I do.&quot;And she&#39;d say, &quot;Well what are you going to do when you get here?&quot;I said, &quot;I&#39;m going to listen.&quot;And I&#39;d go over there and I would, I would just listen.It would be so energizing and so empowering.
时间：14:37
zh-cn:有一次我在那里听她们谈话几小时后帕克斯夫人问我她问：“布莱恩，和我讲讲你的平等司法倡议。和我讲讲你打算做什么。”我就开始大讲特讲我说：“我们想向不公正的待遇提出挑战。我们想帮那些被误判了刑的人。我们想和在刑法制度里的偏见和歧视做对抗。给孩子被判终身无法假释的制度给终结掉。我们想为死刑制度做些改变。我们想减少监狱人口。我们还想杜绝过度泛滥的监禁。”
en:And one time I was over there listening to these women talk,and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to meand she said, &quot;Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is.Tell me what you&#39;re trying to do.&quot;And I began giving her my rap.I said, &quot;Well we&#39;re trying to challenge injustice.We&#39;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted.We&#39;re trying to confront bias and discriminationin the administration of criminal justice.We&#39;re trying to end life without parole sentences for children.We&#39;re trying to do something about the death penalty.We&#39;re trying to reduce the prison population.We&#39;re trying to end mass incarceration.&quot;

en:I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at meand she said, &quot;Mmm mmm mmm.&quot;She said, &quot;That&#39;s going to make you tired, tired, tired.&quot;(Laughter)And that&#39;s when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face,she said, &quot;That&#39;s why you&#39;ve got to be brave, brave, brave.&quot;

zh-cn:我确信TED这个社会需要更有胆量些我们需要找到出路来面对这些挑战这些问题，这些痛苦因为最终，我们的整体的人性取决于每个人的人性在我的工作中我学到了非常简单的原则我开始理解，开始相信我们每一个人都不会被我们最坏的一面所定义我相信，对于这个星球上的每一个人如果他撒了个谎，并不说明他就是个骗子如果他拿了不属于他的东西并不说明他就是个惯偷甚至你杀了人，并不说明你就是个冷血杀手因为我相信人类有基本的尊严法律必须尊重它我也相信在我们国家的很多地方当然甚至这个世界的很多地方贫穷的反面，不是富裕我不相信这个我认为，在很多很多地方贫穷的反面，是公正
en:And I actually believe that the TED communityneeds to be more courageous.We need to find waysto embrace these challenges,these problems, the suffering.Because ultimately, our humanity dependson everyone&#39;s humanity.I&#39;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do.It&#39;s just taught me very simple things.I&#39;ve come to understand and to believethat each of usis more than the worst thing we&#39;ve ever done.I believe that for every person on the planet.I think if somebody tells a lie, they&#39;re not just a liar.I think if somebody takes something that doesn&#39;t belong to them,they&#39;re not just a thief.I think even if you kill someone, you&#39;re not just a killer.And because of that there&#39;s this basic human dignitythat must be respected by law.I also believethat in many parts of this country,and certainly in many parts of this globe,that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.I don&#39;t believe that.I actually think, in too many places,the opposite of poverty is justice.

zh-cn:最后，我相信尽管（我们的科技和设计）很有声色很美妙，很鼓动人心也很刺激但我们本身最终不会被科技所评价也不会被设计所衡量我们也不会被智慧和哲学来打分最终，人们会评价我们这个社会不是根据我们怎么款待富人，有特权的人而是根据我们怎么对待穷人被谴责的人，被囚禁的人因为正是在这个合流点我们真正地开始对于我们是什么样的人有了深入的理解
en:And finally, I believethat, despite the fact that it is so dramaticand so beautiful and so inspiringand so stimulating,we will ultimately not be judged by our technology,we won&#39;t be judged by our design,we won&#39;t be judged by our intellect and reason.Ultimately, you judge the character of a society,not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged,but by how they treat the poor,the condemned, the incarcerated.Because it&#39;s in that nexusthat we actually begin to understand truly profound thingsabout who we are.

zh-cn:我常失去平衡。我想用个故事结束我的演讲我有时工作太多很累，就像大家每个人一样有时这些想法太多而思考跟不上结果是很严重的我曾经为这些孩子们辩护他们被判了很重的刑我去管教所，看见我的被告都是十三四岁他们被说成是成年人，作为成年人对待我开始想，到底是怎么一回事？一个法官，怎么能够把一个人判定成一个不同的人？这个法官说他是成年人，但我只看见一个孩子
en:I sometimes get out of balance. I&#39;ll end with this story.I sometimes push too hard.I do get tired, as we all do.Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinkingin ways that are important.And I&#39;ve been representing these kidswho have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.And I go to the jail and I see my client who&#39;s 13 and 14,and he&#39;s been certified to stand trial as an adult.I start thinking, well, how did that happen?How can a judge turn you into somethingthat you&#39;re not?And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.

zh-cn:一天晚上我彻夜难眠，不止地想天哪，如果法官能把你写成另一个人这个法官肯定有魔法对了，布莱恩，这个法官有魔法你可得学着点因为我睡得太晚，脑子不清楚我开始做一个议案我有个被告，十四岁，一个黑人小孩子我开始做他的辩护标题是：“提案：将我的十四岁的穷黑孩子想成一个七十五岁的特级白人企业高管。”
en:And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking,well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you&#39;re not,the judge must have magic power.Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.You should ask for some of that.And because I was up too late, wasn&#39;t thinking real straight,I started working on a motion.And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.And I started working on this motion,and the head of the motion was: &quot;Motion to try my poor,14-year-old black male clientlike a privileged, white 75-year-oldcorporate executive.&quot;

zh-cn:在这个提案里我说检察院，警察局和法庭都处理不当说这个法院没有合情合法这一说之类的疯话全是故意乱判第二天早上我醒来回想，我是做了个梦呢还是真的写了这个提案？恐怖的是，不光我真写了我还寄给法院了
en:And I put in my motionthat there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.There was a crazy line in there about how there&#39;s no conduct in this county,it&#39;s all misconduct.And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion,or did I actually write it?And to my horror, not only had I written it,but I had sent it to court.

zh-cn:几个月过去了我全忘了有这么回事最后我决定天哪，我得上庭去做这个案子我跳上车觉得很紧张——非常紧张我上车开到法庭我在想，这将会是场硬仗，会很痛苦最后我终于钻出车子，开始往法庭走
en:A couple months went by,and I had just forgotten all about it.And I finally decided,oh gosh, I&#39;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case.And I got into my carand I was feeling really overwhelmed — overwhelmed.And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful.And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse.

zh-cn:当我上台阶时有个上了年纪的黑人老伯，法院的清洁工他看见我，跑来说他问：“你是谁？”我说：“我是律师。”他说：“你，是律师？”我说：“是的。先生。”这个老伯凑过来给了我一个拥抱他悄悄在我耳边说他说：“我真为你骄傲。”我得和大家承认这可给了我一针强心剂他的话提醒了我心深处我的自我定位提醒了我每个人都应该对社会，对更好的前景做出的贡献
en:And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse,there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.When this man saw me, he came over to meand he said, &quot;Who are you?&quot;I said, &quot;I&#39;m a lawyer.&quot; He said, &quot;You&#39;re a lawyer?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;And this man came over to meand he hugged me.And he whispered in my ear.He said, &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you.&quot;And I have to tell you,it was energizing.It connected deeply with something in meabout identity,about the capacity of every person to contributeto a community, to a perspective that is hopeful.

zh-cn:所以我跑到法庭里我一走进去，法官看见我就说：“史蒂文森先生，是你写了这个疯案么？”我说：“是先生，是我写的。”我们开始争论人们陆续跑进来，因为大家都愤怒了我的确写了不少挺够劲的事情警察也进来了助理检察官也进来了，书记员也进来了我还没回过神来，整个法庭站满了人全很愤怒，因为我们在谈种族问题我们在谈贫穷我们在谈不平等待遇
en:Well I went into the courtroom.And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.He said, &quot;Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?&quot;I said, &quot;Yes, sir. I did.&quot; And we started arguing.And people started coming in because they were just outraged.I had written these crazy things.And police officers were coming inand assistant prosecutors and clerk workers.And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with peopleangry that we were talking about race,that we were talking about poverty,that we were talking about inequality.

zh-cn:我眼角瞟到那个清洁工，在外面走来走去不断向里张望，他也都能听到人们的抱怨他就这样来回来去地走最后，这个黑人老伯进来了一脸担心地坐在我后面几乎顶到了辩护台十分钟后，法官提议休息一下休息期间，一个副警长觉得清洁工进法庭有失面子这个副警长跳起来，向这个老伯冲过去说：“吉米，你来法庭里干什么？”这个老黑人站起来看看这个副警长，看看我他说：“我进来是想告诉这个年轻人往前看，往好了看，挺住。”
en:And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth.And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler.He kept pacing back and forth.And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his facecame into the courtroom and sat down behind me,almost at counsel table.About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offendedthat the janitor had come into court.And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.He said, &quot;Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?&quot;And this older black man stood upand he looked at that deputy and he looked at meand he said, &quot;I came into this courtroomto tell this young man,keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.&quot;

zh-cn:我今天来TED是因为我相信这里很多人都明白这个世界的道德的弧线尽管很长但是永远向着公正的一边倾斜在我们开始关心人权和尊严之前我们无法真正完成进化我们的生存和每一个人的生存都分不开我们在科技和设计上的前景在娱乐和创造力上的眼光必须与人性，慈善，和公正的远见相结合最重要的是对于每个执着此见的人我只想和你说往前看，往好了看，挺住
en:I&#39;ve come to TEDbecause I believe that many of you understandthat the moral arc of the universe is long,but it bends toward justice.That we cannot be full evolved human beingsuntil we care about human rights and basic dignity.That all of our survivalis tied to the survival of everyone.That our visions of technology and designand entertainment and creativityhave to be married with visionsof humanity, compassion and justice.And more than anything,for those of you who share that,I&#39;ve simply come to tell youto keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.

zh-cn:布莱恩：有很多机会比如，如果你在加州住今年春天有个公投将是个很大的工夫关于重新分配我们在惩戒人上花的钱比如，在加州在未来五年内我们将花掉一亿美元——一亿呀同时，百分之四十六的凶杀案都没有下落百分之五十六的强奸案，查不出来这个公投是个改变现状的机会这个公投将提出把这些钱花在执法和保安上我认为这个机会我们能帮忙
en:BS: Well there are opportunities all around us.If you live in the state of California, for example,there&#39;s a referendum coming up this springwhere actually there&#39;s going to be an effortto redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.For example, here in Californiawe&#39;re going to spend one billion dollarson the death penalty in the next five years —one billion dollars.And yet, 46 percent of all homicide casesdon&#39;t result in arrest.56 percent of all rape cases don&#39;t result.So there&#39;s an opportunity to change that.And this referendum would propose having those dollarsgo to law enforcement and safety.And I think that opportunity exists all around us.

zh-cn:克瑞斯：在近三十年美国的犯罪率有个大下降有人说部分原因是和大幅上升的监禁率有关你对持这个说法的人会怎么讲？
en:CA: There&#39;s been this huge declinein crime in America over the last three decades.And part of the narrative of thatis sometimes that it&#39;s about increased incarceration rates.What would you say to someone who believed that?
时间：22:26
zh-cn:布莱恩：其实犯罪率几乎没怎么变这个国家上升的监禁率并不是在暴力犯罪这一类里的而是由毒品的滥用所导致的这才是我们监狱人口上升的主要原因我们在花哨的惩戒上走得有点太远了同时我们有三击出局的规定能把一些人永久监禁起来只是因为偷了辆自行车，或者一点点财物我们并不给他们机会对受害人作出补偿我相信我们需要给犯罪的人更多帮助而不是剥夺他们仅有的我想现今的刑法哲学对谁也没有利我认为这个大方向应该改变
en:BS: Well actually the violent crime ratehas remained relatively stable.The great increase in mass incarceration in this countrywasn&#39;t really in violent crime categories.It was this misguided war on drugs.That&#39;s where the dramatic increases have comein our prison population.And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.And so we have three strikes lawsthat put people in prison foreverfor stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,rather than making them give those resources backto the people who they victimized.I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,not do less.And I think our current punishment philosophydoes nothing for no one.And I think that&#39;s the orientation that we have to change.
