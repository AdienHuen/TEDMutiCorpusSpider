zh-cn:开头是这样这引出一个存在性问题那就是，如果我亲身经历并对此有完整的意识的话为什么我不在照片上以及这是何时何地？这是加利福尼亚的洛杉矶，我所住的地方这是张警方的照片，那是我的车我们离洛杉矶最大的一家医院不到一里路那家医院是西德斯西奈医院那时的情形是一辆满载着从医院下班的医护人员的车碰上了事故现场他们通知警方车内没有幸存者司机死了，我也是那时警方正在等消防车过来切割车身好搬出司机的尸体当他们作业时发现了玻璃后的我－头骨和锁骨都已经撞断除了两根肋骨盆骨和两个胳膊我已经粉身碎骨，但仍有脉搏他们带我到了附近那家医院西德斯西奈医院因为内出血，那晚我输了45单位的血液－这意味着得全部换血－才保证了我有稳定的血液量我被接上呼吸机有严重中风大脑陷入昏迷
en:This is where it began.And it raises an existential question,which is, if I&#39;m having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness,why am I not visible in the photograph,and where is this time and place?This is Los Angeles, California, where I live.This is a police photo. That&#39;s actually my car.We&#39;re less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles,called Cedars-Sinai.And the situation is that a car full of paramedicson their way home from the hospital after workhave run across the wreckage,and they&#39;ve advised the policethat there were no survivors inside the car,that the driver&#39;s dead, that I&#39;m dead.And the police are waiting for the fire department to arriveto cut apart the vehicleto extract the body of the driver.And when they do, they find that behind the glass,they find me.And my skull&#39;s crushed and my collar bone is crushed;all but two of my ribs,my pelvis and both arms —they&#39;re all crushed, but there is still a pulse.And they get me to that nearby hospital,Cedars-Sinai,where that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding,45 units of blood —which means full replacements of all the blood in me —before they&#39;re able to staunch the flow.I&#39;m put on full life support,and I have a massive stroke,and my brain drops into a coma.

zh-cn:昏迷(程度)按照15到3来衡量15是轻度昏迷 3是最深度的只有一种方法能得3分基本就是表面看来没有任何生命迹象我有一个多月处于格拉斯哥三度昏迷中在最深度的昏迷中我在生死间徘徊我体验到与内心世界的完全联接和全部意识
en:Now comas are measuredon a scale from 15 down to three.Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.And if you look, you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s only one way you can score three.It&#39;s essentially there&#39;s no sign of lifefrom outside at all.I spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three,and it is inside that deepest level of coma,on the rim between my life and my death,that I&#39;m experiencing the full connection and full consciousnessof inner space.

en:From my family looking in from outside,what they&#39;re trying to figure outis a different kind of existential question,which is, how far is it going to be possible to bridgefrom the comatose potential mind that they&#39;re looking atto an actual mind,which I define simplyas the functioning of the brainthat is remaining inside my head.Now to put this into a broader context,I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alienwatching the Earth from outer space,and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite televisionis the Earth channel,and your favorite show is the Human Show.And the reason I think it would be so interesting to youis because consciousness is so interesting.It&#39;s so unpredictableand so fragile.

en:And this is how we began.We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.The show began with tremendous special effects,because there were catastrophic climate shifts —which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.Because of the Earth tilting on its axisand those catastrophic climate shifts,we had to figure out how to find better food,and we had to learn — there&#39;s Lucy; that&#39;s how we all began —we had to learn how to crack open animal bones,use tools to do that, to feed on the marrow,to grow our brains more.So we actually grew our consciousnessin response to this global threat.

en:Now you also continue to watchas consciousness evolved to the pointthat here in India, in Madhya Pradesh,there&#39;s one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found.It&#39;s a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create,and it&#39;s the first known expression of arton the planet.And the reason it connects us with consciousness todayis that all of us still today,the very first shape we draw as a childis a circle.And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.We create an eye —and the eye that evolves through all of our history.There&#39;s the Egyptian god Horus,which symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.And that comes down right way to the presentwith the dollar bill in the United States,which has on it an eye of providence.

zh-cn:因此从外太空看这一切你觉得我们明白这个蓝色星球上最珍贵的资源是我们的意识因为这我们画的第一个图案我们的周围都是它的形象它可能是在这个星球上最常見的形象但我们并没有理解 我们认为意识是理所当然的在洛杉矶的时候我从来没有想过这个问题直到它被夺走了我从这件事和康复过程中学到的是这个星球上意识正受到前所未有的威胁这只是些例子
en:So watching all of this show from outer space,you think we get it, we understandthat the most precious resource on the blue planetis our consciousness.Because it&#39;s the first thing we draw;we surround ourselves with images of it;it&#39;s probably the most common image on the planet.But we don&#39;t. We take our consciousness for granted.While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.Until it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.And what I&#39;ve learned since that eventand during my recoveryis that consciousness is under threat on this planetin ways it&#39;s never been under threat before.These are just some examples.

en:And the reason I&#39;m so honored to be hereto talk today in Indiais because India has the sad distinctionof being the head injury capital of the world.That statistic is so sad.There is no more drastic and sudden gap createdbetween potential and actual mindthan a severe head injury.Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation,which means that India, unless something changes,is accumulating a needfor millennia of rehabilitation.What you find in the United Statesis an injury every 20 seconds — that&#39;s one and a half million every year —stroke every 40 seconds,Alzheimer&#39;s disease, every 70 seconds somebody succumbs to that.All of these represent gapsbetween potential mind and actual mind.

en:But let&#39;s swivel around and look at me frontally.This is now flash-forward to the point in timewhere I&#39;ve been discharged by the health system.Look into those eyes. I&#39;m not able to focus those eyes.I&#39;m not able to follow a line of text in a book.But the system has moved me onbecause, as my family started to discover,there is no long-term conceptin the health care system.Neurological damage, 10 years of rehab,requires a long-term perspective.

zh-cn:所以我的康复经历我想从四个方面来与人们分享它－我称之为意识4C－它们帮助我发展我的潜在意识直到我每天使用的实际意识第一个是认知训练跟那些被砸碎的车玻璃不一样大脑的可塑性意味着通过训来治疗的可能性从而恢复和提高自觉和意识水平可塑性就是理智的希望永远存在－是我们重建功能的希望的确，意识能够重新定义自身70年的哈根和西瓦两位专家就证明了在全球高达百分之三十的在学儿童有无法自我纠正的学习能力缺陷但通过适当治疗可以对他们进行筛选，检查和纠正以避免学业的失败但我发现几乎没有人提供这样的治疗或关注
en:So from this experience of my recovery,I want to share four particular aspects —I call them the four C&#39;s of consciousness —that helped me grow my potential mindback towards the actual mind that I work with every day.The first C is cognitive training.Unlike the smashed glass of my car,plasticity of the brainmeans that there was always a possibility, with treatment,to train the brainso that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness.Plasticity means that there was alwayshope for our reason —hope for our ability to rebuild that function.Indeed, the mind can redefine itself,and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silvaback in the 1970&#39;s.The global perspectiveis that up to 30 percent of children in schoolhave learning weaknessesthat are not self-correcting,but with appropriate treatment,they can be screened for and detected and correctedand avoid their academic failure.But what I discovered is it&#39;s almost impossible to find anyonewho provides that treatment or care.

en:Here&#39;s what my neuropsychologist provided for mewhen I actually found somebody who could apply it.I&#39;m not a doctor, so I&#39;m not going to talk about the various subtests.Let&#39;s just talk about full-scale I.Q.Full-scale I.Q. is the mental processing —how fast you can acquire information,retain it and retrieve it —that is essential for success in life today.And you can see here there are three columns.Untestable — that&#39;s when I&#39;m in my coma.And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79,which is just below average.In the health care system, if you touch average, you&#39;re done.That&#39;s when I was discharged from the system.What does average I.Q. really mean?It meant that when I was given two and a half hoursto take a test that anyone herewould take in 50 minutes,I might score an F.This is a very, very low levelin order to be kicked out of the health care system.Then I underwent cognitive training.And let me show you what happened to the right-hand columnwhen I did my cognitive training over a period of time.This is not supposed to occur.I.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidifyat the age of eight.

en:The answer is yes, and for the first time,it&#39;s my pleasure to be able to share two examples.Here&#39;s somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive trainingat ages seven and 11.And here&#39;s another person in, call it, high school and college.And this person is particularly interesting.I won&#39;t go into the intrascatter that&#39;s in the subtests,but they still had a neurologic issue.But that person could be identifiedas having a learning disability.And with accommodation, they went on to collegeand had a full life in terms of their opportunities.

zh-cn:第二方面：（颅颌紊乱）我仍然有很剧烈的偏头痛我了解到我身上的两个原因第一百分之九十是由肌肉和骨骼不吻合引起的头部和颈部疼痛颅骨下颌骨系统是疼痛的重要原因当我经受疼痛发现了解决方案这是牙齿和颞颌关节的相关位置高达百分之三十的人口由于下巴的紊乱，疾病或功能障碍而影响健康我很幸运找到了一个牙医他用上了你能看到的所有技术来做下颚重建头痛的麻烦解决了但我的牙位置不正然后他把我的下巴固定到正确位置重新矫正了牙的位置所以，我的牙居然固定我的下巴的正确位置上这影响了我整个身体
en:Second aspect:I still had crushing migraine headaches.Two elements that worked for me hereare — the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck painis through muscular-skeletal imbalance.The craniomandibular system is critical to that.And when I underwent it and found solutions,this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth.Up to 30 percent of the populationhave a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jawthat affects the entire body.I was fortunate to find a dentistwho applied this entire universeof technology you&#39;re about to seeto establish that if he repositioned my jaw,the headaches pretty much resolved,but that then my teeth weren&#39;t in the right place.He then held my jaw in the right positionwhile orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position.This affected my entire body.

zh-cn:接下来解决的问题是如果百分之九十的头部和颈部头痛是失衡造成剩下的百分之十大部分就是－不考虑动脉瘤，脑肿瘤和激素问题的话－就是循环试想一下，血液流经身体－在加州大学洛杉矶分校医学中心我获知－它是一个封闭的系统有一个血液流动的大管道周围是神经从血液里吸取养分基本就是如此如果在一个封闭系统的软管上摁某处另一个地方就会鼓起如果鼓起的地方是在你身体里最大的神经上，大脑上那就是血管偏头痛这种痛苦的程度只有其他身患血管偏头痛的人才知道利用这种三维投射技术这是磁共振成像, 磁共振血管摄影, MRV,一個有体积的磁共振成像利用这种技术，加州大学洛杉矶分校医学中心的专家能找到这个软管被压的位置一名血管外科医生移除了两侧第一根肋骨的大部分在接下来的几个月和几年里我感受到神经里流淌的生命活力重新回来了
en:The next issue that resolvedwas that, if 90 percent of head and neck painis caused by imbalance,the other 10 percent, largely —if you set aside aneurysms, brain cancerand hormonal issues —is the circulation.Imagine the blood flowing through your body —I was told at UCLA Medical Center —as one sealed system.There&#39;s a big pipe with the blood flowing through it,and around that pipe are the nervesdrawing their nutrient supply from the blood.That&#39;s basically it.If you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system,it bulges someplace else.If that some place else where it bulgesis inside the biggest nerve in your body, your brain,you get a vascular migraine.This is a level of pain that&#39;s only knownto other people who suffer vascular migraines.Using this technology,this is mapping in three dimensions.This is an MRI MRA MRV,a volumetric MRI.Using this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Centerwere able to identifywhere that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.A vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body.And in the following months and years,I felt the neurological flow of life itself returning.

en:Where does it go inside the body?It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-freefor over 80 years.So it goes in and it stays there.Here are the implantation sites.The concept that they&#39;re working towards — and they have working prototypes —is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the bodywhere they&#39;re needed.The main unit will then go inside the brain.An FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex,will send signals in real timeto the motor points in the relevant musclesso that the person will be able to move their arm, let&#39;s say, in real time,if they&#39;ve lost control of their arm.And other FM devices implanted in fingertips,on contacting a surface,will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain,so that the person feels a sense of touch.Is this science fiction? No,because I&#39;m wearing the first application of this technology.I don&#39;t have the ability to control my left foot.A radio device is controlling every step I take,and a sensor picks up my foot for meevery time I walk.

en:And in closing, I want to sharethe personal reason why this meant so much to meand changed the direction of my life.In my coma, one of the presences I sensedwas someone I felt was a protector.And when I came out of my coma, I recognized my family,but I didn&#39;t remember my own past.Gradually, I remembered the protector was my wife.And I whispered the good newsthrough my broken jaw, which was wired shut,to my night nurse.And the following morning, my mother came to explainthat I&#39;d not always been in this bed, in this room,that I&#39;d been working in film and televisionand that I had been in a crashand that, yes, I was married,but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash.And during my time in coma,she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix.Now in the dark years that followed, I had to work out what remained for meif everything that made today special was gone.And as I discovered these threats to consciousnessand how they are surrounding the worldand enveloping the lives of more and more people every day,I discovered what truly remained.I believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness,that the Human Show can stay on the airfor millennia to come.I believe that we can all rise and shine.

zh-cn:西蒙･路易斯：我知道演讲的时候没有时间将这个了－这个就是控制装置这个纪录我走的每一步大概已经五六年了如果我这么做麦克风可能收不到音一声后两声响就是开关打开了再按一次，会响三下也就是准备好了可是开始了它是我的朋友，每晚要充电它很好用我很像补充点刚刚没来得及讲的
en:Simon Lewis: I knew when I was timing thisthat there wouldn&#39;t be time for me to do anything about —Well this is it. This is the control unit.And this records every single step I&#39;ve takenfor, ooh, five or six years now.And if I do this, probably the mic won&#39;t hear it.That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on.When I press it again, it&#39;ll chirp three times,and that&#39;ll mean that it&#39;s armed and ready to go.And that&#39;s my friend. I mean, I charge it every night.And it works. It works.And what I would love to add because I didn&#39;t have time ...

zh-cn:它是做什么的？你们可以看到这儿这儿 如果摄像机能拍到的话这是个小天线我脚跟下是个传感器能监测到我的脚离开地面－就是脚跟抬起这个东西在闪 我拿出来这样你们能看见这个会一直闪烁 它在发送实时信号如果我走得快它检测到的时间间隔就是每次脚跟抬起的间隔就会加快刺激的数量和水平他们做过其他工作－我没有时间谈了－就是他们帮助了成千上万个失聪人士
en:What does it do? Well actually, I&#39;ll show you down here.This down here, if the camera can see that,that is a small antenna.Underneath my heel, there is a sensorthat detects when my foot leaves the ground —what&#39;s called the heel lift.This thing blinks all the time; I&#39;ll leave it out, so you might be able to see it.But this is blinking all the time. It&#39;s sending signals in real time.And if you walk faster, if I walk faster,it detects what&#39;s called the time interval,which is the interval between each heel lift.And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation.The other things they&#39;ve worked on — I didn&#39;t have time to say this in my talk —is they&#39;ve restored functional hearingto thousands of deaf people.

zh-cn:我可以告诉你们：这本来是个将被废弃的技术阿尔夫雷德･曼恩碰到了这位即将退休的医生辛德勒医生他即将退休－所有的技术都将丢失没有一个医疗制造商愿意接手因为这是个小市场但世界上有上百万的失聪人士现在人工耳蜗帮助了他们恢复听力很有用他们正在努力为失明人士开发人工视网膜这是一个可植入的世代因为我还没在演讲中提到植入是在骨骼外我要澄清这点第一代是骨骼外植入所以缠在受用肢体上但我得说，他们很厉害那个楼里有上百人工作－工程师，科学家和其他团队成员－一直在工作
en:I could tell you the story: this was going to be an abandoned technology,but Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire,[Dr. Schindler.]And he was going to retire — all the technology was going to be lost,because not a single medical manufacturer would take it onbecause it was a small issue.But there&#39;s millions of deaf people in the world,and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.It works.And the other thing is they&#39;re working on artificial retinas for the blind.And this, this is the implantable generation.Because what I didn&#39;t say in my talkis this is actually exoskeletal.I should clarify that.Because the first generation is exoskeletal,it&#39;s wrapped around the leg,around the affected limb.I must tell you, they&#39;re an amazing —there&#39;s a hundred people who work in that building —engineers, scientists,and other team members — all the time.

zh-cn:阿尔夫雷德･曼恩建立了这个基金一促进该研究因为他看到没有人愿意在这个项目上注入投资目标人群太小了你想说，世上有很多瘫痪的人但是目标人群太小而大量的研究和时间FDA 的许可证投资回报期太长风投者没有兴趣因此他看到了他插手此事的必要他是一个了不起的人研发了很多尖端技术
en:Alfred Mann has set up this foundationto advance this researchbecause he sawthere&#39;s no way venture capital would come in for something like this.The audience is too small.You&#39;d think, there&#39;s plenty of paralyzed people in the world,but the audience is too small,and the amount of research, the time it takes,the FDA clearances,the payback time is too longfor V.C. to be interested.So he saw a need and he stepped in.He&#39;s a very, very remarkable man.He&#39;s done a lot of very cutting-edge science.
