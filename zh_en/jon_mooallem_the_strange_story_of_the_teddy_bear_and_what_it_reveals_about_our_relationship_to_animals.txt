zh-cn:1902年的秋天西奥多·罗斯福总统需要一个暂别白宫的小假期于是他坐火车去了密西西比在一个镇外狩猎黑熊这个镇叫斯密德思在打猎的第一天他们没有看到熊大家都觉得很无奈然而第二天 猎犬在很长的追逐后把一只熊逼进角落但在那个时候总统已经放弃了追逐并回到营帐吃午餐于是他的狩猎指导敲昏了动物用他步枪的尾部去敲击熊头顶然后把它绑在一棵树上随后吹着号角嘟嘟地走了他想让罗斯福回来时享受射击的乐趣这是一只母熊它有些迷糊 也受了伤体重严重不足 看起来脏脏的当罗斯福看到这个动物被绑在树上时他实在不忍心朝它开枪他觉得这样做会违反他的行为准则和运动员精神
en:So it was the fall of 1902,and President Theodore Rooseveltneeded a little break from the White House,so he took a train to Mississippito do a little black bear hunting outside of a towncalled Smedes.The first day of the hunt,they didn&#39;t see a single bear,so it was a big bummer for everyone,but the second day, the dogs cornered oneafter a really long chase, but by that point,the president had given upand gone back to camp for lunch,so his hunting guide cracked the animalon the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,and then tied it up to a treeand started tooting away on his bugleto call Roosevelt back so he could have the honorof shooting it.The bear was a female.It was dazed, injured,severely underweight, a little mangy-looking,and when Roosevelt saw this animaltied up to the tree,he just couldn&#39;t bring himself to fire at it.He felt like that would go against his codeas a sportsman.

zh-cn:几天后 这个情景被记录了下来出现在华盛顿的一个政治卡通中它叫做《在密西西比划清底线》画面展现了罗斯福放下了他的枪同时伸出他的手臂给熊留了一条生路这只熊坐在它的后腿上两只大眼睛 睁得圆圆的 充满了恐惧它的耳朵竖在头顶上它看起来很无助 你恨不得想把它拥入怀中让它不要担心在那时它看起来不太眼熟但如果你现在看这个卡通你能马上认出这个动物：它就是泰迪熊这就是泰迪熊诞生的故事简单说 玩具制造商将这个卡通中的熊做成了毛绒玩具 并用罗斯福总统的名字给它命了名：泰迪熊
en:A few days later, the scene was memorializedin a political cartoon back in Washington.It was called &quot;Drawing a Line in Mississippi,&quot;and it showed Roosevelt withhis gun down and his arm out,sparing the bear&#39;s life,and the bear was sitting on its hind legswith these two big, frightened, wide eyesand little ears pricked up at the top of its head.It looked really helpless, like you just wanted tosweep it up into your armsand reassure it.It wouldn&#39;t have looked familiar at the time,but if you go looking for the cartoon now,you recognize the animal right away:It&#39;s a teddy bear.And this is how the teddy bear was born.Essentially, toymakers tookthe bear from the cartoon,turned it into a plush toy, and then named itafter President Roosevelt — Teddy&#39;s bear.

zh-cn:我觉得自己有点傻我站在这个舞台上并决定用我的时间来告诉你们一个一百年前的故事关于一个软绵绵的儿童玩具的发明但我想说在泰迪熊的发明的故事里有个更重要的故事这个故事关系到我们对自然的想法可以如此戏剧化的变化这也关系到此时在这个星球上我们所讲述的故事正戏剧化地改变自然
en:And I do feel a little ridiculousthat I&#39;m up here on this stageand I&#39;m choosing to use my timeto tell you about a 100-year-old storyabout the invention of a squishy kid&#39;s toy,but I&#39;d argue that the invention of the teddy bear,inside that story is a more important story,a story about how dramatically our ideasabout nature can change,and also about how, on the planet right now,the stories that we tellare dramatically changing nature.

zh-cn:您想想泰迪熊对于我们来说它像一个自然的产物因为熊那么可爱 让人忍不住想抱谁不想自己的孩子跟其玩耍呢？而在1902年熊并不那么可爱 也不让人想拥抱我是说他们看起来一样可是当时没人这么看待他们在1902年熊是野兽熊当时是让孩子们异常害怕的动物对几代人来说熊一直象征着所有人们在前线遇到的危险联邦政府其实曾经系统性地灭绝狗熊以及其它捕食动物比如说小狼和野狼这些动物当时被妖魔化它们被称为杀人犯因为它们杀害人们的家禽一个政府生物学家解释说针对动物的战争 比如说熊是因为在我们日益发展的文明中它们不再有一席之地所以我们将它们清除掉在十年之间 将近50万只狼被屠杀在95％的原本属于灰熊的领地上灰熊也濒临绝境在那些曾经一时有3千万野牛穿越的平原上你会听说这样的事儿：一些火车必须停靠四到五个小时才能让这群黑压压、活生生的动物如潮水一般穿过轨道到1902年 这里只剩下不到100只野牛存活于野外所以我想说的是 泰迪熊诞生于一个异常严峻的灭绝时代你可以把它看成一个征兆也许有些人从心底开始对这些屠杀感到矛盾美国始终痛恨熊 也害怕它但突然间 美国也想要给熊一个大拥抱
en:Because think about the teddy bear.For us, in retrospect, it feels like an obvious fit,because bears are so cute and cuddly,and who wouldn&#39;t want to giveone to their kids to play with,but the truth is that in 1902,bears weren&#39;t cute and cuddly.I mean, they looked the same,but no one thought of them that way.In 1902, bears were monsters.Bears were something that frickin&#39; terrified kids.For generations at that point,the bear had been a shorthand for all the dangerthat people were encountering on the frontier,and the federal government was actuallysystematically exterminating bearsand lots of other predators too,like coyotes and wolves.These animals, they were being demonized.They were called murderersbecause they killed people&#39;s livestock.One government biologist, he explained thiswar on animals like the bear by sayingthat they no longer had a placein our advancing civilization,and so we were just clearing them out of the way.In one 10-year period, close to half a million wolveshad been slaughtered.The grizzly would soon be wiped outfrom 95 percent of its original territory,and whereas once there had been 30 million bisonmoving across the plains, and you would havethese stories of trains having to stopfor four or five hours so that these thick,living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks,now, by 1902, there were maybe less than 100 left in the wild.And so what I&#39;m saying is, the teddy bear was borninto the middle of this great spasm of extermination,and you can see it as a sign thatmaybe some people deep downwere starting to feel conflicted about all that killing.America still hated the bear and feared it,but all of a sudden, America also wantedto give the bear a great big hug.

zh-cn:这是我在过去几年来很好奇的事我们如何想像动物我们如何思考和感受它们它们的名声如何形成又是如何在我们的头脑里被改写我们生活在一个灭绝风暴迫在眉睫的时代这个星球上一半的生物种类都可能在这个世纪末消失那么为什么我们会关心其中一部分种类 而不是其它的呢社会科学有一个新的领域一个相对新的领域 研究这些问题同时尝试解析人类与动物之间具有神奇力量 却也令人费解的这种关系我花了很多时间来阅读他们的学术期刊我能说的是他们的发现广泛得让人吃惊我最喜欢的一些发现包括一个人在纽约北部看越多的电视他或她就越害怕受到黑熊的攻击如果你给一个美国人看一只老虎他们更可能假设它是母的而不是公的在一个研究中 一条假的蛇和一只假的乌龟被放在路边驾驶者撞击蛇的比例远大于乌龟而在撞击假动物的驾驶者中有3%是故意这么做的相对于男人 女人更有可能在冲浪时看到海豚而有&quot;美妙的感觉&quot;68％具有&quot;强烈的权利和自尊感&quot;的母亲们在观看Purina广告时 [猫粮品牌]能和跳舞的猫能产生同鸣（笑声）美国人觉得龙虾比鸽子更重要但也更加愚蠢野生火鸡被认为比海獭更危险一点点熊猫比瓢虫可爱两倍
en:So this is something that I&#39;ve been reallycurious about in the last few years.How do we imagine animals,how do we think and feel about them,and how do their reputations get writtenand then rewritten in our minds?We&#39;re here living in the eye of a great stormof extinction where half the species on the planetcould be gone by the end of the century,and so why is it that we come to care aboutsome of those species and not others?Well, there&#39;s a new field, a relatively new fieldof social science that started looking atthese questions and trying to unpack the powerfuland sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationshipsthat we have to animals,and I spent a lot of time looking throughtheir academic journals,and all I can really say is that their findingsare astonishingly wide-ranging.So some of my favorites include thatthe more television a personwatches in Upstate New York,the more he or she is afraidof being attacked by a black bear.If you show a tiger to an American,they&#39;re much more likely to assume that it&#39;s femaleand not male.In a study where a fake snakeand a fake turtle were put on the side of the road,drivers hit the snake muchmore often than the turtle,and about three percent ofdrivers who hit the fake animalsseemed to do it on purpose.Women are more likely than men to get a&quot;magical feeling&quot; when they see dolphins in the surf.Sixty-eight percent of mothers with&quot;high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem&quot;identified with the dancing catsin a commercial for Purina. (Laughter)Americans consider lobstersmore important than pigeonsbut also much, much stupider.Wild turkeys are seen as only slightlymore dangerous than sea otters,and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs.

zh-cn:这其中有些是因为外表的关系对吗？我们更同情看起来像我们的动物尤其是那些像人类婴儿的大而朝前的眼睛圆形脸类似不倒翁的姿势这就是为什么如果你收到你在明尼苏达州的姑姑寄来的圣诞卡上面更可能有一只带绒毛的小企鹅而不是冰川湾狼蜘蛛 [笑声]但这也不完全是因为外表 对吧？我们对动物的想法有文化的一面我们讲述关于这些动物的故事这些故事像所有故事一样当我们讲故事的时候用时间和地点给故事塑形所以请想想那个时刻回到1902年 一只凶猛的熊成为一只泰迪熊当时是什么环境？美国正经历城市化历史上第一次 大部分人住到了城市我们与自然的距离日益剧增我们有了一个安全的空间可以重新想象熊 并将其浪漫化于是自然开始显得这么纯粹和可爱因为我们不再害怕你可以看到这个循环不断上演一遍又一遍出现在所有动物身上我们似乎总是这样妖魔化然后灭绝一个物种而当我们快要成功时又开始怜惜弱者展现出无限的同情心我们人类乐于运用自己的力量却又为这能量之大而惶惶不安起来
en:So some of this is physical, right?We tend to sympathize morewith animals that look like us,and especially that resemble human babies,so with big, forward-facing eyesand circular faces,kind of a roly-poly posture.This is why, if you get a Christmas card from, like,your great aunt in Minnesota,there&#39;s usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it,and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider.But it&#39;s not all physical, right?There&#39;s a cultural dimension tohow we think about animals,and we&#39;re telling stories about these animals,and like all stories,they are shaped by the times and the placesin which we&#39;re telling them.So think about that momentback in 1902 again where a ferocious bearbecame a teddy bear.What was the context?Well, America was urbanizing.For the first time, nearly amajority of people lived in cities,so there was a growing distancebetween us and nature.There was a safe space where we couldreconsider the bear and romanticize it.Nature could only start toseem this pure and adorablebecause we didn&#39;t have to be afraid of it anymore.And you can see that cycle playing outagain and again with all kinds of animals.It seems like we&#39;re always stuck betweendemonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out,and then when we get very close to doing that,empathizing with it as an underdogand wanting to show it compassion.So we exert our power,but then we&#39;re unsettledby how powerful we are.

zh-cn:举个例子 这是几千封信件和图画之一这是孩子们寄给布什政府请求政府遵循《濒危动物保护法案》保护北极熊这些信是在2000至2010年寄出的当时我们对气候变化的关注剧增我们一直看到这样一个画面一只北极熊被困在一小块冰上看起来非常惆怅我花了很多天看这些文件我非常喜欢它们 这张是我的最爱您可以看到这是只被淹没的北极熊与此同时它正被一只龙虾和鲨鱼吃掉这个来自于叫一个叫弗利兹的孩子他实际上已经找到对付气候变化方法在乙醇的基础上他研究出了方案他说 &quot;我为北极熊感到难过我喜欢北极熊大家可以用玉米汁来开车 -弗利兹&quot;200年前 极地探险家会记载说北极熊跳到他们的船上尝试活吞他们即使他们在熊身上点火然而这些孩子们不这么看北极熊实际上他们看待北极熊的角度也不同于我在80年代的看法我们认为这些动物是北极神秘而恐怖的主人然而你看现在气候快速地变化这已经颠倒了我们对动物的看法它们从嗜血的杀人犯变成了纤弱垂死的受害者如果你仔细想想这也算泰迪熊的故事的一个结论因为在那时 美国或多或少征服了属于它的领地我们当时正接近消灭这些最后的野外捕食者现在 社会的影响已经扩大一路通往世界的最顶端这使那些甚至最遥远世界上最凶猛的熊看起来也像可爱的和无辜的受害者
en:So for example, this is one ofprobably thousands of letters and drawingsthat kids sent to the Bush administration,begging it to protect the polar bearunder the Endangered Species Act,and these were sent back in the mid-2000s,when awareness of climatechange was suddenly surging.We kept seeing that image of a polar bearstranded on a little ice floelooking really morose.I spent days looking through these files.I really love them. This one&#39;s my favorite.If you can see, it&#39;s a polar bear that&#39;s drowningand then it&#39;s also being eaten simultaneouslyby a lobster and a shark.This one came from a kid named Fritz,and he&#39;s actually got a solution to climate change.He&#39;s got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution.He says, &quot;I feel bad about the polar bears.I like polar bears.Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz.&quot;So 200 years ago, you would have Arctic explorerswriting about polar bears leaping into their boatsand trying to devour them,even if they lit the bear on fire,but these kids don&#39;t see the polar bear that way,and actually they don&#39;t even see the polar bearthe way that I did back in the &#39;80s.I mean, we thought of these animalsas mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic.But look now how quickly that climate changehas flipped the image of the animal in our minds.It&#39;s gone from that bloodthirsty man-killerto this delicate, drowning victim,and when you think about it, that&#39;s kind ofthe conclusion to the storythat the teddy bear started telling back in 1902,because back then, America had more or lessconquered its share of the continent.We were just getting around topolishing off these last wild predators.Now, society&#39;s reach has expandedall the way to the top of the world,and it&#39;s made even these, the most remote,the most powerful bears on the planet,seem like adorable and blameless victims.

zh-cn:其实 泰迪熊故事还有一个不为人知的后记我想讲给大家听因为即使没有过多久在1902年罗斯福打猎之后这个玩具成为完全的热潮大多数人认为它只是一时流行它只是一种无聊的政治新奇物品在总统退职后就会消失所以在1909年 当罗斯福的后任威廉·霍华德·塔夫脱准备任职玩具界开始寻找下一个流行产品他们没有成功
en:But you know, there&#39;s also apostscript to the teddy bear storythat not a lot of people talk about.We&#39;re going to talk about it,because even though it didn&#39;t really take longafter Roosevelt&#39;s hunt in 1902for the toy to become a full-blown craze,most people figured it was a fad,it was a sort of silly political novelty itemand it would go away once the president left office,and so by 1909, when Roosevelt&#39;s successor,William Howard Taft,was getting ready to be inaugurated,the toy industry was on the huntfor the next big thing.They didn&#39;t do too well.

zh-cn:在那年一月份 塔夫脱作为嘉宾参加在亚特兰大的一个舞会在这之前的几天来最大的新闻就是菜单他们打算为他准备一道特别而美味的南方菜肴叫做红薯烤负鼠一整只负鼠放在一堆红薯上烤有时候他们会把大尾巴留在上面就好像一根宽面条放在塔夫特桌上的那只重达18磅在晚宴结束后 乐团开始演奏客人们开始唱歌突然间塔夫特惊讶地收到一份礼物来自于一群当地的支持者那是一个填充的负鼠玩具珠状眼睛和光秃秃的耳朵这是他们推荐的新产品作为威廉·塔夫特担任总统的答案呼应泰迪·罗斯福的泰迪熊他们称它为&quot;比利负鼠&quot;24小时之内 乔治比利负鼠公司成立并开始运营在全国进行中介交易当时洛杉矶时报非常自信地宣称 &quot;泰迪熊已经退到后幕在将来的四年 甚至八年美国的儿童将和比利负鼠一起玩耍”从那时起 负鼠的流行具备了条件有比利负鼠名信片、比利负鼠顶针、比利负鼠奶油罐 喝咖啡的时候用还有更小的比利负鼠 攀在一根棍子上小孩子们可以把它当旗子一样挥动即使借助这些市场营销手段比利负鼠的生命结果还是短暂得可怜这个玩具彻底地失败了到那年的年底它几乎完全地被遗忘了这意味着比利负鼠甚至没有持久到圣诞节你可以想像这对一个玩具来说是个悲催的灾难
en:That January, Taft was the guest of honorat a banquet in Atlanta,and for days in advance,the big news was the menu.They were going to be serving hima Southern specialty, a delicacy, really,called possum and taters.So you would have a whole opossumroasted on a bed of sweet potatoes,and then sometimes they&#39;d leavethe big tail on it like a big, meaty noodle.The one brought to Taft&#39;s tableweighed 18 pounds.So after dinner, the orchestra started to play,and the guests burst into song,and all of a sudden, Taft was surprisedwith the presentation of a giftfrom a group of local supporters,and this was a stuffed opossum toy,all beady-eyed and bald-eared,and it was a new product they were putting forwardto be the William Taft presidency&#39;s answerto Teddy Roosevelt&#39;s teddy bear.They were calling it the &quot;billy possum.&quot;Within 24 hours, the Georgia Billy Possum Companywas up and running, brokering dealsfor these things nationwide,and the Los Angeles Times announced,very confidently, &quot;The teddy bearhas been relegated to a seat in the rear,and for four years, possibly eight,the children of the United Stateswill play with billy possum.&quot;So from that point, there was a fit of opossum fever.There were billy possum postcards, billy possum pins,billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time.There were smaller billy possums on a stickthat kids could wave around like flags.But even with all this marketing,the life of the billy possumturned out to be just pathetically brief.The toy was an absolute flop,and it was almost completely forgottenby the end of the year,and what that means is that the billy possumdidn&#39;t even make it to Christmastime,which when you think about it isa special sort of tragedy for a toy.

zh-cn:对于这个失败 我们有两种解释第一 很明显我就明说吧：负鼠太狰狞了但也许更重要的是比利负鼠的故事完全错了尤其是比起泰迪熊的背景故事大多数人类进化历史让我们觉得熊很厉害的是他们完全独立于我们他们过着与我们平行的生活如同威胁和竞争者当罗斯福在密西西比打猎时这个印象完全被破灭了那个被他绑在树上的动物成为了所有熊的象征这些动物现在是死是活完全取决于人们是给予同情心还是漠然无视这预示了一种不详的熊的未来它也预示了发展中的人类心中的不安如果一个像熊那样的动物的生存现在完全取决于我们那现在 一个世纪以后如果你还关注环境的发展你会感觉到更强烈的不适我们住在一个这样的时代科学家称之为“保护依赖”这意味着我们已经过度的破坏了自然它不能再单纯依靠自我修复了大多数濒临灭绝的种类唯一能生存的条件是人类必须置身野外监控着环境 并把环境改造得利于动物的生存我们必须亲自参与我们永远不能放手不管这个工作量太大了现在我们正在训练秃鹰不在电线上歇脚我们开着小型的超光波飞机领着鹤在冬季移居南方我们给鼬注射瘟疫疫苗我们用无人机器监视侏儒兔我们从试图灭绝一些物种到无限期地 微观地管理许多种类的生存那么有哪些物种呢？那些我们已经说过的在精彩的故事里出现的那些我们决定应该继续存活的保护和驯化之间的界限变得模糊
en:So we can explain that failure two ways.The first, well, it&#39;s pretty obvious.I&#39;m going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway:Opossums are hideous. (Laughter)But maybe more importantly is thatthe story of the billy possum was all wrong,especially comparedto the backstory of the teddy bear.Think about it: for most ofhuman&#39;s evolutionary history,what&#39;s made bears impressive to ushas been their complete independence from us.It&#39;s that they live these parallel livesas menaces and competitors.By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi,that stature was being crushed,and the animal that he had roped to a treereally was a symbol for all bears.Whether those animals lived or died nowwas entirely up to the compassionor the indifference of people.That said something really ominousabout the future of bears,but it also said something very unsettling about who we&#39;d become,if the survival of even an animal like thatwas up to us now.So now, a century later, if you&#39;re at allpaying attention to what&#39;shappening in the environment,you feel that discomfort so much more intensely.We&#39;re living now in an age of what scientistshave started to call &quot;conservation reliance,&quot;and what that term means is that we&#39;ve disruptedso much that nature can&#39;t possiblystand on its own anymore,and most endangered speciesare only going to surviveif we stay out there in the landscaperiggging the world around them in their favor.So we&#39;ve gone hands-onand we can&#39;t ever take our hands off,and that&#39;s a hell of a lot of work.Right now, we&#39;re training condorsnot to perch on power lines.We teach whooping cranesto migrate south for the winterbehind little ultra-light airplanes.We&#39;re out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets.We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones.So we&#39;ve gone from annihilating speciesto micromanaging the survival of a lot of speciesindefinitely, and which ones?Well, the ones that we&#39;ve toldcompelling stories about,the ones we&#39;ve decided ought to stick around.The line between conservation and domesticationis blurred.

zh-cn:所以我一直在讲的是 这些故事这些关于野外动物的故事是很主观的它们可能是非理性的、浪漫化的、或情绪化的有时它们跟事实毫无相关在一个“保护依赖”的世界这些故事会有很真实的后果因为现在 我们对一种动物的看法对它生存的影响大于你在生态课本中读到的任何信息如今讲故事很关键情绪很重要我们的想象已经成为一股生态力量也许泰迪熊营销的成功一部分归功于 这个罗斯福的传说和那只密西西比的熊就好像一个寓言讲述了人类意识到自己对于社会的巨大责任的过程那时还要71年《濒危动物保护法案通过》才会通过但事实上 这是整个社会思潮浓缩成的一个景象就像一副琉璃画熊是个被绑在树上的无辜的受害者而美国总统决定怜惜它谢谢（掌声）[插画：温迪 马克诺顿]
en:So what I&#39;ve been saying is that the storiesthat we tell about wild animals are so subjectivethey can be irrationalor romanticized or sensationalized.Sometimes they just havenothing to do with the facts.But in a world of conservation reliance,those stories have very real consequences,because now, how we feel about an animalaffects its survivalmore than anything that you read aboutin ecology textbooks.Storytelling matters now.Emotion matters.Our imagination has become an ecological force.And so maybe the teddy bear worked in partbecause the legend of Rooseveltand that bear in Mississippiwas kind of like an allegoryof this great responsibility that societywas just beginning to face up to back then.It would be another 71 yearsbefore the Endangered Species Act was passed,but really, here&#39;s its whole ethosboiled down into something like a sceneyou&#39;d see in a stained glass window.The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree,and the president of the United Statesdecided to show it some mercy.Thank you.(Applause)[Illustrations by Wendy MacNaughton]
