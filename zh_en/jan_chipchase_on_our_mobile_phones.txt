zh-cn:我在日本东京居住并工作我致力于人类行为学的调研然后运用我们所学到的知识用不同的方式去看待未来并设计未来坦诚的说，我已经做这行7年了我仍不知道未来将会是怎样但我大致了解人们的行为到了那时候将会是怎样
en:I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.And I specialize in human behavioral research,and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways,and to design for that future.And you know, to be honest, I&#39;ve been doing this for seven years,and I haven&#39;t got a clue what the future is going to be like.But I&#39;ve got a pretty good ideahow people will behave when they get there.

zh-cn:这就是我的办公室，到处都是并不是坐在一个实验室里大多数都在印度，中国，巴西和非洲我们共同生活在这个星球上 -63亿人类其中大约30亿人，在今年年底会接受到手机信号再过2年将会有另10亿人加入他们我要提到这点是因为如果我们要为未来做设计我们需要了解他们是怎么想的这也是我工作的重点也是我们团队的
en:This is my office. It&#39;s out there.It&#39;s not in the lab,and it&#39;s increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.We live on a planet — 6.3 billion people.About three billion people, by the end of this year,will have cellular connectivity.And it&#39;ll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.And I mention this because,if we want to design for that future,we need to figure out what those people are about.And that&#39;s, kind of, where I see what my job isand what our team&#39;s job is.

zh-cn:我们的调研一般由一个比较简单的问题开场比如： 你今天随身带了什么你马上会想到你所拥有的所有财物当你出门的时候你会想今天我要带什么你边找边想些什么我到底要带那些东西呢那些你随身带的东西你会真正的用到呢
en:Our research often starts with a very simple question.So I&#39;ll give you an example. What do you carry?If you think of everything in your life that you own,when you walk out that door,what do you consider to take with you?When you&#39;re looking around, what do you consider?Of that stuff, what do you carry?And of that stuff, what do you actually use?

zh-cn:这是我们感兴趣的地方因为这是意识和潜意识做决定的一个过程仔细想想如果你每天随身带的东西最后都派上了用场那么在精神上，感情上和功能上都有一定的价值坦率的说我们很舍得买一些有价值的东西 不是吗所以关于这个我做了5年的调研观察人们到底随身带些什么我会翻别人的包，摸他们的口袋，还有皮夹我甚至会到世界各地拜访他们的家然后带着摄像机和他们一起到城里转儿这好像是经过批准的跟踪一样我们做这些只是为了找到问题的答案人们到底随身带些什么？
en:So this is interesting to us,because the conscious and subconscious decision processimplies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up usinghas some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.And to put it really bluntly, you know,people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?So I&#39;ve probably done about five years&#39; researchlooking at what people carry.I go in people&#39;s bags. I look in people&#39;s pockets, purses.I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide,and we follow them around town with video cameras.It&#39;s kind of like stalking with permission.And we do all this — and to go back to the original question,what do people carry?

zh-cn:我们发现我们随身带很多东西这个没什么错但当你问及哪3样东西是你每天必须要带的话穿越文化，性别，上下文大多数人会说钥匙，钱手机，如果他们有的话我没说这是个好东西，但是这是个东西是吧？我不能从你手中抢掉你的手机，扔掉如果我那样做的话，你大概会打我一顿或者我这个举动有点太明显了更不用说我是一个手机品牌的在职人员但是这是为什么呢为什么这些物品对我们那么重要呢我们的调研表明，这些物品是可以拯救你生命的拯救我们自己和我们爱的人
en:And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.OK, that&#39;s fair enough.But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are —across cultures and across gender and across contexts —most people will say keys, moneyand, if they own one, a mobile phone.And I&#39;m not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?I mean, I couldn&#39;t take your phones off you if I wanted to.You&#39;d probably kick me out, or something.OK, it might seem like an obvious thingfor someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.But really, the question is, why? Right?So why are these things so important in our lives?And it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival —survival for us and survival for our loved ones.

zh-cn:我们需要一把开启自家大门的钥匙启动车，也需要钥匙。 在美国，这个数据在日益增长钱为了生计可以买食物当然它还有很多别的用途手机其实是一个恢复工具如果你对马斯洛需求层次理论感兴趣的话这3个物品都能给人很好的辅助但他们是马斯洛需求层次理论中排名最后的几位当然他们也有其他别的很多功能但是他们的辅助功能特别突出特别是对手机而言让人们能够超越空间与时间我的意思是你可以通过打个电话来超越距离感或者你也可以根据你个人的情况而定发一个短消息打破时间的约束接受者也可以在他们想看的时候再看大众都普遍偏爱这种交流方式这也是为什么全球有30亿人用手机建立联系的原因他们也为此链接增加了价值
en:So, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth —transport as well, in the U.S. increasingly.Money is useful for buying food, sustenance,among all its other uses.And a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.If you prefer this kind of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs,those three objects are very good at supportingthe lowest rungs in Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs.Yes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff,but they&#39;re very good at this.And in particular, it&#39;s the mobile phone&#39;s abilityto allow people to transcend space and time.And what I mean by that is, you know,you can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience,and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.And this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out,which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.And they value that connectivity.

zh-cn:其实，电脑也可以做这事儿用电话亭也行但是手机它的好处是它非常个性化给你足够的隐私并且很方便你不用得到任何人的允许你就直接一个电话过去了不是吗？这些物品能否救我们的命那还要看你是不是随身带了它们虽然重要，但是我们有时候会忘记我们是人，我们会忘记事情，也算是我们自带功能的一种我觉得这个功能挺好我们会忘记，但是我们适应力很强适应周遭的各种情况当然还有一些方法需要铭记昨天还提到过一个比较简单， 反射效应当你要出门的时候你会转身摸一下自己的口袋就连那些把东西放在皮包的女性朋友们也会做同样的动作你会转身朝屋里看有些人边看还边叫每个人时不时的都会这样
en:But actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.And you can do them with phone kiosks.And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal —and so it also gives you a degree of privacy — and it&#39;s convenient.You don&#39;t need to ask permission from anyone,you can just go ahead and do it, right?However, for these things to help us survive,it depends on them being carried.But — and it&#39;s a pretty big but — we forget.We&#39;re human, that&#39;s what we do. It&#39;s one of our features.I think, quite a nice feature.So we forget, but we&#39;re also adaptable,and we adapt to situations around us pretty well.And so we have these strategies to remember,and one of them was mentioned yesterday.And it&#39;s, quite simply, the point of reflection.And that&#39;s that moment when you&#39;re walking out of a space,and you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.And you turn around, and you look back into the space,and some people talk aloud.And pretty much everyone does it at some point.

zh-cn:再有，大多数人都有一个比较稳定的生活我指的是，他们不用全世界到处跑或总是呆在酒店里每个人都有一个放东西的地方我们称做“重点位置”这个“重心位置”是你专放这些物品的地方刚开始他们可能不是放在那里的但随着时间的推移，他们就在那里扎根了比如你要找某些东西的时候其实 当你转过身朝屋里看的时候你就在找这些物品这些会是你马上去找的地方不是吗所以我们做了调研我们找到了一种100%保证你再也不会忘记东西的方法其实很简单，什么都不要记就可以了，就不会忘记了笑
en:OK, the next thing is — most of you, if you have a stable home life,and what I mean is that you don&#39;t travel all the time, and always in hotels,but most people have what we call a center of gravity.And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.And these things don&#39;t stay in the center of gravity,but over time, they gravitate there.It&#39;s where you expect to find stuff.And in fact, when you&#39;re turning around,and you&#39;re looking inside the house,and you&#39;re looking for this stuff,this is where you look first, right?OK, so when we did this research,we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed wayto never forget anything ever, ever again.And that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.(Laughter)

zh-cn:这听上去是不是有点好笑就是中国的幸运饼？但其实这是一种分配工作的艺术从一个设计的角度来讲关于自身对科技掌握的一种的理解你能分配那些任务给其他人如果你愿意你就可以分配任务给其他人这几乎是解决所有的事的方法除了生理的一些反应，比如去厕所别人不能替你做这些事再有就是娱乐项目你不会叫个人替你去电影院看电影至少目前还不会可能将来我们会这么做
en:OK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?But is, in fact, about the art of delegation.And from a design perspective,it&#39;s about understanding what you can delegate to technologyand what you can delegate to other people.And it turns out, delegation — if you want it to be —can be the solution for pretty much everything,apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.You can&#39;t ask someone to do that on your behalf.And apart from things like entertainment,you wouldn&#39;t pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf,or, at least, not yet.Maybe sometime in the future, we will.

zh-cn:现在让我给你一个现实的分配任务的例子这是可能我最热衷做的事一个我们对文盲的研究他们是用什么来进行交流的2004年U.N的统计数据表明全球有大约有8亿是文盲，不会读也不会写所以我们做了很多调查引起我们注意的是如果你不会读或写但是你想通过距离来进行交流你必须具有能力识别那个与你做交流的人可以是一个电话号码，或者电子邮箱的地址邮政地址很简单的一个问题，如果你不能读或写你怎么搞定自己的联系方式呢？
en:So, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.So this is — probably the thing I&#39;m most passionate aboutis the research that we&#39;ve been doing on illiteracyand how people who are illiterate communicate.So, the U.N. estimated — this is 2004 figures —that there are almost 800 million people who can&#39;t read and write, worldwide.So, we&#39;ve been conducting a lot of research.And one of the things we were looking at is —if you can&#39;t read and write,if you want to communicate over distances,you need to be able to identify the personthat you want to communicate with.It could be a phone number, it could be an e-mail address,it could be a postal address.Simple question: if you can&#39;t read and write,how do you manage your contact information?

zh-cn:事实证明很多人都可以应付的来从设计的角度讲， 我们不能理解他们是怎么做到的这只是举个小小的例子我们是怎么做我们的调研的其实文盲他们是委派任务的高手他们把一个任务中的几个部分委派给其他人那些他们自己做不了的事举个例子这个例子比较复杂这是我们在乌干达做的一个调查关于那里的人们共享并共用一个设备Senta是乌干达的一个土话，意思是 钱它还有一个意思就是把话费当钱寄回去
en:And the fact is that millions of people do it.Just from a design perspective, we didn&#39;t really understand how they did it,and so that&#39;s just one small exampleof the kind of research that we were doing.And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.So they delegate that part of the task process to other people,the stuff that they can&#39;t do themselves.Let me give you another example of delegation.This one&#39;s a little bit more sophisticated,and this is from a study that we did in Ugandaabout how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.Sente is a word in Uganda that means money.It has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime. OK?

zh-cn:是这样运作的比如果，June你在一个边远的村庄我是在坎帕拉的一个工薪阶层我要寄钱回去在你的村庄有个人他有个手机他是共用电话亭的接线员在共用电话亭应该有一个标准功能的手机所以我会去买一个充值卡我不把钱充在我自己的电话里我打电话给你村子的接线员把充值卡上的密码告诉他，让他充到他的手机里也就是说他从坎帕拉冲了值里面的金额冲到了你村庄一名手机用户的账户上你拿10-20%的佣金共用电话亭接线员扣掉10-20%的佣金然后再把多下来的钱以现金的方式给你
en:And it works like this.So let&#39;s say, June, you&#39;re in a village, rural village.I&#39;m in Kampala and I&#39;m the wage earner.I&#39;m sending money back, and it works like this.So, in your village, there&#39;s one person in the village with a phone,and that&#39;s the phone kiosk operator.And it&#39;s quite likely that they&#39;d have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.So what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.And instead of using that money to top up my own phone,I call up the local village operator.And I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.So, they&#39;re topping up the value from Kampala,and it&#39;s now being topped up in the village.You take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you —the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission,and passes the rest over to you in cash.

zh-cn:所以整个过程中有两点我特别喜欢第一，任何能接触到手机的人或拥有手机的人其实就是个自动取款机这带动了这个地方最根本的银行服务虽然没有银行业的基础设施即使他们可以有机会接触到银行银行也不会把他们视为有价值的用户因为他们还不具备拥有银行账户的资格第二点我喜欢的地方抛开我多年调研经验和我们对事物的审美观我无法设计与此一样优雅并与当地的实际情况完全相符的一个系统
en:OK, there&#39;s two things I like about this.So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone —anyone who has a mobile phone —essentially into an ATM machine.It brings rudimentary banking services to placeswhere there&#39;s no banking infrastructure.And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure,they wouldn&#39;t necessarily be considered viable customers,because they&#39;re not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.There&#39;s a second thing I like about this.And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal,and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication,I know I could never have designed something as elegantand as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK?

zh-cn:是的，我们还有格莱珉银行和小金额贷款他们的区别是这个系统是没有权威机构的束缚完全是街头的创新所以 大街小巷永远是个灵感的源头如果弄坏这个东西，你归还给出售者他们会给你一个新的他们应该会给你3个新的不是吗？不是买三送一吗如果你到印度或中国的街头 ，你会看到诸如此类的生意他们回收损坏的东西然后修理后再循环出售
en:And, yes, there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.But the difference between this and thatis, there&#39;s no central authority trying to control this.This is just street-up innovation.So, it turns out the street is a never-ending source ofinspiration for us.And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.They&#39;ll give you a new one.They&#39;ll probably give you three new ones, right?I mean, that&#39;s buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.And this is where they take the stuff that breaks,and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.

zh-cn:在中国吉林的一个修理铺你可以看到他们把一个手机拆开然后再组装起来用手工破解这些手机的系统这是一种黑客的破解方法被印制成中文和英文甚至北印度语你也可以订购一份他们还设立专门的培训班机构，一窝蜂的培训人怎么修理机子我比较欣赏其中的这点最后这个生意在街边一个很小很矮的店铺落脚一把螺丝刀，一把牙刷用来清理话筒部位因为话筒总是粘灰比较多的地方这个是关于怎样传播这种知识，让它在整个社区传播我喜欢这点的原因是因为这是对我们产品设计的一种挑战和制造产品与潜在产品投放点的挑战也是对标准规格的一种挑战
en:This is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China,and you can see people taking down a phoneand putting it back together.They reverse-engineer manuals.This is a kind of hacker&#39;s manual,and it&#39;s written in Chinese and English.They also write them in Hindi.You can subscribe to these.There are training institutes where they&#39;re churning out peoplefor fixing these things as well.But what I like about this is,it boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface,a screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads —because they often get dust on the contact heads — and knowledge.And it&#39;s all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff,and build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.It challenges the norms.

zh-cn:对我来说，大街小巷会出现层出不穷的问题比如，我在中国的小巷中的一个性保健店买了这瓶伟哥在中国，你可以买到不少假货我知道你会问，难道你自己试用过了我不会回答你这个问题好吧我从另一个角度来观察，我觉得这个一个关于购买过程中信任与自信的一条线索我们怎样把它运用到生活中呢比如说， 做一个构想—从中我们学到的怎样在这些市场策划线上服务与今后的新增服务
en:OK, for me the street just raises so many different questions.Like, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.And I know what you&#39;re asking — did I test it?I&#39;m not going to answer that, OK.But I look at something like this, and I consider the implicationsof trust and confidence in the purchase process.And we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply,for example, for the design of — the lessons from this —apply to the design of online services, future services in these markets?

en:This is a pair of underpants from —(Laughter) —from Tibet.And I look at something like this, and honestly, you know,why would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?And I look at something like this and it makes me question,if we were to take all the functionality in things like this,and redistribute them around the bodyin some kind of personal area network,how would we prioritize where to put stuff?And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to thatkind of personal area networks.And what you see here is a couple of phone numberswritten above the shack in rural Uganda.This doesn&#39;t have house numbers. This has phone numbers.So what does it mean when people&#39;s identity is mobile?When those extra three billion people&#39;s identity is mobile, it isn&#39;t fixed?Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK,for those extra three billion people.This is how it&#39;s shifting.

en:And then I go to this picture here, which is the one that I started with.And this is from Delhi.It&#39;s from a study we did into illiteracy,and it&#39;s a guy in a teashop.You can see the chai being poured in the background.And he&#39;s a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker,on the lowest rungs in the society.And he, somehow, has the appreciationof the values of Livestrong.And it&#39;s not necessarily the same values,but some kind of values of Livestrong,to actually go out and purchase them,and actually display them.

zh-cn:其中有四个元素第一是构想的直观性构想酝酿的速度我知道TED以出大构想为名但是大构想的基准正在改变如果你想要出大构想，你必须先接受这个星球上的每一个人这个是第一步
en:And there are four things.So, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas,the speed at which ideas go around.And I know TED is about big ideas,but actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.If you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet,that&#39;s the first thing.
时间：14:22
zh-cn:第二是目标的直观性当这些东西变的越来越小他们的功能却越来越强大比如银行业，身份认证这些元素顺其自然的在全球传播的很快所以对事物的接受速度也将变的越来越快我们无法用语言来表达当全世界有63亿人的时候全球的人口在增长
en:The second thing is the immediacy of objects.And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller,as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater —things like banking, identity —these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.And so the speed of the adoption of thingsis just going to become that much more rapid,in a way that we just totally cannot conceive,when you get it to 6.3 billionand the growth in the world&#39;s population.

zh-cn:无论我们怎样想方设法设计这东西非常小心谨慎的设计这东西在街头混的小子们会把它弄个明白再做出新的创新只要能与他们基本需求温和举个例子，拥有穿越时间与空间的本领他们会做我们根本无法预期的不同创新他们甚至能比我们做的更好至少我是这样认为的如果我们够聪明的话，我们会关注这些东西的发展趋势我们会找到一种方法来使其发扬光大关于设计和怎样设计
en:The next thing is that, however we design this stuff —carefully design this stuff —the street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate,as long as it meets base needs —the ability to transcend space and time, for example.And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.In ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.That&#39;s my feeling.And if we&#39;re smart, we&#39;ll look at this stuff that&#39;s going on,and we&#39;ll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuseboth what we design and how we design.

zh-cn:最后一点， 就是这次谈论的重点当3亿人被联系到了一起他们也希望参与交流我认为我们和TED的主旨最根本是接受并学习怎么去聆听我们需要学习怎么聆听所以非常非常感谢你们今天的参与鼓掌
en:And the last thing is that — actually, the direction of the conversation.With another three billion people connected,they want to be part of the conversation.And I think our relevance and TED&#39;s relevanceis really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.And we need to learn how to listen.So thank you very, very much.(Applause)
