zh-cn:在过去的13年里－1,3,13年－我作为以色列InSightech里一个优秀团队里的一员协同世界各地的同道之士将一个新构想，一个理念——非侵入性手术从研究实验室带进日常临床应用这将是我要谈论的话题13年－在座各位当中有些人会对这个数字产生共鸣对我来说就像第二次成年礼一样
en:Over the last 13 years —one, three, 13 years —I&#39;ve been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israeland partners around the worldfor taking this idea, this concept,noninvasive surgery,from the research lab to routine clinical use.And this is what I&#39;ll tell you about.13 years —for some of you, you can empathize with that number.For me, today, on this date,it&#39;s like a second bar mitzvah experience.

zh-cn:这个梦想的实现是两项现存技术结合的结果一个是聚焦超声另一个是可视化磁共振成像技术首先来谈谈聚焦超声我手里是一个组织模型由硅材料制成透明的，便于大家观察显而易见，它是完整的完全透明的现在我们来到声学实验室可以看到玻璃缸里的透视图这是我在物理实验室里的装置在右边是一台超声传感器当超声传感器对着模型内部发射出一束超声波束你听见咔嗒声就是能量要发射了然后你能看见模型内部出现了小小的损坏而周围一切都完好无损损伤完全从内部形成试想一下，如果这是你的大脑我们要击中大脑内部的一处目标我们可以在不伤及任何组织的情况下办到我想这是第一个符合犹太戒律的希波克拉底手术系统
en:So this dreamis really enabledby the convergenceof two known technologies.One is the focused ultrasound,and the other one is thevision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging.So let&#39;s first talk about focused ultrasound.And I hold in my handa tissue-mimicking phantom.It is made out of silicon.It is transparent, made just for you.So you see, it&#39;s all intact,completely transparent.I&#39;ll take you now to the acoustic lab.You see the phantom within the aquarium.This is a setup I put in a physics lab.On the right-hand side,you see an ultrasonic transducer.So the ultrasonic transduceremits basically an ultrasonic beamthat focuses inside the phantom.Okay, when you hear the click,this is when the energy starts to emitand you see a little lesion forminside the phantom.Okay, so everything around itis whole and intact.It&#39;s just a lesion formed inside.So think about, this is in your brain.We need to reach a target inside the brain.We can do it without harming any tissue.So this is, I think,the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system.

zh-cn:接下来谈谈超声波超声波的力量大家都知道超声波成像还有体外震波碎石术可以震碎肾结石但超声波可以成为两者间的任何形态因为它是一种机械力它横穿组织时对其产生作用力所以可以通过改变超声波的强度、频率波长和脉冲波形来创造出从喷枪到铁锤的任何东西接下来我要展示的是通过聚焦超声波只用物理聚焦在医疗领域中的多种应用
en:Okay, so let&#39;s talk a little bit about ultrasound,the force of ultrasound.You know all about imaging, right, ultrasound imaging.And you know also about lithotripsy —breaking kidney stones.But ultrasound can be shapedto be anything in between,because it&#39;s a mechanical force.Basically, it&#39;s a force acting on a tissuethat it transverses.So you can change the intensity, the frequency,the duration, the pulse shape of the ultrasoundto create anythingfrom an airbrush to a hammer.And I am going to show youmultiple applications in the medical fieldthat can be enabledjust by focusing,physically focusing.

zh-cn:使用聚焦超声波来治疗脑损伤并不是新理念这个构想早在我出生之前就已经形成了，比如弗莱兄弟和拉尔斯･莱克塞尔后者因发明伽玛刀而闻名但大家可能不知道早在五十年代他尝试利用聚焦超声波进行非侵入式前脑白质切断术没有成功于是他发明了伽玛刀于是你会思索为什么这些先辈都没有成功因为一些关键的东西未被发现和使用他们缺少成像技术直到磁共振成像的发明直到磁共振成像与聚焦超声波的合二为一我们才能在解剖学和生理学上得到肯定答案才可以执行完全无侵入、完全体内进行的手术
en:So this ideaof harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brainis not new at all.When I was born, this idea was already conceivedby pioneers such as the Fry brothersand Lars Leksell,who is know actuallyas the inventor of the gammaknife.But you may not knowthat he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain,noninvasively,with focused ultrasound in the &#39;50s.He failed,so he then invented the gammaknife.And it makes you ponderwhy those pioneers failed.And there was something fundamentalthat they were missing.They were missing the vision.It wasn&#39;t until the invention of the MRand really the integration of MRwith focused ultrasoundthat we could get the feedback —both the anatomical and the physiologicalin order to have a completely noninvasive, closed-loopsurgical procedure.

zh-cn:这就是今天看到的未来手术室的样子这是配有聚焦超声波系统的磁成像成套设备我会给大家看一些例子第一个位于大脑内部可以通过聚焦超声波治疗的一个神经性病症是运动障碍比如帕金森氏症或者原发性颤抖症这类疾病的典型症状就是比如原发性颤抖症就是吃麦片或喝汤的时候会把汤洒得到处都是或者写的字没人能识别必须依赖别人的帮助才能生活
en:So this is how it looks, you know,the operating room of the future today.This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system.And I will give you several examples.So the first one is in the brain.One of the neurological conditionsthat can be treated with focused ultrasoundare movement disorders,like Parkinson&#39;s or essential tremor.What is typical to those conditions,to essential tremor for example,is inabilityto drink or eat cereal or soupwithout spilling everything all over you,or write legibly so people can understand it,and be really independent in your lifewithout the help of others.

zh-cn:让我介绍一下 约翰约翰是一位退休的历史教授来自维吉尼亚患原发性颤抖症多年药物治疗再无成效许多类似的病人拒绝手术因为需要开颅大概四五个月前他接受了一个实验性治疗这个治疗在夏洛特斯维尔的弗吉尼亚大学获得了美国食品药物管理监督局的临床实验医疗器材许可使用聚焦超声切除他视丘里的一个点这是他的字迹如果大家看得请的话， “6月20日”“2011年”这是他的字迹接受磁共振治疗前的之前写下的接下来我要带各位了解一下典型的手术流程非侵入性手术的过程
en:So I&#39;d like you to meet John.John is a retired professor of historyfrom Virginia.So he suffered from essential tremor for many years.And medication didn&#39;t help him anymore.And many of those patients refused to undergo surgeryto have people cut into their brain.And about four or five months ago,he underwent an experimental procedure.It is approved under an FDAIDEat the University of Virginiain Charlottesvilleusing focused ultrasoundto ablate a point in his thalamus.And this is his handwriting.&quot;On June 20th,&quot; if you can read it,&quot;2011.&quot;This is his handwritingon the morning of the treatmentbefore going into the MRSo now I&#39;ll take you through[what] a typical procedure like that looks like,[what] noninvasive surgery looks like.

zh-cn:我们将病人平置于磁共振的手术台上装上传感器，这里是针对大脑的如果是其他的器官就会用其他不一样的传感器医生会先进行常规磁共振扫描扫描对象呢？我手头没有指示棒不过你看到这些绿色的类似矩形或梯形的部分吗？这可以说是治疗的大致区域这是目标周围的安全区域这是视丘中的手术对象只要获取这些图片并且医生也划出了所有必要的安全限制范围等等，他就会选取一个点－就是正中间，箭头所指的那个圆点－然后他按下这个叫“声处理”的按钮我们把注射能量这一步叫做声波降解法医生唯一的体力活就是移动鼠标鼠标是他在治疗过程中唯一需要的设备
en:So we put the patient on the MR table.We attach a transducer, in this case, to the brain,but if it will be a different organ,it will be a different transducer attached to the patient.And the physicianwill then take a regular MR scan.And the objective of that?I don&#39;t have a pointer here,but you see the green, sort of rectangle or trapezoid?This is the sort of general area of the treatment.It&#39;s a safety boundaryaround the target.It&#39;s a target in the thalamus.So once those pictures are acquiredand the physician has drawnall the necessary safety limits and so on,he selects basically a point —you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is —and he presses this blue button called &quot;sonicate.&quot;We call this instance of injecting the energy,we call it sonication.The only handwork the physician does hereis moving a mouse.This is the only device he needs in this treatment.
时间： 6:54
zh-cn:他按下“声处理”，接下来请看传感器，就是淡蓝的部分头颅和传感器之间是水传感器释放出能量提高温度我们首先得确认是否命中目标因此第一次超声波降解发射能量较低不会产生任何伤害只会把温度提高几度而已磁共振的一个独特功能就是非侵入性温度测量这是磁共振的特有功能一般不会用于常规的造影诊断但我们可以使用它取得实时的解剖影像和温度走势图可以看到图像上的这些点温度被暂时提升至43摄氏度这不会造成任何伤害但重点是我们命中目标了一旦医生确定聚焦点击中选定目标下一步便是高能切除如图所示温度上升到55到66摄氏度如果这种状态持续超过一秒基本上就足够摧毁细胞中的蛋白质了
en:So he presses &quot;sonicate,&quot; and this is what happens.You see the transducer, the light blue.There&#39;s water in between the skull and the transducer.And it does this burst of energy.It elevates the temperature.We first need to verifythat we are on target.So the first sonicationis at lower energy.It doesn&#39;t do any damage,but it elevates the temperatureby a few degrees.And one of the unique capabilitiesthat we leverage with the MRis the ability to measure temperature noninvasively.This is really a unique capability of the MR.It is not being usedin regular diagnostic imaging.But here we can getboth the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time.And you can see the points there on the graph.The temperature was raisedto 43 degrees C temporarily.This doesn&#39;t cause any damage.But the point is we are right on target.So once the physician verifiesthat the focus spot is on the target he has chosen,then we move to performa full-energy ablationlike you see here.And you see the temperature risesto like 55 to 60 degrees C.If you do it for more than a second,it&#39;s enough to basically destroythe proteins of the cells.

zh-cn:这是病人眼中的术后结果－治疗结束的当天症状立刻消失了（掌声）谢谢约翰是众多有胆量和勇气参加这项研究的志愿者之一需要知道的是当他们决定冒这个险时他们心里想的是什么约翰写下这些之后他说：“太神奇了！”他的妻子说：“这是我一生中最开心的时刻。“也许你不理解我想说的是为什么我们要维护生活的质量？这些人失去独立生活的能力他们要依赖于别人而约翰现在完全不用依靠别人了他恢复了正常人的生活他会去打高尔夫球就像很多人在维吉尼亚的退休生活好，请看这里的雾状物在大脑中间大约3毫米处没有任何外部损伤他没有任何神经损伤没有康复期 什么都不用他直接恢复到正常生活
en:This is the outcome from a patient perspective —same day after the treatment.This is an immediate relief.(Applause)Thank you.John is one of [about] a dozenvery heroic, courageous peoplewho volunteered for the study.And you have to understandwhat is in people&#39;s mindwhen they are willing to take the risk.And this is a quote from John after he wrote it.He said, &quot;Miraculous.&quot;And his wife said, &quot;This is the happiest moment of my life.&quot;And you wonder why.I mean, one of the messages I like to carry overis, what about defending quality of life?I mean, those people lose their independence.They are dependent on others.And John today is fully independent.He returned to a normal life routine.And he also plays golf,like you do in Virginiawhen you are retired.Okay, so you can see here the spot.It&#39;s like three millimeters in the middle of the brain.There&#39;s no damage outside.He suffers from no neurodeficit.There&#39;s no recovery needed, no nothing.He&#39;s back to his normal life.

zh-cn:下面我们要谈论一个痛苦的话题疼痛可以让生活变得很悲惨人们承受着各种各样的痛苦比如神经痛、腰痛骨转移带来的癌症疼痛当癌细胞转移进入你的骨髓有时候会非常非常痛我谈到的这些痛症都已经被证实可以通过聚焦超声技术非常快速地治愈可以一下子消除疼痛下面我想介绍一下PJ他是个农民 78岁了他的疼痛来自臀部他的癌细胞转移到了臀部右侧即使有药物治疗他也无法坐下他停止了任何劳作接受了放射治疗最先进的放射治疗但毫无帮助很多病人倾向于放射治疗
en:Let&#39;s move nowto a more painful subject.Pain is somethingthat can make your life miserable.And people are suffering from all kinds of painlike neuropathic pain, lower-back painand cancer pain from bone metastases,when the metastases get to your bones,sometimes they are very painful.All those I&#39;ve indicatedhave already been shownto be successfully treatedby focused ultrasoundrelieving the pain, again, very fast.And I would like to tell youabout PJ.He&#39;s a 78 year-old farmerwho suffered from — how should I say it? —it&#39;s called pain in the butt.He had metastases in his right buttock,and he couldn&#39;t siteven with medication.He had to forgo all the farm activities.He was treated with radiation therapy,state-of-the-art radiation therapy,but it didn&#39;t help.Many patients like that favor radiation therapy.

zh-cn:但他决定参与我们这个在世界范围内进行的重大研究项目当然也包括美国是他的妻子带他来的他们从农场开了大概三个小时的车他得坐在一个垫子上一动都不能动不然就会很痛他接受了治疗回家路上他就能自己开卡车了这再次证明 治疗瞬间就消除了疼痛瞬间你可以体会当病痛解除时这些病人和他们家人的感受他又开始了每天在农场的劳作他开着他拖拉机骑着马定期去山间小屋从此一直都很开心
en:And again, he volunteeredto a pivotal studythat we ran worldwide,also in the U.S.And his wife actually took him.They drove like three hoursfrom their farm to the hospital.He had to sit on a cushion,stand still, not move,because it was very painful.He took the treatment,and on the way back,he drove the truck by himself.So again, this is an immediate relief.And you have to understandwhat those people feeland what their family experienceswhen it happens.He returned againto his daily routine on the farm.He rides his tractor.He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly.And he has been very happy.

zh-cn:但现在你会问我那么对癌症的宣战呢？我们要看看对于那些首要癌症这个研究能做些什么呢？我这儿有好消息，也有坏消息好消息是：我们能做的有很多这点美国以外地区已经得到证实但是在美国的话非常棘手似乎没有全民为之请愿或视其为国民目标来推进事情就没法办成我不这样认为这不仅是制度法规的问题还有现行的实证医学体系下要投入的巨额资金以及临床试验的规模等等都成为实现目标的阻碍
en:But now, you ask me,but what about war, the war on cancer?Show us some primary cancer.What can be done there?So I have good news and bad news.The good news: there&#39;s a lot that can be done.And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.And doing that in the U.S.is very painful.I don&#39;t see, without this nationtaking it as some collective willor something that is a national goal to make that happen,it will not happen.And it&#39;s not just because of regulation;it&#39;s because of the amount of money neededunder the current evidence-based medicineand the size of trials and so onto make it happen.

zh-cn:研究的首要两项应用是乳腺癌和前列腺癌这两种是癌症中首先使用聚焦超声波治疗的乳腺癌的治疗结果显示比手术效果更好不过有个消息提供给在场男士听说吉兰昨天在这里探讨了前列腺癌治疗的不良症状通过使用磁共振成像和聚焦超声波技术我们有一个全新的治疗前景因为我们可以考虑前列腺肿瘤切除－治疗局部病变而不用切除整个腺体这样就避免了性功能丧失和尿失禁问题其他的一些出现在腹腔的癌症－相当致命，可以说很致命胰脏，肝脏，肾脏里的治疗的困难是－病人是完全清醒的在我们所有的治疗中病人完全清醒可以和医生交谈－困难就是我们得让磁共振成像实现实时成像这不容易我们花了两年做到
en:So the first two applicationsare breast cancer and prostate cancer.They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound.And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts.But I have a message for the men here.We heard here yesterday Quyentalking about the adverse event traitin prostate cancer.There is a unique opportunity nowwith focused ultrasound guided by MR,because we can actually think aboutprostate lumpectomy —treating just the focal lesionand not removing the whole gland,and by that, avoiding all the issueswith potency and incontinence.Well, there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen —quite lethal, very lethal actually —pancreas, liver, kidney.The challenge therewith a breathing and awake patient —and in all our treatments,the patient is awake and consciousand speaks with the physician —is you have to teach the MR some trickshow to do it in real time.And this will take time.This will take two years.

zh-cn:现在有一个带给女士们的消息2004年美国食品药物管理局已经批准了磁共振成像引导聚焦超声波技术应用于子宫肌瘤的临床治疗女性常受此病痛折磨肿瘤会导致经期大量出血腹部张痛 背痛尿频有时甚至会导致无法受孕这位女性住在法国她被诊断出长有一个柚子大小的子宫肌瘤这是很大的子宫肌瘤医生建议她切除子宫但对于期望怀孕的人来说这是无法接受的选择她在2008年选择了接受聚焦超声波治疗2010年她成了一个健康宝宝的妈妈就这样一个新生命诞生了
en:But I have now a message to the ladies.And this is, in 2004,the FDA has approved MR-guided focused ultrasoundsfor the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.Women suffer from that disease.All those tumorshave heavy bleeding during periods,abdominal pressure, back pain,frequent urination.And sometimes, they cannot even conceive and become pregnantbecause of the fibroid.This is Frances.She was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid.This is a big fibroid.She was offered a hysterectomy,but this is an inconceivable propositionfor someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option.So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedurein 2008.And in 2010, she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby.So new life was born.

zh-cn:最后我想要给各位留下四个信息首先试想一下非侵入式手术可以让多少病人脱离苦海可以帮助他们的家人、社区还有社会减轻多少经济和情感上的负担－我想应该也减轻了医生的负担另外请想象一下医患之间形成了一种新的关系当病人躺着手术台上他是完全清醒的甚至可以监督治疗在我们的治疗中病人握着一个解除手术的按钮病人可以随时中止手术
en:So in conclusion,I&#39;d like to leave you with actually four messages.One is, think about the amountof suffering that is savedfrom patients undergoing noninvasive surgery,and also the economical and emotional burdenremoved from their families and communitiesand the society at large —and I think also from their physicians, by the way.And the other thing I would like you to think aboutis the new type of relationshipbetween physician and patientswhen you have a patient on the table[who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment.In all our treatments,the patient holds a stop sonication button.He can stop the surgery at any moment.
