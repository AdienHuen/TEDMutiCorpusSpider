zh-cn:当父亲和我创立公司从事3D打印人体组织和器官时有些人觉得我们有点疯狂但进展已今非昔比不只在我们的实验室 全球皆然因此有人开始问我们“如果你们能制造人体部位能否制造动物产品？例如肉和皮革”
en:When my father and I started a companyto 3D print human tissues and organs,some people initially thought we were a little crazy.But since then, much progress has been made,both in our lab and other labs around the world.And given this, we started getting questions like,&quot;If you can grow human body parts,can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?&quot;

zh-cn:当我第一次听到有人这么提议老实说我觉得他们才有点疯狂但是我很快就发现其实这并不疯狂真正疯狂的是我们现在做的事情我确信30年以后回顾今天我们如何饲养并屠宰数十亿牲畜以制作汉堡肉和手袋我们会明白这既浪费又疯狂你是否知道我们现在饲养了全球共600亿牲畜提供我们所需的肉 奶制品 蛋 和皮具？在未来数十年当世界人口将增至100亿时这个数目将几乎倍增到1000亿牲畜
en:When someone first suggested this to me,quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy,but what I soon came to realizewas that this is not so crazy after all.What&#39;s crazy is what we do today.I&#39;m convinced that in 30 years,when we look back on todayand on how we raise and slaughter billions of animalsto make our hamburgers and our handbags,we&#39;ll see this as being wastefuland indeed crazy.Did you know that today we maintaina global herd of 60 billion animalsto provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?And over the next few decades,as the world&#39;s population expands to 10 billion,this will need to nearly doubleto 100 billion animals.

zh-cn:但是养这么多牲畜会造成地球的沉重负担牲畜不仅是原料也是生灵我们的牲畜已经是最大的土地使用以及淡水消耗者之一以及最大的温室气体排放者之一导致气候变迁除此之外当这么多动物如此密集地饲养会变成疾病的温床动物也容易被伤害和虐待显然这条路难以为继因为环境 公众健康以及粮食安全都将面临风险
en:But maintaining this herdtakes a major toll on our planet.Animals are not just raw materials.They&#39;re living beings,and already our livestockis one of the largest users of land,fresh water,and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gaseswhich drive climate change.On top of this,when you get so many animals so close together,it creates a breeding ground for diseaseand opportunities for harm and abuse.Clearly, we cannot continue on this pathwhich puts the environment, public health,and food security at risk.

zh-cn:但是有另一条路 因为基本上动物制品是由组织构成我们现在饲养的高度复杂的牲畜我们需要的却只是他们身上相对简单的组织如果我们与其着手于复杂并有知觉的动物不如着手于组织的成分也就是生命的基本单位细胞会如何？
en:There is another way, because essentially,animal products are just collections of tissues,and right now we breed and raisehighly complex animalsonly to create productsthat are made of relatively simple tissues.What if, instead of starting with a complexand sentient animal,we started with what the tissues are made of,the basic unit of life,the cell?

zh-cn:这是生物制造(biofabrication) 利用细胞培养生物产品例如组织和器官医学界已经使用生物制造技术去培养复杂的身体部位例如耳朵 气管 皮肤 血管 骨骼都已成功地植入了病人体内医疗用途之外 生物制造也可以是人道 可持续 容易调整规模的新产业
en:This is biofabrication, where cells themselvescan be used to grow biological productslike tissues and organs.Already in medicine,biofabrication techniques have been usedto grow sophisticated body parts,like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone,that have been successfully implanted into patients.And beyond medicine, biofabrication can bea humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.

zh-cn:我们应该从从新思考皮革开始我着重于皮革因为其使用广泛它美丽且历史悠久制造皮革的技术相对较简单不像制造肉那么困难皮革以一种细胞为主大体上是平面的构造对于消费者和监管单位也较无争议在更暸解生物制造之前显然 至少刚开始时较多人会愿意穿戴新奇的材料较少人会愿意吃新奇的食物无论有多好吃从这个角度 皮革是个途径开创主流生物制造工业的起点如果皮革成功了将会为其他例如肉的生物消费品带来一线希望
en:And we should begin by reimagining leather.I emphasize leather because it is so widely used.It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.Growing leather is also technically simplerthan growing other animal products like meat.It mainly uses one cell type,and it is largely two-dimensional.It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.Until biofabrication is better understood,it is clear that, initially at least,more people would be willing to wear novel materialsthan would be willing to eat novel foods,no matter how delicious.In this sense, leather is a gateway material,a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry.If we can succeed here,it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meatcloser on the horizon.

zh-cn:我们是怎么做到的？制造皮革首先要取出动物的细胞做简单的活检动物可以是牛羊 甚至较奇特的动物这个步骤不会伤害动物牛小姐可以继续快乐生活我们然后分离皮肤细胞以便在培养液里繁殖从数百万细胞繁殖到数十亿然后我们诱导细胞制造胶原蛋白这是其天然功能在细胞之间的胶原蛋白是天然的结缔组织是细胞外基质但在皮革里是主要的成分下一步是萃取细胞及胶原蛋白将其铺展成薄片再把薄片堆迭起来形成较厚层 像酥皮糕点然后待其成熟最后这种多层的皮肤再经过较短少的化学鞣制程序我们制造了皮革我以激动的心情向各位首次展示第一批培养出来的皮革实验室刚刚出炉这是真的皮革没有动物被杀害它能具有皮革全部的特性因为组成的细胞相同但更棒的是它不用除毛没有疤痕或虫咬没有碎料这种皮革能一体成型 长成皮夹手提包 或汽车座位的形状不像牛或鳄鱼的皮形状不规则
en:Now how do we do it?To grow leather, we begin by taking cellsfrom an animal, through a simple biopsy.The animal could be a cow,lamb, or even something more exotic.This process does no harm,and Daisy the cow can live a happy life.We then isolate the skin cellsand multiply them in a cell culture medium.This takes millions of cellsand expands them into billions.And we then coax these cells to produce collagen,as they would naturally.This collagen is the stuff between cells.It&#39;s natural connective tissue.It&#39;s the extracellular matrix,but in leather, it&#39;s the main building block.And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagenand we spread them out to form sheets,and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another,like phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets,which we then let mature.And finally, we take this multilayered skinand through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process,we create leather.And so I&#39;m very excited to show you,for the first time,the first batch of our cultured leather,fresh from the lab.This is real, genuine leather,without the animal sacrifice.It can have all the characteristics of leatherbecause it is made of the same cells,and better yet,there is no hair to remove,no scars or insect&#39;s bites,and no waste.This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet,a handbag or a car seat.It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cowor an alligator.

zh-cn:因为这是我们制造的从头开始培养的皮革我们可以以有去的方式控制其属性这个皮革组织仅有七层可以看得出几乎是透明的这个皮革是21层 相当不透明这种细致的操控是普通的皮革无法达到的我们能调整其他想要的性质例如柔软性 透气性耐久性 弹性 甚至花样我们可以模仿自然但有些方面也能加以改进现有皮革的功能 这种皮革都有但运用想象力 功能还可能更多
en:And because we make this material,we grow this leather from the ground up,we can control its properties in very interesting ways.This piece of leatheris a mere seven tissue layers thick,and as you can see, it is nearly transparent.And this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque.You don&#39;t have that kind of fine controlwith conventional leather.And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities,like softness, breathability,durability, elasticity and even things like pattern.We can mimic nature,but in some ways also improve upon it.This type of leather can do what today&#39;s leather does,but with imagination, probably much more.

zh-cn:动物产品的未来如何？不必像这个样子其实这已是目前最先进的但是更可以像这样我们把培养的细胞用于生产已有数千年历史 最早的产品包括酒 啤酒 酸奶说到食品 培养食品历经演变现在的培养食品来自这种美丽 消过毒的厂房啤酒厂基本上是生物反应器细胞的培养在此进行试想在这个厂房不是酿造啤酒而是培养皮革或肉想想看参观这个厂房学习皮革和肉的培养观察从头到尾的制造程序甚至试一试清洁 开放 具教育意义这截然不同于现在隐秘 门禁森严 偏远的皮革工厂和肉工厂或许生物制造是人类制造方式的自然演进它环保有效率又人道我们得以发挥创造力我们能设计新材质 新产品新厂房我们应该超越将动物作为资源而杀害应该转向更文明与进化的方式或许我们已准备迎接更多培养的 文明的产品
en:What could the future of animal products look like?It need not look like this,which is actually the state of the art today.Rather, it could be much more like this.Already, we have been manufacturing with cell culturesfor thousands of years, beginning with productslike wine, beer and yogurt.And speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved,and today we prepare cultured foodin beautiful, sterile facilities like this.A brewery is essentially a bioreactor.It is where cell culture takes place.Imagine that in this facility,instead of brewing beer,we were brewing leatheror meat.Imagine touring this facility,learning about how the leather or meat is cultured,seeing the process from beginning to end,and even trying some.It&#39;s clean, open and educational,and this is in contrast to the hidden,guarded and remote factorieswhere leather and meat is produced today.Perhaps biofabricationis a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind.It&#39;s environmentally responsible,efficient and humane.It allows us to be creative.We can design new materials, new products,and new facilities.We need to move past just killing animalsas a resourceto something more civilized and evolved.Perhaps we are ready for somethingliterally and figuratively more cultured.
