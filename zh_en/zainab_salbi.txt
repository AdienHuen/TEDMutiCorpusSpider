zh-cn:半夜里一声巨大的爆炸声把我从睡梦中惊醒当时已经很晚了我不记得确切的时间只记得那声音是如此巨大如此吓人我屋里的每样东西都在晃动我的心，我的窗户我的床，全都在晃动我望向窗外看到一个完整的半圆形火球我心想这简直就是电影可电影却无法准确表现我所看到的震慑人心的画面那鲜亮的红色橙色和灰色以及爆炸产生的的一团火球我目不转睛地盯着直到那团火球消失然后我回到床上开始祷告我偷偷地感谢上帝只因那枚导弹没有打中我家没有杀死我的家人三十年过去了我仍对那次的祷告感到愧疚因为第二天我才知道，那枚导弹打中了我哥哥的朋友家并且杀死了他和他的父亲他的母亲和妹妹则逃过一劫一个礼拜后他的母亲去到我哥哥的教室恳求那些七岁大的孩子能够把他们手中有她儿子的照片统统给她因为她失去了一切
en:I woke up in the middle of the nightwith the sound of heavy explosion.It was deep at night.I do not remember what time it was.I just remember the soundwas so heavyand so very shocking.Everything in my room was shaking —my heart, my windows,my bed, everything.I looked out the windowsand I saw a full half-circleof explosion.I thought it was just like the movies,but the movies had not conveyed themin the powerful image that I was seeingfull of bright redand orange and gray,and a full circle of explosion.And I kept on staring at ituntil it disappeared.I went back to my bed,and I prayed,and I secretly thanked Godthat that missiledid not land on my family&#39;s home,that it did not kill my family that night.Thirty years have passed,and I still feel guilty about that prayer,for the next day, I learned that that missilelanded on my brother&#39;s friend&#39;s homeand killed himand his father,but did not kill his mother or his sister.His mother showed up the next weekat my brother&#39;s classroomand begged seven-year-old kidsto share with her any picture they may haveof her son,for she had lost everything.

zh-cn:这个故事不是关于某个在战争中存活下来的无名者也不是关于我们常在报纸或电视中看到的那些无名的难民他们衣不蔽体蓬头垢面，眼神惊恐这也不是某些我们不知道姓名的人的故事那些生活在某场战争中我们不知道他们的希望与梦想不清楚他们的成就与家庭也不了解他们的信仰和价值观这是我的故事我就是那个女孩我就是另一个有关战争存活者的鲜活的描绘我就是那个难民我就是那个女孩你现在知道我在战争中的伊拉克成长我相信战争有不同的两面而我们只看到其中的一面我们只谈论其中的一面但战争还有另一面这一面我亲眼见过作为一个曾经生活在其中的人一个最终从事这方面工作的人
en:This is not a storyof a nameless survivor of war,and nameless refugees,whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapersand our TVwith tattered clothes,dirty face, scared eyes.This is not a story of a nameless someonewho lived in some war,who we do not know their hopes, their dreams,their accomplishments, their families,their beliefs, their values.This is my story.I was that girl.I am another image and visionof another survivor of war.I am that refugee,and I am that girl.You see,I grew up in war-torn Iraq,and I believe that there are two sides of warsand we&#39;ve only seenone side of it.We only talk aboutone side of it.But there&#39;s another sidethat I have witnessedas someone who lived in itand someone who ended up working in it.

zh-cn:我在战争的颜色中成长红色的血与火棕色的土地爆炸就在我面前还有银色的碎片导弹爆炸时飞散而来那么明亮没有东西可以保护你的眼睛我成长于战争的声音中那些断断续续的枪火声折磨人的爆炸声飞机过顶时的轰隆声还有警笛发出的哀号这些都是你能想到的声音还有一些声音比如说一群鸟在深夜发出不和谐的尖叫孩子们发出的高亢的哭声还有如雷般难以忍受的寂静“战争”，我的一个朋友曾经说过“根本不是有声的它其实是一种沉默人性的沉默”
en:I grew up with the colors of war —the red colors of fire and blood,the brown tones of earthas it explodesin our facesand the piercing silverof an exploded missile,so brightthat nothing can protect your eyes from it.I grew upwith the sounds of war —the staccato sounds of gunfire,the wrenching booms of explosions,ominous drones of jets flying overheadand the wailing warning soundsof sirens.These are the sounds you would expect,but they are also the soundsof dissonant concerts of a flock of birdsscreeching in the night,the high-pitched honest criesof childrenand the thunderous,unbearablesilence.&quot;War,&quot; a friend of mine said,&quot;is not about sound at all.It is actually about silence,the silence of humanity.&quot;

zh-cn:从那以后我离开了伊拉克成立了一个叫做国际妇女互助会(Women for Women International)的组织并最终和一群战争中存活下来的女性们一起工作在我的旅途和工作中从刚果到阿富汗从苏丹到卢旺达我发现不仅战争的颜色和声音是相同的对战争的恐惧也是一样的对死亡的恐惧是众所周知的不要相信那些电影中对死亡无所畏惧的英雄非常的恐怖经历那种“我要死了”或者“我可能会在爆炸中死亡”的感觉但是还有一种对于失去至亲的恐惧在我看来更为可怕光是想想就能让你觉得痛苦不堪但我认为最大的恐惧正如一个经历了四年萨拉热窝围城的波斯尼亚女人Samia曾对我说的那样她说，“是害怕失去内在的自我害怕失去内在的自我”我在伊拉克的母亲也曾经这么说过这好像从内心开始死去一样一个巴勒斯但女人曾跟我说”这不是对一次死亡的恐惧我有时甚至觉得我一天死了十次。“她同时跟我描述士兵列队前进还有他们的子弹的声音她继续说道，”但不公平因为生命只有一次死亡也应该只有一次。”
en:I have since left Iraqand founded a group called Women for Women Internationalthat ends up workingwith women survivors of wars.In my travels and in my work,from Congo to Afghanistan,from Sudan to Rwanda,I have learned not onlythat the colors and the sounds of war are the same,but the fears of war are the same.You know, there is a fear of dying,and do not believe any movie characterwhere the hero is not afraid.It is very scaryto go through that feelingof &quot;I am about to die&quot;or &quot;I could die in this explosion.&quot;But there&#39;s also the fearof losing loved ones,and I think that&#39;s even worse.It&#39;s too painful. You don&#39;t want to think about it.But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear —as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me,who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo;she said, &quot;The fearof losingthe &#39;I&#39; in me,the fear of losingthe &#39;I&#39; in me.&quot;That&#39;s what my mother in Iraqused to tell me.It&#39;s like dying from inside-out.A Palestinian woman once told me,&quot;It is not about the fear of one death,&quot;she said, &quot;sometimes I feelI die 10 times in one day,&quot;as she was describing the marches of soldiersand the sounds of their bullets.She said, &quot;But it&#39;s not fair,because there is only one life,and there should only be one death.&quot;

zh-cn:我们只看到战争的一面我们只探讨和高度关注作战计划和时间线的制定关注如何进攻和打击而我们却更应该去研究从社会被撕裂得最严重的地方开始研究人们是如何应变以及生存同时表现出让生活继续的韧性和惊人的勇气我们听到了太多表面上很客观的讨论和论调无论是关于政治、战术武器、美元还是伤亡人数这些都是贫乏无力的语言
en:We have been only seeingone side of war.We have only been discussing and consumedwith high-level preoccupationsover troop levels, drawdown timelines,surges and sting operations,when we should be examining the detailsof where the social fabrichas been most torn,where the community has improvisedand survivedand shown acts of resilienceand amazing couragejust to keep life going.We have been so consumedwith seemingly objective discussionsof politics, tactics,weapons, dollarsand casualties.This is the languageof sterility.

zh-cn:我们竟用如此漫不经心的口吻谈论战争伤害好像我们觉得强奸和伤亡都是不可避免的一样世界上有80%的难民是女人和孩童现代战争中平民占了90%的伤亡其中又有75%是妇女和孩童真有意思啊在卢旺达，有50万女人在100天内被强奸就在此刻成百上千的刚果女人被强奸和凌虐真有意思啊这些却只是成为我们参考的数字在战争前线不断增加的卫星从太空中俯视着我们已知的敌人指引导弹飞向隐形的目标当人们为了媒体文章的丰富性而表演时这架无人驾驶的武器没有击中极端分子打到一个村民这是一场国际象棋比赛你学习如何去玩一场国际关系的比赛当你离开时在国内和国际领导者中游刃有余完全失败！
en:How casuallywe treat casualtiesin the context of this topic.This is where we conceive of rape and casualtiesas inevitabilities.Eighty percent of refugees around the worldare women and children. Oh.Ninety percent of modern war casualtiesare civilians.Seventy-five percent of them are women and children.How interesting.Oh, half a million women in Rwandaget raped in 100 days.Or, as we speak now,hundreds of thousands of Congolese womenare getting raped and mutilated.How interesting.These just become numbers that we refer to.The front of warsis increasingly non-human eyespeering down on our perceived enemiesfrom space,guiding missiles toward unseen targets,while the human conductof the orchestra of media relationsin the event that this particular drone attackhits a villagerinstead of an extremist.It is a chess game.You learn to play an international relations schoolon your way out and upto national and international leadership.Checkmate.

zh-cn:我们完全忽略了战争的另一面我们忽略了我母亲的故事每一次警笛响起、袭击来临时每一次断电时她都会给我和哥哥表演手偶这样我们就不会对爆炸的声音感到害怕我们忽略了Fareeda的故事她是一个音乐老师在萨拉热窝教钢琴她保证她的音乐学校在四年的萨拉热窝围城中每一天都正常运转她每天走路去学校不管机枪如何瞄准她的学校和她自己保证钢琴、小提琴和大提琴在战争期间都被学生们带着手套、帽子，穿着大衣来弹奏。那是她的抗争那是她的抵抗我们忽略了Nehia的故事她是一名生活在加沙的巴勒斯坦女人她在去年战争停火的那一刻离开家门四处收集面粉并烘烤出足够所有邻居的面包以防第二天就不再有停火协议我们忽略了Violet的故事就算刚从教堂的种族屠杀中逃脱她依然继续埋葬尸体，清理房屋和街道我们忽略了那些女人的故事她们在战火中依旧维持生活运转你知道吗人们在战火中相爱去学校上课去工厂和医院工作离婚、跳舞、游乐努力生活下去而那些维持生活继续的是女人们
en:We are missinga completely other side of wars.We are missing my mother&#39;s story,who made sure with every siren, with every raid,with every cut off-of electricity,she played puppet shows for my brothers and I,so we would not be scaredof the sounds of explosions.We are missing the story of Fareeda,a music teacher,a piano teacher, in Sarajevo,who made surethat she kept the music school openevery single dayin the four years of besiege in Sarajevoand walked to that school,despite the snipers shootingat that school and at her,and kept the piano, the violin, the celloplaying the whole duration of the war,with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.That was her fight.That was her resistance.We are missing the story of Nehia,a Palestinian woman in Gazawho, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year&#39;s war,she left out of home,collected all the flourand baked as much bread for every neighbor to have,in case there is no cease-fire the day after.We are missingthe stories of Violet,who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre,she kept on going on,burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.We are missing stories of womenwho are literally keeping life goingin the midst of wars.Do you know —do you know that people fall in love in warand go to schooland go to factories and hospitalsand get divorced and go dancing and go playingand live life going?And the ones who are keeping that lifeare women.

zh-cn:战争是有两面性的有在战场上厮杀的一面也有维持学校工厂和医院运转的一面一面专注于如何赢得战斗另一面专注于如何赢得生活有讨论前线作战的一面也有一面在讨论后方的生活有一面认为和平就是战争的结束另一面则认为和平意味着安全抵达学校和工作地点有一面被男人们领导另一面则被女人们掌控为了让我们理解如何才能建立长久的和平我们必须从两方面来理解战争与和平我们必须对它有一个全局的认识
en:There are two sides of war.There is a side that fights,and there is a side that keeps the schoolsand the factories and the hospitals open.There is a side that is focused on winning battles,and there is a side that is focusedon winning life.There is a side that leads the front-line discussion,and there is a sidethat leads the back-line discussion.There is a side that thinksthat peace is the end of fighting,and there is a side that thinksthat peace is the arrivalof schools and jobs.There is a sidethat is led by men,and there is a sidethat is led by women.And in order for us to understandhow do we build lasting peace,we must understand war and peacefrom both sides.We must have a full pictureof what that means.

zh-cn:为了让我们理解到底什么才是和平我们需要明白的正如一个苏丹女人跟我说的那样“和平就是我的脚趾甲能重新长出来。”她在苏丹南部长大长达20年的战争造成一百万人的死亡五百万难民的流离失所许多女人被叛军和士兵当成奴隶她们被迫成为性奴同时还必须为士兵运送弹药、水和食物因此那个女人为了不被再次绑架20年间一直在四处逃难只有当和平开始到来时她的脚趾甲才能重新长出来我们需要从一个脚趾甲的角度来理解和平的意义
en:In order for us to understandwhat actually peace means,we need to understand,as one Sudanese woman once told me,&quot;Peace is the fact that my toenailsare growing back again.&quot;She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan,for 20 years of war,where it killed one million peopleand displaced five million refugees.Many women were taken as slavesby rebels and soldiers,as sexual slaves who were forced alsoto carry the ammunition and the waterand the food for the soldiers.So that woman walked for 20 years,so she would not be kidnapped again.And only when there was some sort of peace,her toenails grew back again.We need to understand peacefrom a toenail&#39;s perspective.

zh-cn:我们需要明白如果女人不能完全参与到谈判桌上我们实际上不可能有关于停战或和平的真正谈判我惊讶地发现在战争中，唯一一组没有战斗、没有杀戮没有掠夺、没有烧杀、没有强奸的人这组在战火中最努力虽然不是所有的人让生活在战火中继续的人却没有被接纳到谈判桌上我确实认为女人应领导关于后方的讨论但同时也有男人被排除在这个讨论之外那些没有参与战斗的医生那些艺术家、学生、拒绝拿起枪支的人他们也被排除在谈判桌外我们不可能谈论长久的和平民主建设、经济的可持续发展以及任何形式的稳定如果我们没有将女人完全包含进谈判桌上不仅仅是一个，而是一半
en:We need to understandthat we cannot actually have negotiationsof ending of wars or peacewithout fully including womenat the negotiating table.I find it amazingthat the only group of peoplewho are not fighting and not killingand not pillaging and not burning and not raping,and the group of people who are mostly —though not exclusively —who are keeping life going in the midst of war,are not included in the negotiating table.And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion,but there are also menwho are excluded from that discussion.The doctors who are not fighting,the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns,they are, too, excludedfrom the negotiating tables.There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace,building of democracy, sustainable economies,any kind of stabilities,if we do not fully include womenat the negotiating table.Not one, but 50 percent.

zh-cn:我们无法讨论如何建立稳定的局势如果我们不开始在女人和女孩身上投资你知道每年全世界的军费开支等于七百年的联合国预算也等于2928年的联合国的女性预算？如果我们将那笔开支用于上述两个方面那么或许我们能够拥有更为长久美好的和平最后同样重要的一点就是我们需要在和平和女人身上投资不仅因为这是一件正确的事情不仅因为这是为了建立可持续的和平而做的正确的事情这也是为了将来
en:There is no way we can talk about the building of stabilityif we don&#39;t start investingin women and girls.Did you knowthat one yearof the world&#39;s military spendingequals 700 yearsof the U.N. budgetand equals 2,928 yearsof the U.N. budget allocated for women?If we just reversethat distribution of funds,perhaps we could havea better lasting peace in this world.And last, but not least,we need to invest in peace and women,not only because it is the right thing to do,not only because it is the right thing to do,for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today,but it is for the future.

We helped her get a job.She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.She was sending them to school. Have a new home.She said, &quot;But what I worry about the mostis not any of that.I worry that my childrenhave hate in their hearts,and when they want to grow up, they want to fight againthe killers of their father and their brother.&quot;We need to invest in women,because that&#39;s our only chanceto ensure that there is no more warin the future.That mother has a better chance to heal her childrenthan any peace agreement can do.
