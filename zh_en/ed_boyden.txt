zh-cn:花点时间回想你的一天你清晨醒来，走出房门的时候感受到清风拂过你的脸颊巧遇新的同事，与其谈天说地当你发现新事物时则心怀敬畏但我确定今天会有些你没有想到的事情—一些如此贴近生活的但你可能完全忽略的事情。其中包含的所有的感知能力，感情决策和行动都直接受控于在你头部的电脑叫做大脑的部分。
en:Think about your day for a second.You woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door,encountered new colleagues and had great discussions,and felt in awe when you found something new.But I bet there&#39;s something you didn&#39;t think about today —something so close to homethat you probably don&#39;t think about it very often at all.And that&#39;s that all the sensations, feelings,decisions and actionsare mediated by the computer in your headcalled the brain.

zh-cn:大脑看可不像外表看起来那样—只是几磅桃灰色的肉块，非结晶的固体—但是经过上百年积淀的神经学让我们能进一步的研究大脑，并了解大脑的错综复杂。研究告诉我们大脑是由上千亿个神经元细胞组成的难以想象的复杂电路不同于人类设计的电脑那种由较少的不同元件组成的—我们了解它们如何工作，因为是我们人类设计出了它们—大脑由上千种不同的细胞组成也许是上万种它们分化成不同的形状；它们分泌出不同分子；它们延伸并连接大脑的不同地区。它们对于不同的疾病也表现出不同的方式。
en:Now the brain may not look like much from the outside —a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh,amorphous —but the last hundred years of neurosciencehave allowed us to zoom in on the brain,and to see the intricacy of what lies within.And they&#39;ve told us that this brainis an incredibly complicated circuitmade out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons.Now unlike a human-designed computer,where there&#39;s a fairly small number of different parts —we know how they work, because we humans designed them —the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells,maybe tens of thousands.They come in different shapes; they&#39;re made out of different molecules.And they project and connect to different brain regions,and they also change different ways in different disease states.

zh-cn:说的具体一点有一种细胞，一种较小的，抑制性细胞，能够抑制周围细胞。这是一种其萎缩能导致类似神经分裂症状的细胞这叫做篮细胞它是我们正在研究的成千上万种细胞中的一种每天都会有发现新型的细胞。第二个例子：这些锥体细胞，大型的细胞他们分布在大脑的很多部位它们易受刺激。其中的一部分细胞可能会因过度的活动而导致疾病类似癫症。这些细胞中每一个都是一个神奇的电子元件它们从上游细胞接收信息然后编辑出它们自己的输出信息，然后，如果这些信息通过了特定的界限，就会传递到下游上千个细胞那里。这个仅仅会花费一毫秒左右的时间的过程在你身上的每个1万亿个细胞中每分钟发生上千次，只要你活着思考着感受着。
en:Let&#39;s make it concrete.There&#39;s a class of cells,a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors.It&#39;s one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia.It&#39;s called the basket cell.And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cellthat we are learning about.New ones are being discovered everyday.As just a second example:these pyramidal cells, large cells,they can span a significant fraction of the brain.They&#39;re excitatory.And these are some of the cellsthat might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy.Every one of these cellsis an incredible electrical device.They receive input from thousands of upstream partnersand compute their own electrical outputs,which then, if they pass a certain threshold,will go to thousands of downstream partners.And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so,happens thousands of times a minutein every one of your 100 billion cells,as long as you liveand think and feel.

zh-cn:我们将如何解释这些回路的运作呢？主观上，我们能刺激这些回路把不同种细胞反复刺激看我们是否能了解哪种细胞作用于特定的功用哪种细胞出错会引起特定的病理如果我们能激活细胞，我们就能了解它们能释放哪种能量他们是如何启动和维持的.如果我们能把它们全部切断我们就可能弄清楚它们的必要性。这就是今天我要告诉大家的故事。老实说，我们试图寻找方法来控制大脑中的回路，细胞，部分的组织还有它的传输途径这不仅是对科学的探索，也是直面人类所面临的一些问题。
en:So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does?Ideally, we could go through the circuitand turn these different kinds of cell on and offand see whether we could figure outwhich ones contribute to certain functionsand which ones go wrong in certain pathologies.If we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash,what they can initiate and sustain.If we could turn them off,then we could try and figure out what they&#39;re necessary for.And that&#39;s a story I&#39;m going to tell you about today.And honestly, where we&#39;ve gone through over the last 11 years,through an attempt to find waysof turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brainon and off,both to understand the scienceand also to confront some of the issuesthat face us all as humans.

en:Now before I tell you about the technology,the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room,if we live long enough,will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.Already, a billion peoplehave had some kind of brain disorderthat incapacitates them,and the numbers don&#39;t do it justice though.These disorders — schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#39;s,depression, addiction —they not only steal our time to live, they change who we are.They take our identity and change our emotionsand change who we are as people.Now in the 20th century,there was some hope that was generatedthrough the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders,and while many drugs have been developedthat can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders,practically none of them can be considered to be cured.And part of that&#39;s because we&#39;re bathing the brain in the chemical.This elaborate circuitmade out of thousands of different kinds of cellis being bathed in a substance.That&#39;s also why, perhaps, most of the drugs, and not all, on the marketcan present some kind of serious side effect too.

en:Now some people have gotten some solacefrom electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain.And for Parkinson&#39;s disease,Cochlear implants,these have indeed been ableto bring some kind of remedyto people with certain kinds of disorder.But electricity also will go in all directions —the path of least resistance,which is where that phrase, in part, comes from.And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix.So again, we&#39;re sent back to the ideaof ultra-precise control.Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go?

zh-cn:当11年前我开始研究神经科学我受训成为一个电学工程师和物理学家而且第一件我想到的事如果这些神经元是电子元件所有我们要做的是找到某些方法在一定距离控制电流的变化如果我们能刺激单独一个细胞而不牵涉它周边那就我们就有了能激活和关闭各种不同细胞的工具了解它们的作用和他们如何作用在它们位于的脑部网络同样这给了我们需要的超精确控制来修复出错的回路如今我们将怎么做呢？自然中有很多分子能够把光转化为电流你可以把它们看做小蛋白质像太阳能细胞如果我们能用某种方法把这些分子注入到神经元中这些神经元就能转型成光控的电子元件那些周边的细胞，那些没有接受分子的，就不会转型另外还有一个你需要知道的小窍门，就是把光注入脑中。这么做—大脑不会感知到痛苦—你能—充分利用脑中类似互联网和沟通的功能—把光纤连接到激光束中以此来激活，比如说动物的细胞在潜伏期的研究中要了解这些神经元的功用
en:So when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago,I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist,and the first thing I thought about was,if these neurons are electrical devices,all we need to do is to find some wayof driving those electrical changes at a distance.If we could turn on the electricity in one cell,but not its neighbors,that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells,figure out what they do and how they contributeto the networks in which they&#39;re embedded.And also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we needin order to fix the circuit computationsthat have gone awry.Now how are we going to do that?Well there are many molecules that exist in nature,which are able to convert light into electricity.You can think of them as little proteinsthat are like solar cells.If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow,then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light.And their neighbors, which don&#39;t have the molecule, would not.There&#39;s one other magic trick you need to make this all happen,and that&#39;s the ability to get light into the brain.And to do that — the brain doesn&#39;t feel pain — you can put —taking advantage of all the effortthat&#39;s gone into the Internet and communications and so on —optical fibers connected to lasersthat you can use to activate, in animal models for example,in pre-clinical studies,these neurons and to see what they do.

zh-cn:那我们应该怎么做呢？大概在2004年在与格哈德·内格尔和卡尔·戴斯洛合作的时候假想得到了最终的成功自然界中有一种特定的海藻它就有趋光性来达到最理想的光合效果它用一个小眼点来感知光线但其工作原理和人眼大相径庭在它的细胞膜，或者它的边界含有少量的蛋白质能把光转化为电流这些分子被叫做槽型视紫质（TRB）这种蛋白质就像我告诉过你们的太阳能细胞那样运作当蓝光照射时，它会打开一个小口允许带点的微粒进入眼点中这样眼点就有了电信号就像是用太阳能细胞给电池充电一般
en:So how do we do this?Around 2004,in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth,this vision came to fruition.There&#39;s a certain alga that swims in the wild,and it needs to navigate towards lightin order to photosynthesize optimally.And it senses light with a little eye-spot,which works not unlike how our eye works.In its membrane, or its boundary,it contains little proteinsthat indeed can convert light into electricity.So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins.And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about.When blue light hits it, it opens up a little holeand allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot,and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signaljust like a solar cell charging up a battery.

zh-cn:我们需要做的就是提取这些分子然后用某种方法注入到神经元中同时因为这是蛋白质由生物的DNA编码而成所以我们所要做的就是提取DNA注入到基因载体上，比如病毒然后把病毒注入到神经元中结果证明基因载体是一个很直接的方法病毒长驱直入证实了操作的简易性在2004年夏天的一个早晨我们实物操作了一番，第一次尝试有了起效你提取出DNA并注入到神经元中神经元用它自身的蛋白质合成器来组装出这些小型的光敏蛋白质并使其分不到细胞各处就像在顶层架设太阳能板接下去你就有了个光敏的神经元这是个很有效的工具
en:So what we need to do is to take these moleculesand somehow install them in neurons.And because it&#39;s a protein,it&#39;s encoded for in the DNA of this organism.So all we&#39;ve got to do is take that DNA,put it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus,and put it into neurons.So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy,and lots of viruses were coming along.So this turned out to be very simple to do.And early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004,we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron.The neuron uses its natural protein-making machineryto fabricate these little light-sensitive proteinsand install them all over the cell,like putting solar panels on a roof,and the next thing you know,you have a neuron which can be activated with light.So this is very powerful.

zh-cn:你要做的步骤就是设法把这些基因注入到你需要的细胞内而不是其他周边的细胞你可以完成；你能转变这些病毒让它们只针对一些细胞而涉及到其他细胞还有其他基因方式能得到这种光敏细胞如今这领域叫做光遗传学举个例子来说明你要做的，你可以在一个复杂的网络系统利用一种病毒来传递这种基因在密集的细胞区域只针对一种细胞接着当你照射整个区域的时候只有那些特定的细胞被激活
en:One of the tricks you have to dois to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you wantand not all the other neighbors.And you can do that; you can tweak the virusesso they hit just some cells and not others.And there&#39;s other genetic tricks you can playin order to get light-activated cells.This field has now come to be known as optogenetics.And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do,you can take a complex network,use one of these viruses to deliver the genejust to one kind of cell in this dense network.And then when you shine light on the entire network,just that cell type will be activated.

zh-cn:比如说，用篮细胞来做例子会更简单一点就是那种萎缩导致精神分裂有抑制作用的细胞如果我们能把基因注入到这些细胞中—而且他们不会引起基因的表现型有所改变—接着用蓝光照射整个脑组织只有蓝细胞会被激活而当无光线的时候，这些细胞就变回普通的细胞没有产生不良的后果不仅你能了解到这些细胞的功用在大脑运作中它们的能效而且你也能尝试解决—也许我们可以激活这些细胞的活性，如果它们真的萎缩的话。
en:So for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier —the one that&#39;s atrophied in schizophreniaand the one that is inhibitory.If we can deliver that gene to these cells —and they&#39;re not going to be altered by the expression of the gene, of course —and then flash blue light over the entire brain network,just these cells are going to be driven.And when the light turns off, these cells go back to normal,so they don&#39;t seem to be averse against that.Not only can you use this to study what these cells do,what their power is in computing in the brain,but you can also use this to try to figure out —well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells,if indeed they&#39;re atrophied.

zh-cn:现在我想告诉你一些小故事关于我们怎么利用这技术的,在科学，临床阶段和临床前阶段的研究。在我们遭遇到的问题中有一个是，大脑用什么样的信号来代表奖励的感觉呢？因为如果我们找到的话那能够驱使细胞学习的信号大脑就会为了奖励竭尽全力同时也是这些出错的信号引起疾病类似成瘾症如果我们能够知道是哪些细胞的话我们可能就有新的靶细胞来专门设计或者挑选药物来对抗疾病或者找到植入电击器的位置来帮助那些有着严重残疾的病人为了做到这些，我们想出了一个简单的例子在菲奥雷拉集团的协助下在盒子的一边如果动物经过这里，就会被光波照射到来区别不同细胞对光的感应能力.那如果这些细胞是识别为被奖励的那动物就会多次的经过那里这就是大致的经过
en:Now I want to tell you a couple of short storiesabout how we&#39;re using this,both at the scientific, clinical and pre-clinical levels.One of the questions we&#39;ve confrontedis, what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward?Because if you could find those,those would be some of the signals that could drive learning.The brain will do more of whatever got that reward.And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction.So if we could figure out what cells they are,we could maybe find new targetsfor which drugs could be designed or screened against,or maybe places where electrodes could be put infor people who have very severe disability.So to do that, we came up with a very simple paradigmin collaboration with the Fiorella group,where one side of this little box,if the animal goes there, the animal gets a pulse of lightin order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light.So if these cells can mediate reward,the animal should go there more and more.And so that&#39;s what happens.

en:This animal&#39;s going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there,and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that.And he&#39;ll do that hundreds and hundreds of times.These are the dopamine neurons,which some of you may have heard about, in some of the pleasure centers in the brain.Now we&#39;ve shown that a brief activation of theseis enough, indeed, to drive learning.Now we can generalize the idea.Instead of one point in the brain,we can devise devices that span the brain,that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns —arrays of optical fibers,each coupled to its own independent miniature light source.And then we can try to do things in vivothat have only been done to-date in a dish —like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brainfor the signals that can cause certain things to happen.Or that could be good clinical targetsfor treating brain disorders.

zh-cn:另外一件我想说的事是我们如何寻找靶细胞来治疗创伤后应激障碍—这是一种不受控制的焦虑恐慌的症候群我们要做的一件事接受一个经典的恐怖模式那就回到了巴甫洛夫的时代也被称作巴甫洛夫恐惧条件反射在响声后的短暂电击电极并不疼痛，但是有点烦人久而久之—这里的例子，老鼠是一个很好的动物典型，在试验中广泛使用—动物学会去害怕响声会表现出呆滞的反应有点像鹿被车灯照射后的反应一样如今的问题是，大脑中哪些目标位置能让我们克服这种恐惧？我们所做的就是再一次播放那当已经和恐惧联系起来的响声但是我们激活大脑中的靶细胞，每次不同的位置利用光纤阵列来演示出之前那样的图片来尝试找出能让大脑克服恐惧记忆的靶细胞
en:And one story I want to tell you aboutis how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder —a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear.And one of the things that we didwas to adopt a very classical model of fear.This goes back to the Pavlovian days.It&#39;s called Pavlovian fear conditioning —where a tone ends with a brief shock.The shock isn&#39;t painful, but it&#39;s a little annoying.And over time — in this case, a mouse,which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments —the animal learns to fear the tone.The animal will react by freezing,sort of like a deer in the headlights.Now the question is, what targets in the brain can we findthat allow us to overcome this fear?So what we do is we play that tone againafter it&#39;s been associated with fear.But we activate targets in the brain, different ones,using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide,in order to try and figure out which targetscan cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear.

en:And so this brief videoshows you one of these targets that we&#39;re working on now.This is an area in the prefrontal cortex,a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states.And the animal&#39;s going to hear a tone — and a flash of light occurred there.There&#39;s no audio on this, but you can see the animal&#39;s freezing.This tone used to mean bad news.And there&#39;s a little clock in the lower left-hand corner,so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this.And now this next clipis just eight minutes later.And the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again.Okay, there it goes. Right now.And now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment,that we&#39;ve equipped the brain by photoactivating this areato overcome the expressionof this fear memory.

en:Now over the last couple of years, we&#39;ve gone back to the tree of lifebecause we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off.If we could do that, this could be extremely powerful.If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds,you can figure out what necessary role they playin the circuits in which they&#39;re embedded.And we&#39;ve now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life —every kingdom of life except for animals, we see slightly differently.And we found all sorts of molecules, they&#39;re called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins,that respond to green and yellow light.And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about beforewith the blue light activator channelrhodopsin.

en:Let&#39;s give an example of where we think this is going to go.Consider, for example, a condition like epilepsy,where the brain is overactive.Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment,one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain.But that&#39;s obviously irreversible, and there could be side effects.What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time,until the seizure dies away,and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state —sort of like a dynamical system that&#39;s being coaxed down into a stable state.So this animation just tries to explain this conceptwhere we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light,and we beam light in,and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure,we&#39;re hoping to be able to turn it off.And so we don&#39;t have data to show you on this front,but we&#39;re very excited about this.

en:Now I want to close on one story,which we think is another possibility —which is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultra-precise control,can be used in the brain itselfto make a new kind of prosthetic, an optical prosthetic.I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon.Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson&#39;s deep-brain stimulators implanted.Maybe 100,000 people have Cochlear implants,which allow them to hear.There&#39;s another thing, which is you&#39;ve got to get these genes into cells.And new hope in gene therapy has been developedbecause viruses like the adeno-associated virus,which probably most of us around this room have,and it doesn&#39;t have any symptoms,which have been used in hundreds of patientsto deliver genes into the brain or the body.And so far, there have not been serious adverse eventsassociated with the virus.

en:There&#39;s one last elephant in the room, the proteins themselves,which come from algae and bacteria and fungi,and all over the tree of life.Most of us don&#39;t have fungi or algae in our brains,so what is our brain going to do if we put that in?Are the cells going to tolerate it? Will the immune system react?In its early days — these have not been done on humans yet —but we&#39;re working on a variety of studiesto try and examine this,and so far we haven&#39;t seen overt reactions of any severityto these moleculesor to the illumination of the brain with light.So it&#39;s early days, to be upfront, but we&#39;re excited about it.

en:I wanted to close with one story,which we think could potentiallybe a clinical application.Now there are many forms of blindnesswhere the photoreceptors,our light sensors that are in the back of our eye, are gone.And the retina, of course, is a complex structure.Now let&#39;s zoom in on it here, so we can see it in more detail.The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top,and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptorsare transformed by various computationsuntil finally that layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells,relay the information to the brain,where we see that as perception.In many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa,or macular degeneration,the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed.Now how could you repair this?It&#39;s not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored,because there&#39;s nothing for the drug to bind to.On the other hand, light can still get into the eye.The eye is still transparent and you can get light in.So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other moleculesand install them on some of these other spare cellsand convert them into little cameras.And because there&#39;s so many of these cells in the eye,potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras.

en:So this is some work that we&#39;re doing.It&#39;s being led by one of our collaborators,Alan Horsager at USC,and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience,which is funded by the NIH.And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze.It&#39;s a six-arm maze. And there&#39;s a bit of water in the mazeto motivate the mouse to move, or he&#39;ll just sit there.And the goal, of course, of this mazeis to get out of the water and go to a little platformthat&#39;s under the lit top port.Now mice are smart, so this mouse solves the maze eventually,but he does a brute-force search.He&#39;s swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform.So he&#39;s not using vision to do it.These different mice are different mutationsthat recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans.And so we&#39;re being careful in trying to look at these different modelsso we come up with a generalized approach.

en:So how are we going to solve this?We&#39;re going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.We&#39;re going to take these blue light photosensorsand install them on a layer of cellsin the middle of the retina in the back of the eyeand convert them into a camera —just like installing solar cells all over those neuronsto make them light sensitive.Light is converted to electricity on them.So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experimentand received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus.And now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid wallsand go to this little platformand make cognitive use of its eyes again.And to point out the power of this:these animals are able to get to that platformjust as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives.So this pre-clinical study, I think,bodes hope for the kinds of thingswe&#39;re hoping to do in the future.

zh-cn:最后，我想指出我们正研究的一种针对神经科学这新领域的商业模式我们发明了这些工具但是我们愿意和全世界的人共同分享这样人们才能进一步研究并尝试治疗其他各种疾病我们希望，通过了解大脑的神经网络通过某种程度的手术，能让我们修复并设计神经网络我们会继续研究我之前讲过的几种疾病特别是那几种从未被治愈过的他们在21世纪将会成为历史
en:To close, I want to point out that we&#39;re also exploringnew business models for this new field of neurotechnology.We&#39;re developing these tools,but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world,so people can study and try to treat different disorders.And our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuitsat a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them,we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier,practically none of which are cured,and in the 21st century make them history.

zh-cn:Juan Enriquez(JE)：您的演讲有些深奥啊。（笑声）但是利用光来控制癫痫或者抽搐而不是用药物还要能够精确地控制靶细胞是第一步。据我所听到的，第二步是用两种色彩的光来控制大脑就好像开关一样
en:Juan Enriquez: So some of the stuff is a little dense.(Laughter)But the implicationsof being able to control seizures or epilepsywith light instead of drugs,and being able to target those specificallyis a first step.The second thing that I think I heard you sayis you can now control the brain in two colors,like an on/off switch.

zh-cn:艾德·博伊登(EB):没错.
en:Ed Boyden: That&#39;s right.

zh-cn:JE：这让每个大脑中的神经冲动变成二进制的代码
en:JE: Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code.

zh-cn:EB：是的当蓝灯亮起时，我们能传输信息。就类似于代码1等光关闭了，就类似代码0我们的希望是最终建造一个大脑协同处理器来和大脑一起运作以此来帮助那些有残疾的人
en:EB: Right, yeah.So with blue light, we can drive information, and it&#39;s in the form of a one.And by turning things off, it&#39;s more or less a zero.So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessorsthat work with the brainso we can augment functions in people with disabilities.

zh-cn:那就是理论上，这代表着老鼠的感觉，嗅觉听觉和触觉你都能把它整合到一串0和1
en:JE: And in theory, that means that,as a mouse feels, smells,hears, touches,you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros.

zh-cn:EB：的确是这样的。我们希望通过这种测试来确定哪种神经代码代表着哪种行为举止或者是想法或者感受通过这样来更多的了解大脑
en:EB: Sure, yeah. We&#39;re hoping to use this as a way of testingwhat neural codes can drive certain behaviorsand certain thoughts and certain feelings,and use that to understand more about the brain.

zh-cn:JE：这是不是意味着某天你能下载记忆或者上传记忆呢？
en:JE: Does that mean that some day you could download memoriesand maybe upload them?

zh-cn:EB：我们着手的某些工作是很复杂的我们还在继续的研究我们也在尝试去标记下这个大脑记录数据我们就能记录信息，并把信息传输回大脑—类似于了解什么是大脑所需的来增强它的信息处理效率.
en:EB: Well that&#39;s something we&#39;re starting to work on very hard.We&#39;re now working on some workwhere we&#39;re trying to tile the brain with recording elements too.So we can record information and then drive information back in —sort of computing what the brain needsin order to augment its information processing.

zh-cn:JE: 嗯，这会改变我的世界的。谢谢! (EB: 谢谢.)
en:JE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you. (EB: Thank you.)
