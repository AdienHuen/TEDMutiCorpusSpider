zh-cn:我曾经是这样一个小孩，每当我进入一辆车里，我基本上都要把车窗摇下来，因为通常车里面要么太热，要么太闷，或者是有很浓的味道，并且我父亲不允许我们用空调。他说这样会让引擎过热。你或者你们中的某些人或许会记得当时的汽车是什么样子的，当时汽车的通病就是容易过热而过热也是一种负额超载或者是过度使用高耗能的设备的表现
en:I was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car,I basically had to roll down the window.It was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly,and my father would not let us use the air conditioner.He said that it would overheat the engine.And you might remember, some of you,how the cars were back then, and it wasa common problem of overheating.But it was also the signal that capped the use,or overuse, of energy-consuming devices.

zh-cn:而现在这一切都变了。我们可以乘车跨越整个国家我们可以全程开空调并且我们现在根本不会遇到过热的问题所以现在已经没有告诉我们要停用汽车的信号了
en:Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.We blast the air conditioning the entire way,and we never experience overheating.So there&#39;s no more signal for us to tell us to stop.

zh-cn:很好吧 不是么? 我们的建筑其实有相似的问题在过去有空调之前 我们要砌一层很厚的墙厚墙是个很好的隔热材料 它可以保持墙的内部冬暖夏凉这些小窗子也是个不错的设计因为它限制了热量在墙内与墙外之间传递然后到了大约20世纪30年代 随着平板玻璃的到来冷轧钢技术的出现及大规模的生产 我们可以从天花板到地板都是玻璃 没有任何阻挡视线的东西还有我们逐渐依赖的机电冷却系统来降低那些晒烫了的房间随着时间的推移 房屋越建越高我们的工程学应用更好了 所以这些机械系统被大规模运用 而它们需要大量的能源去运转它们向空气排出大量的热所以你们中的某些人能够理解城市中的热岛效应就是城市的温度相比相比于附近的郊区和农村的要高的多但是我们仍然有些问题 当我们失去了能源之后我们不能开窗 所以这些建筑将不再适合居住 所以必须空置出来直到空调系统重新启动更差的是 当我们想要让这些建筑变成一个没有能量流入或者流出的状态 我们无法通过提高系统运转效率而达到目的我们需要寻找一些其他的东西 而我们之前有些作茧自缚了
en:Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings.In the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls.The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interiorvery cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime,and the small windows were also very good becauseit limited the amount of temperature transferbetween the interior and exterior.Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass,rolled steel and mass production, we were ableto make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views,and with that came the irreversible reliance onmechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces.Over time, the buildings got taller and bigger,our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systemswere massive. They require a huge amount of energy.They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere,and for some of you may understand the heat island effectin cities, where the urban areas are much more warmthan the adjacent rural areas,but we also have problems that, when we lose power,we can&#39;t open a window here, and sothe buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacantuntil that air conditioning system can start up again.Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildingsmove towards a net-zero energy state, we can&#39;t do itjust by making mechanical systems more and more efficient.We need to look for something else, and we&#39;ve gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.

zh-cn:所以我们应该这么做呢? 我们怎么才能把自己从自己挖的洞中救出来?如果我们从生物学来看 或许你们当中很多人都不知道在我学建筑之前 我曾经主修生物，人体皮肤是一个可以自然调控身体温度的器官 这点非常神奇它还是人体第一道防线它具有小孔 它有汗腺 它让所有这些高效协作 分工细致的各种小东西所以我想我们建筑的外表应该也跟人体皮肤相似根据不同的地点, 做出更加动态反应更加迅速 更加针对性的反馈
en:So what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig usout of this hole that we&#39;ve dug?If we look at biology, and many of you probably don&#39;t know,I was a biology major before I went into architecture,the human skin is the organ that naturally regulatesthe temperature in the body, and it&#39;s a fantastic thing.That&#39;s the first line of defense for the body.It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these thingsthat work together very dynamically and very efficiently,and so what I propose is that our building skinsshould be more similar to human skin,and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsiveand differentiated, depending on where it is.

zh-cn:然后再说回我的研究我提出首先应该寻找一个不同于现在的材料面板去做我现在正在研究某些智能材料和一些只能热双金属首先 我想我们称它为智能是因为它不需要控制或者能量这个是个建筑学里一件非常大的事情它是什么? 它是由两种不同的金属薄膜组成的薄板你可以看见这一面不同的反射因为它有两种不同系数的延展当他被加热的时候 一边会比另一边延展得快然后变成有一个弯曲的效果所以在早期的原型我建了些曲面来了解卷曲会如何对温度作出反应 还有可能让空气在系统中循环通风在其他原型中我做一种表面能够让多块这些东西绑在一起 能够在受热的情况下有更大的移动出现现在我们把这个装置放在Silver Lake（银湖）材料以及应用展览馆里非常近 而且它会在那里展览直到八月 你们可以去看一下。它叫做“bloom”，它的表面全是热双金属做的 它是让这个遮篷做这两件事情：第一 做成一个遮太阳的装置当太阳光射在它的表面时 它可以限制太阳光通过装置的量第二 它是一个通风系统这样被它困在下面的热空气可以在有需要的时候穿过或者离开这个装置
en:And this gets me back to my research.What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.I presently, or currently, work with smart materials,and a smart thermo-bimetal.First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requiresno controls and it requires no energy,and that&#39;s a very big deal for architecture.What it is, it&#39;s a lamination of two different metals together.You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.And because it has two different coefficients of expansion,when heated, one side will expand faster than the otherand result in a curling action.So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to seehow the curl would react to temperature and possibly allowair to ventilate through the system,and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicityof having these strips together can try to makebigger movement happen when also heated,and currently have this installation at the Materials &amp; Applications galleryin Silver Lake, close by, and it&#39;s there until August, if you want to see it.It&#39;s called &quot;Bloom,&quot; and the surface is made completelyout of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopythat does two things. One, it&#39;s a sun-shading device, so thatwhen the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through,and in other areas, it&#39;s a ventilating system,so that hot, trapped air underneath can actuallymove through and out when necessary.

zh-cn:你可以在这个快进的视频中看到太阳光和阴影 印在这个材料表面每一片材料 在各自移动记住 在我们现有的数字科技基础上这个材料是由大约1万4千片组成并且没有两块是一样的 每一片都不同它还有一个巨大的优点 就是我们可以校正每一片精确到它最理想的位置它面向太阳的角度 和这个材料是怎么弯曲的都达到最佳
en:You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun,as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade,each of the tiles moves individually.Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today,this thing was made out of about 14,000 piecesand there&#39;s no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrateeach one to be very, very specific to its location,to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls.

zh-cn:所以这种概念项目被证明有深远的影响对于未来建筑材料的应用还有就是在这件事一样 你看到的房子这是一名在中国的开发者发明的实际上它是一个四层的玻璃盒子因为我们想要看到它的里面 所以它依然是一个玻璃框但现在它被热双金属层护套保护一个屏幕环绕 并且那层热双金属层可以根据太阳移动进行开关此外，他可以遮挡隐私区域，这样可以把私人空间和公共空间在一天不同的时间区别开来这就说明 就像这个房子我们不再需要窗帘和百叶窗了因为我们可以在这栋建筑上挡住一些东西并能管理室内的空气清新的状况
en:So this kind of proof of concept projecthas a lot of implicationsto actual future application in architecture,and in this case, here you see a house,that&#39;s for a developer in China,and it&#39;s actually a four-story glass box.It&#39;s still with that glass box because we still want that visual access,but now it&#39;s sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer,it&#39;s a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actuallyopen and close as that sun moves around on that surface.In addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy,so that it can differentiate from some of the public areasin the space during different times of day.And what it basically implies is that, in houses now,we don&#39;t need drapes or shutters or blinds anymorebecause we can sheath the building with these things,as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.

zh-cn:我一直也在创造一个市场需要的建筑组成元素所以在这里你看到一个典型的双层玻璃窗在两层玻璃窗之间我打算做一个热双金属式的系统这样当太阳光照射到外层时它会加热两层玻璃中间的空隙 然后热双金属就会使其弯曲 然后它会在这栋建筑的某些区域如果必要的话挡住所有太阳光你可以想象 在这款应用中，一栋高楼的大板体系从一楼一直到三四十楼 整栋建筑的表面可能会在一天的不同时间有不同温度这取决于有太阳光照射的频率
en:I&#39;m also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market,and so here you see a pretty typicaldouble-glazed window panel, and in that panel,between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing,I&#39;m trying to work on makinga thermo-bimetal pattern systemso that when the sun hits that outside layerand heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetalwill begin to curl, and what actually will happen thenis it&#39;ll start to block out the sunin certain areas of the building,and totally, if necessary.And so you can imagine, even in this application, thatin a high-rise building where the panel systems gofrom floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surfacecould be differentiated at different times of daydepending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface.

zh-cn:还有 这些是我现在在做的研究把热双金属应用到 你可以看见在右下角 有一些红色的 它实际上是小片的热双金属 并且它可以我们也在想办法让它像细菌的鞭毛或者我们的眼睫毛一样动
en:And these are some later studies that I&#39;m working onright now that are on the boards, where you can see,in the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it&#39;s actuallysmaller pieces of thermometal, and it&#39;s actually going to,we&#39;re trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes.

zh-cn:最后一项也是组成部分中的一个如果你注意到的话 我的专长之一就是生物学这个想法源于蚱蜢的身体构造蚱蜢有一套完全不同的呼吸系统它们通过身体侧面的呼吸孔来呼吸这些呼吸孔让空气进入并且通过系统达到降温的目的所以在这个项目中 我尝试着怎么也把它应用到建筑中去 我们怎样可以让空气从建筑的侧面进入到建筑内部你可以看到在早期对多层建筑的研究中发现这些孔实际上让空气进入的地方这是在使用热双金属之前这是在使用热双金属之后 抱歉这个有点难看明白 不过在表面上你可以看见红色的箭头左边的图显示 当空气是冷的时候 热双金属是平的所以它将限制空气从每层中间穿过而右图上显示热双金属弯曲让空气从中穿过 这就是两个我正在做的项目 在这里我再次强调这是一个跟以往完全不同的东西 因为你可以想象空气可以在墙内流动而不是打开窗户
en:This last project is also of components.The influence — and if you have noticed, one of myspheres of influence is biology — is from a grasshopper.And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles,and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down,and so in this project, I&#39;m trying to look at how we canconsider that in architecture too, how we can bringair through holes in the sides of a building.And so you see here some early studies of blocks,where those holes are actually coming through,and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied,and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it&#39;s a littlehard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.On the left, it&#39;s when it&#39;s cold and the thermo-bimetalis flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks,and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curlsand allows that air to pass through, so those are two differentcomponents that I&#39;m working on, and again,it&#39;s a completely different thing, because you can imaginethat air could potentially be coming through the wallsinstead of opening windows.

zh-cn:所以我想在最后再讲一点这个工程或者说这类智能材料当你对开关百叶窗厌烦时尤其是一天又一天的重复 或者是你在度假时没有人可以去控制百叶窗的开关或者在停电时和你没有可用的电力时 这些热双金属还是会继续高效工作直到永远 谢谢！（掌声）（掌声）
en:So I want to leave you with one last impression aboutthe project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.When you&#39;re tired of opening and closing those blindsday after day, when you&#39;re on vacationand there&#39;s no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls,or when there&#39;s a power outage, and you haveno electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetalswill still be working tirelessly, efficientlyand endlessly. Thank you. (Applause)(Applause)
