zh-cn:很久很久以前19世纪的德国有本书那时候这是故事书中的王者故事书很珍贵但又无处不在又有点无趣因为在有故事书的四百年里讲故事的人们从来没有改良故事书作为辅助设备后来有个作家他永远地改写了历史（音乐）他叫罗萨罗萨･梅根多尔弗尔罗萨･梅根多尔弗尔下了决心他说：“我受够了！”他抓起笔抄起剪刀他决意不走寻常路他折起了纸历史上的罗萨･梅根多尔弗尔作为什么人被记载下来？世界上第一个为孩子发明立体书的人（音乐）人们享受着这喜悦和惊奇（欢呼）他们很高兴故事保存下来世界继续转动
en:Once upon a timein 19th century Germany,there was the book.Now during this time,the book was the king of storytelling.It was venerable.It was ubiquitous.But it was a little bit boring.Because in its 400 years of existence,storytellers never evolved the bookas a storytelling device.But then one author arrived,and he changed the game forever.(Music)His name was Lothar,Lothar Meggendorfer.Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down,and he said, &quot;Genug ist genug!&quot;He grabbed his pen,he snatched his scissors.This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcyand just decided to fold.History would know Lothar Meggendorferas — who else? —the world&#39;s first true inventorof the children&#39;s pop-up book.(Music)For this delight and for this wonder,people rejoiced.(Cheering)They were happy because the story survived,and that the world would keep on spinning.

zh-cn:罗萨･梅根多尔弗尔不是第一个改进讲故事方法的人也不会是最后一个不管讲故事的人是否意识到当他们从歌剧到杂技从电台新闻到电台剧院从影像到电影到有声电影，彩色电影和3D电影从家用录像到DVD 他们都是在传承梅根多尔弗尔的精神没有什么能阻止梅根多尔弗尔的精神
en:Lothar Meggendorfer wasn&#39;t the firstto evolve the way a story was told,and he certainly wasn&#39;t the last.Whether storytellers realized it or not,they were channeling Meggendorfer&#39;s spiritwhen they moved opera to vaudville,radio news to radio theater,film to film in motionto film in sound, color, 3D,on VHS and on DVD.There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.

zh-cn:互联网的问世则带来了更多的乐趣（笑声）因为人们不但可以向世界讲述他们的故事而且可以利用各种各样的设备来讲故事比如 有个公司通过它的搜索引擎讲述一个爱情故事一个台湾工作室把美国政治做成3D动画（笑声）有个人通过一个叫做推特的平台讲述他父亲的故事分享他父亲说的无用废话
en:And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.(Laughter)Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world,but they could do sousing what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.For example, one companywould tell a story of lovethrough its very own search engine.One Taiwanese production studiowould interpret American politics in 3D.(Laughter)And one man would tell the stories of his fatherby using a platform called Twitterto communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.

zh-cn:在有了这一切之后 人们停下脚步回望过去他们意识到 在六千年讲故事的历史中他们从在洞穴墙壁上画狩猎图到在脸书的涂鸦墙上诠释莎士比亚这是让我们庆祝的原因讲故事的艺术没有改变大部分故事流传下来但是人们讲故事的方法已经通过不断创新不停地改进
en:And after all this, everyone paused;they took a step back.They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling,they&#39;ve gone from depicting hunting on cave wallsto depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.And this was a cause for celebration.The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.And for the most part, the stories are recycled.But the way that humans tell the storieshas always evolvedwith pure, consistent novelty.

zh-cn:人们会记住一个人一个伟大的德国人每一次一个新的讲故事的设备问世都会想起他由此观众们可爱美丽的观众们也从此永远幸福快乐地生活在一起（掌声）
en:And they remembered a man,one amazing German,every time a new storytelling devicepopped up next.And for that,the audience —the lovely, beautiful audience —would live happily ever after.(Applause)
