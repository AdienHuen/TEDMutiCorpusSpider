zh-cn:大家好，我是哈桑，我是个艺术家通常当我介绍自己说是艺术家的时候他们看着我说：“你画画吗？”或者“你在什么媒体行业工作？”我的大部分工作是关于工作的方法而非具体的一个学科分支或者具体的技术部门我真正感兴趣的是创造性地解决问题几年前我遇到点小麻烦下面就给各位讲讲
en:Hi there. I&#39;m Hasan. I&#39;m an artist.And usually when I tell people I&#39;m an artist,they just look at me and say, &quot;Do you paint?&quot;or &quot;What kind of medium do you work in?&quot;Well most of my work that I work withis really a little bit about methodologies of workingrather than actually a specific disciplineor a specific technique.So what I&#39;m really interested in is creative problem solving.And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.So let me show you a little of that.

zh-cn:是这样的这是2002年6月19日在底特律机场我刚从一个海外展会回到美国我回来的时候一个FBI特工把我带进了一个小房间问了我很多问题——“你去哪儿了？干了些什么？接触过什么人？为什么去那儿？谁给你的行程付钱？”——都是这样的细节接着突然地那个人问我：“9月12号你去哪儿了？”我们大部分人被问道“你9月12号去哪儿了”这样的问题或者其他日子会说“我不记得了，让我查查看。”
en:So it started over here.And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.And as I was coming back,well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent,and went into a little roomand he asked me all sorts of questions —&quot;Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?&quot; —all these little details.And then literally just out of nowhere,the guy asks me, &quot;Where were you September 12th?&quot;And when most of us get asked, &quot;Where were you September 12th?&quot;or any date for that fact,it&#39;s like, &quot;I don&#39;t exactly remember, but I can look it up for you.&quot;

zh-cn:我就拿出我的掌上电脑说：“让我查查9月12号的行程”我查了——10点到10点半我付了储藏室账单10点半到12点，见了我当时一个叫朱迪思的研究生12点到下午3点，上了入门课下午3点到6点，上了高级课“11号你去哪儿了？” “10号呢？”“29号那天你在哪儿？” “30号那天在哪儿？”“10月5号你在哪儿？”我们一共读了大约6个月的行程我估计他没料到我有这么详细的行程纪录还好我这么做了估计我穿囚服不怎么好看
en:So I pulled out my little PDA,and I said, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s look up my appointments for September 12th.&quot;I had September 12th — from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time.From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class,3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.&quot;Where were you the 11th?&quot; &quot;Where were you the 10th?&quot;&quot;Where were you the 29th? the 30th?&quot;&quot;Where were you October 5th?&quot;We read about six months of my calendar.And I don&#39;t think he was expecting me to have such detailed recordsof what I did.But good thing I did,because I don&#39;t look good in orange.

zh-cn:他问我——（掌声）“那你租的那个储藏室都在里头放什么了？”那是在弗罗里达的坦帕我说：“在弗罗里达用不上的冬衣放不进屋子的家具就是些整理的旧货杂物因为我是个整理狂。”他很迷惑地看着我说：“没炸药？”（笑声）我说：“当然没有，我敢保证没有炸药要是有的话，我肯定会记得的。”他还是有点迷惑我觉得任何一个人和我谈上几句就会发现我不是个恐怖分子我们坐在那儿经过了大约一个半小时的反复问讯他说：“我掌握足够信息了。我会把这个移交给坦帕办公室，是他们捅的摊子。他们会接手的，我们会负责。”我说：“很好。”
en:So he asked me —(Applause)&quot;So this storage unit that you paid the rent on,what did you have in it?&quot;This was in Tampa, Florida,so I was like, &quot;Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.Furniture that I can&#39;t fit in my ratty apartment.Just assorted garage sale junk,because I&#39;m a pack rat.&quot;And he looks at me really confused and says, &quot;No explosives?&quot;(Laughter)I was like, &quot;No, no. I&#39;m pretty certain there were no explosives.And if there were, I would have remembered that one.&quot;And he&#39;s still a little confused,but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutesrealizes I&#39;m not exactly a terrorist threat.And so we&#39;re sitting there,and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth,he says, &quot;Okay, I have enough information here.I&#39;m going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They&#39;re the ones who initiated this.They&#39;ll follow up with you, and we&#39;ll take care of it.&quot;I was like, &quot;Great.&quot;

zh-cn:我回到家，手机响了一个人跟我介绍说他是坦帕的一个FBI我在坦帕前前后后间断地待了有6个月另外你们知道吗，在美国你是不能拍联邦大楼的照片的但是谷歌做到了所以得谢谢谷歌的同志们（掌声）我有很多时间泡在了这栋楼里回答这些问题：“你是否曾目击或参与过任何可能危害美国或其他国家的活动？”回答这些问题的时候你得考虑心里状态因为你面对的是一个能决定生死的人或是这样的问题－测谎的问题他们一连问了我九个测谎问题——
en:So I got home and the phone rings,and a man introduced himself.Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampawhere I spent six months of my life —back and forth, not six months continuously.By the way, you folks know that in the United States,you can&#39;t take photographs of federal buildings,but Google can do it for you.So to the folks from Google, thank you.(Applause)So I spent a lot of time in this building.Questions like:&quot;Have you ever witnessed or participated in any actthat may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?&quot;And you also have to consider the state of mind you&#39;re inwhen you&#39;re doing this.You&#39;re basically face-to-face with someonethat essentially decides life or death.Or questions such as — actually, during the polygraph,which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them —
时间： 3:32
zh-cn:一个是...第一个是“你的名字是哈桑吗？” “是的。”“我们是在弗罗里达吗？” “是的。” “今天是星期二吗？” “是的”因为得让你回答判断问题接下来当然就是：“你属于任何可能危害美国的组织吗？”我在大学教书（笑声）我说，“你可能得直接问问我的同事了。”他们说：“好吧，先不管我们的讨论的你是否属于任何想要危害美国的组织？”我说不
en:one of the polygraph questions was ...well the first one was, &quot;Is your name Hasan?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;&quot;Are we in Florida?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Is today Tuesday?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;Because you have to base it on a yes or no.Then, of course, the next question is:&quot;Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?&quot;I work at a university.(Laughter)So I was like, &quot;Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly.&quot;But they said, &quot;Okay, aside from what we had discussed,do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?&quot;I was like, &quot;No.&quot;
时间： 4:02
zh-cn:在这样的6个月和9个测谎问题后他们说“一些都没有问题”我说“没错，这正是我这么久以来一直告诉你们的，我知道一切都没有问题。”他们很奇怪的看着我我说“我经常旅行”这是我跟FBI说的我想“只希望在全国范围都搞清楚这件事不然又得再来这一套。”这是我真正担心的他说：“你要有什么麻烦，给我打个电话－我们会搞定的。”
en:So at the end of six months of thisand nine consecutive polygraphs,they said, &quot;Hey, everything&#39;s fine.&quot;I was like, &quot;I know. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to tell you guys all along.I know everything&#39;s fine.&quot;So they&#39;re looking at me really odd.And it&#39;s like, &quot;Guys, I travel a lot.&quot;This is with the FBI.And I was like, &quot;All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo,and here we go all over again.&quot;And there was a sincere concern there.And he was like, &quot;You know, if you get into trouble,give us a call — we&#39;ll take care of it.&quot;
时间： 4:29
zh-cn:自那以后，去哪儿我都会打电话告诉FBI我告诉他们“嗨，我要出发啦，这是我的航班，3月12号西北航空去西雅图之类的几周以后，我会再打电话告诉他们并不是我被强制这么做，而是我选择这么做只是想告诉他们“我可没想搞什么小动作”（笑声）“我可不想让你们觉得我准备逃命了只是想让你们知道，有所准备”于是我就一直一直这样做然后电话变成电子邮件电子邮件变的越来越长...附插图还有旅游贴士接着我做了个网站我建了个这样的网站，让我们看看这个
en:So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.I would tell them, &quot;Hey guys, this is where I&#39;m going. This is my flight.Northwest flight seven coming into Seattleon March 12th&quot; or whatever.A couple weeks later, I&#39;d call again, let them know.It wasn&#39;t that I had to, but I chose to.Just wanted to say, &quot;Hey guys.Don&#39;t want to make it look like I&#39;m making any sudden moves.&quot;(Laughter)&quot;I don&#39;t want you guys to think that I&#39;m about to flee.Just letting you know. Heads up.&quot;And so I just kept doing this over and over and over.And then the phone calls turned into emails,and the emails got longer and longer and longer ...with pictures,with travel tips.Then I&#39;d make websites.And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here.

zh-cn:我是在2003年设计了它能追踪我的特定时刻行程我给手机程序写了代码我决定，你们不是要监视我吗，没问题我监视我自己，好了吧你们不用浪费精力浪费资源我帮你都干了于是在这个过程中我开始思考，他们还知道我的什么信息？他们应该知道我的飞行纪录吧于是我决定把所有的飞行纪录都放上去你看，Delta 1252从堪萨斯城飞往亚特兰大这是我在飞机上吃的几餐这是在Delta 719从肯尼迪机场飞往旧金山看吧，他们不让你把这个（刀子）带上飞机但是他们在飞机上给你这个（笑声）这是些我去过的机场因为我喜欢机场这是肯尼迪机场，5月19日，星期二这是华沙新加坡 你看这些地方基本空的
en:So I actually designed this back in 2003.So this kind of tracks me at any given moment.I wrote some code for my mobile phone.Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that&#39;s cool.But I&#39;ll watch myself. It&#39;s okay.You don&#39;t have to waste your energy or your resources.And I&#39;ll help you out.So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?Well they probably have all my flight records,so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.So you can see, Delta 1252going from Kansas City to Atlanta.And then you see, these are some of the meals that I&#39;ve been fed on the planes.This was on Delta 719going from JFK to San Francisco.See that? They won&#39;t let me on a plane with that,but they&#39;ll give it to me on the plane.(Laughter)These are the airports that I hang out in,because I like airports.That&#39;s Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday.This is in Warsaw.Singapore. You can see, they&#39;re kind of empty.

zh-cn:这是照片都是随便拍的不分时地但是如果你如果和其他数据交叉比较就能想FBI特工一样把这些信息整合起来当你得证实每一秒钟的活动时你就处在一种完全不同的生活状态种当这一切进行时我脑中就想着“艺术项目”不是想“啊，我有新的工作”但是经历这一切，明白了发生的事情，把所有的细节放到一起这种探索自我的方式最后确实变成了这个项目
en:These images are shot really anonymouslyto the point where it could be anyone.But if you can cross-reference this with the other data,then you&#39;re basically replaying the roll of the FBI agentand putting it all together.And when you&#39;re in a situationwhere you have to justify every moment of your existence,you&#39;re put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.At the time that this was going on,the last thing on my mind was &quot;art project.&quot;I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened?And after piecing together this, this and this,this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myselfeventually evolved into this,and it actually became this project.

zh-cn:这些是我去过购物的一些商店因为他们需要知道这些这是我买的鸭酱这是10月15日在达利市的牧场路99号在一家韩国超市买泡菜 因为我喜欢泡菜在那儿我还买了一些蟹在埃默里维尔的西夫韦买了点猪肠还有洗衣剂 在西奥克兰买的洗衣剂－不好意思，东奥克兰腌海蜇皮这是在东布伦瑞克的18号路上的香港超市如果你查看我的银行纪录会看到这些5月9日我从巴列霍的西夫韦加了14.79美元的油
en:So these are the stores that I shop in — some of them —because they need to know.This is me buying some duck flavored pasteat the Ranch 99 in Daly Cityon Sunday, November 15th.At Coreana Supermarketbuying my kimchi because I like kimchi.And I bought some crabs too right around there,and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland —East Oakland, sorry.And then my pickled jellyfishat the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.Now if you go to my bank records,it&#39;ll actually show something from there,so you know that, on May 9th,that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo.

zh-cn:如此一来不但是我提供信息还加入了第三方独立第三方，我的银行它给我作证，我确实在那这些点就有了交叉参考也就有了旁证有时候是很小额的购买34美分的外汇费用这是都是直接从我的银行帐户提取的每一条都立刻显示出来
en:So not only that I&#39;m giving this information here and there,but now there&#39;s a third party,an independent third party, my bank,that&#39;s verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.So there&#39;s points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.And there&#39;s a verification taking place.Sometimes they&#39;re really small purchases.So 34 cents foreign transaction fee.All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts,and everything pops up right away.

zh-cn:有时候信息量很大这是我在旧金山的旧公寓有时候是这个有时候只是盐湖城一个空空的走廊1月22日我能说出同行的人，地点因为向FBI我就得做到这样我得告诉他们每一个细节我花很多时间在路上这是内华达州埃尔克的一个停车场80号路8月19号晚上八点零一还有很多时间是在加油站－空空的火车站因此有多个数据库还有成千上万的照片我这个网站上有四万六千张照片FBI看过全部照片－至少我相信他们都看过有时候没什么信息只是张空床有时候很多文字信息但没有图片信息有时候是这个这是加利福利亚我最喜欢的三明治点越南三明治
en:Sometimes there&#39;s a lot of information.This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.And then sometimes you get this.Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City,January 22nd.And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was,because this is what I had to do with the FBI.I had to tell them every little detail of everything.I spend a lot of time on the road.This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevadaoff of Route 80at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th.I spend a lot of time in gas stations too — empty train stations.So there&#39;s multiple databases.And there&#39;s thousands and thousands and thousands of images.There&#39;s actually 46,000 images right now on my site,and the FBI has seen all of them —at least I trust they&#39;ve seen all of them.And then sometimes you don&#39;t get much information at all,you just get this empty bed.And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.So you get something like this.This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California —Vietnamese sandwich.

zh-cn:这些是不同的分类外出用餐空荡荡的火车站，空荡荡的加油站这些是我在家做的饭你怎么知道这些是在家用餐呢？因为这个碟子重复出镜了很多次你得作点侦探工作有时候这些数据非常特定化这些是在墨西哥城我吃掉的玉米饼是在一个火车站附近从7月15日到16日中午11点39分是这个下午1点56分是这个，晚上4点59分是这个每隔一会儿我就纪录下我的生活每隔一会儿我就拍照片
en:So there&#39;s different categorizationsof meals eaten outsideempty train stations, empty gas stations.These are some of the meals that I&#39;ve been cooking at home.So how do you know these are meals eaten at home?Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.So again, you have to do some detective work here.So sometimes the databases get so specific.These are all tacos eaten in Mexico Citynear a train stationon July fifth to July sixth.At 11:39 a.m. was this one.At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one.So I time-stamp my life every few moments.Every few moments I shoot the image.

zh-cn:都是拿iPhone拍的直接传到我的服务器上服务器进行后台操作并分类排放他们要知道我在干什么因为他们想知道12月4日我去了这儿2009年6月14日星期日下午两点在缅因州的Skowhegan，我的公寓在那儿你这儿能看到是一点一滴的信息
en:Now it&#39;s all done on my iPhone,and it all goes straight up to my server,and my server does all the backend workand categorizes things and puts everything together.They need to know where I&#39;m doing my business,because they want to know about my business.So on December 4th, I went here.And on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 —this was actually about two o&#39;clock in the afternoonin Skowhegan, Maine — this was my apartment there.So what you&#39;re basically seeing hereis all bits and pieces and all this information.
时间： 9:59
zh-cn:如果你去我的网站，都是大量的这样的信息而且这不是个用户友好的界面可以说用户不友好原因之一，也是使用不便的之一是网站的一切你得费力查看我把所有的信息放上去意味着我告诉你了我的一切但是尽管我把这一切完全公开我仍然过着非常匿名的隐私的生活你知道我的很少因此我得出这样的结论保护你隐私的方法在这个一切被分类一切被归档一切被纪录的时代里没有必要删除信息
en:If you go to my site, there&#39;s tons of things.And really, it&#39;s not the most user-friendly interface.It&#39;s actually quite user-unfriendly.And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness,is that everything is there,but you have to really work through it.So by me putting all this information out there,what I&#39;m basically telling you is I&#39;m telling you everything.But in this barrage of noisethat I&#39;m putting out,I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.And you know very little about me actually.And really so I&#39;ve come to the conclusionthat the way you protect your privacy,particularly in an era where everything is catalogedand everything is archived and everything is recorded,there&#39;s no need to delete information anymore.
时间：10:46
zh-cn:当所有信息都暴露的时候你怎么办？你得控制它如果我直接给你信息这跟你尝试获取信息片段是非常不同的方式还有个有趣的是特工们——这跟他们是谁无关——他们运作的产业是基于信息作为产品或者说获取信息的受约束性途径他们的信息具有价值的原因是因为别人没有办法获取它当我去掉中间环节直接将信息提供给你FBI拥有的信息就毫无用处了这就使他们贬值了这从个人层面来说这是纯粹是象征性的但是如果300百万美国人都这么做的话我们就得完全重新设计情报系统因为如果每个人都分享信息的话情报系统就瘫痪了而我们正在靠近
en:So what do you do when everything is out there?Well you have to take control over it.And if I give you this information directly,it&#39;s a very different type of identitythan if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.The other thing that&#39;s also interesting that&#39;s going on hereis the fact that intelligence agencies —and it doesn&#39;t matter who they are —they all operate in an industrywhere their commodity is information,or restricted access to information.And the reason their information has any valueis, well, because no one else has access to it.And by me cutting out the middle manand giving it straight to you,the information that the FBI has has no value,so thus devaluing their currency.And I understand that, on an individual level,it&#39;s purely symbolic.But if 300 million people in the U.S.started doing this,we would have to redesign the entire intelligence systemfrom the ground up.Because it just wouldn&#39;t work if everybody was sharing everything.And we&#39;re getting to that.

zh-cn:当我开始这个项目的时候人们看着我说“你干嘛想让全世界都知道你在哪儿干什么？”“你干吗要把照片都传上去？”这还是人们没开始用推特的时候现在7.5亿人在修改状态或给别人打招呼某种程度上说我很高兴我完全过时了我还在做这个项目，但完全过时了因为你们都在这么做这是我们每天都在做的事情虽然我们也许没有意识到我们在创造自己的档案
en:When I first started this project,people were looking at me and saying,&quot;Why would you want to tell everybody what you&#39;re doing, where you&#39;re at?Why are you posting these photos?&quot;This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhereand 750 million peoplewere posting status messagesor poking people.So in a way, I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m completely obsolete.I&#39;m still doing this project, but it is obsolete,because you&#39;re all doing it.This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis,whether we&#39;re aware of it or not.So we&#39;re creating our own archives and so on.

zh-cn:我的一些朋友总说“你太疑心病了，干吗总做这些？因为没人在看你没人会在乎你的。”我做的一件事是仔细的通过服务器查看浏览日志因为这是监视我得看看谁在监视我我找到了这些这些是部分样本仅仅是这些片段，你可以看到些东西我把单子缩减你们可以看到可以看见国土安全部喜欢造访这里国土安全部还有国家安全局也来过我实际上搬到了离他们很近的地方 我和他们住同一条街中央情报安全局总统办公室不明白他们问什么来，不过他们来了我想他们可能喜欢艺术很高兴我们有那个领域的赞助人
en:And you know, some of my friends have always said,&quot;Hey, you&#39;re just paranoid. Why are you doing this?Because no one&#39;s really watching.No one&#39;s really going to bother you.&quot;So one of the things that I dois I actually look through my server logs very carefully.Because it&#39;s about surveillance.I&#39;m watching who&#39;s watching me.And I came up with these.So these are some of my sample logs.And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by —Department of Homeland Security.You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.Central Intelligence Agency.Executive Office of the President.Not really sure why they show up, but they do.I think they kind of like to look at art.And I&#39;m glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields.

en:HE: Almost none.It&#39;s no differentthan sending a text.It&#39;s no different than checking an email.It&#39;s one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.So it&#39;s just become another day.I mean, when we update a status message,we don&#39;t really think about how long that&#39;s going to take.So it&#39;s really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks,send, and then it&#39;s done.And everything&#39;s automated at the other end.
