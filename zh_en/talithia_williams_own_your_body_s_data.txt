zh-cn:我从小就很喜欢从数据中取得信息和从数字中发现不为人知的故事我现在还记得从小父母就常用数字骗我给我带来的不开心“塔莉西亚，这话再说一遍我就已经说了一千次了”不，爸爸，你只说过17次其中两次还不是我的错（笑声）
en:As a kid I always loved informationthat I could get from dataand the stories that could be told with numbers.I remember, growing up, I&#39;d be frustrated athow my own parents would lie to me using numbers.&quot;Talithia, if I&#39;ve told you once I&#39;ve told you a thousand times.&quot;No dad, you&#39;ve only told me 17 timesand twice it wasn&#39;t my fault. (Laughter)

zh-cn:我想这是为什么我去念了统计学博士的原因之一我总是想知道人们在数字背后隐藏了什么秘密作为统计学家我总是要求人们给我看数据然后我自己来做出判断当我怀着我的第三个孩子的时候我已经41周半了在座有些人可能会觉得我已经超预产期了在统计学上我们说这还在95%置信区间（笑声）在这段时间我们需要每隔两天去做一次胎儿压力检查这是例行公事用来检测胎儿是否感受到了过大的压力通常你很少会碰到你自己的大夫谁在那天值班就是谁看诊所以在我们去做了压力测试20分钟之后，医生出来跟我们说“你的孩子压力过大，我们需要引产。”现在，作为统计学家，你猜我会怎么说？“给我看数据！”于是他就告诉我胎儿过去18分钟的心率数据是正常的最后两分钟的心率看起来更像是我自己的心率范围，于是我说“有没有可能那是我的心率？我刚才下来走了走让一个41周的孕妇平躺20分钟不动是有点难的可能胎儿也因此动了动。”他说，“嗯，我们不想出任何差错。”我说，“好。如果我现在是36周，也是这个数据你也会建议我引产吗？”“嗯，不会，我会等到你至少38周不过你先已经快42周了没有理由还让胎儿在里面让我来帮你准备产房。”我说，“那么，让我们再做一次检查吧？我们可以拿到更多的数据我可以尝试坚持平躺20分钟不动我们可以把两次结果取平均值再看看结果如何？“（笑声）他听了之后说“女士，我只是不希望你流产。”我们当然都不希望如此他继续说“当你过了预产期还没有生产的时候，你发生流产的可能性就提高了一倍。我们开始吧。”哇。这时，作为统计学家我是什么反应呢？给我看数据！老兄，你跟我谈概率我天天都跟概率打交道，要跟我谈概率我们就来谈概率吧 （笑声）我们来谈概率
en:I think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics.I always wanted to know,what are people trying to hide with numbers?As a statistician,I want people to show me the dataso I can decide for myself.Donald and I were pregnant with our third childand we were at about 41 and a half weeks,what some of you may refer to as being overdue.Statisticians, we call thatbeing within the 95 percent confidence interval.(Laughter)And at this point in the processwe had to come in every couple of daysto do a stress test on the baby,and this is just routine,it tests whether or not the baby is feeling any type of undue stress.And you are rarely, if ever, seen by your actual doctor,just whoever happens to be working at the hospital that day.So we go in for a stress test and after 20 minutesthe doctor comes out and he says,&quot;Your baby is under stress, we need to induce you.&quot;Now, as a statistician, what&#39;s my response?Show me the data!So then he proceeds to tell usthe baby&#39;s heart rate trace went from 18 minutes,the baby&#39;s heart rate was in the normal zoneand for two minutes it was in what appeared to bemy heart rate zone and I said,&quot;Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate?I was moving around a little bit,it&#39;s hard to lay still on your back,41 weeks pregnant for 20 minutes.Maybe it was shifting around.&quot;He said, &quot;Well, we don&#39;t want to take any chances.&quot;I said okay.I said, &quot;What if I was at 36 weekswith this same data?Would your decision be to induce?&quot;&quot;Well, no, I would wait until you were at least38 weeks, but you are almost 42,there is no reason to leave that baby inside,let&#39;s get you a room.&quot;I said, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t we just do it again?We can collect more data.I can try to be really still for 20 minutes.We can average the two and seewhat that means. (Laughter)And he goes,&quot;Ma&#39;am, I just don&#39;t want you to have a miscarriage.&quot;That makes three of us.And then he says,&quot;Your chances of having a miscarriage doublewhen you go past your due date. Let&#39;s get you a room.&quot;Wow. So now as a statistician, what&#39;s my response?Show me the data!Dude, you&#39;re talking chances,I do chances all day long, tell me all about chances.Let&#39;s talk chances. (Laughter)Let&#39;s talk chances.

zh-cn:所以我说，“好，我流产的概率是从30%提高到了60%吗？我流产的可能性是什么？他说，“没有那么高，不过概率确实会翻倍我们真的是为了胎儿好。”我没有放弃，换了一个角度提问。我说，“好吧，每1000个足月的准妈妈，大概有多少位妈妈会在预产期快到的时候流产？”他看了看我，又看了看我丈夫说，“大概1000个中有1个。”我问，“好，那么1000个准妈妈中，多少个会在预产期过了之后流产？”
en:So I say, &quot;Okay, great.Do I go from a 30-percent chance to a 60-percent chance?Where are we here with this miscarriage thing?And he goes, &quot;Not quite, but it doubles,and we really just want what&#39;s best for the baby.&quot;Undaunted, I try a different angle.I said, &quot;Okay, out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women,how many of them are going to miscarryjust before their due date?And then he looks at me and looks at Donald,and he goes, about one in 1,000.I said, &quot;Okay, so of those 1,000 women, how manyare going to miscarry just after their due date?&quot;
时间： 4:13
zh-cn:“大概2个。”（笑声）我说，“好的，所以你刚才跟我说的是我流产的概率从0.1%提高到了0.2%.”
en:&quot;About two.&quot; (Laughter)I said, &quot;Okay, so you are telling me that my chancesgo from a 0.1-percent chanceto a 0.2-percent chance.&quot;
时间： 4:27
zh-cn:好，到目前为止所有这些数据都没有说服我们让我们接受引产于是接下来我们又开始新一轮讨论有关引产手术会增加剖腹产的可能性，而这个是我们希望能够避免的然后我说“其实我真的不知道我的预产期是否是准确的。”（笑声）这句话真的惊到他了他看起来非常的困惑我接着说，“你可能不知道但是预产期的计算是基于28天的生理周期而我的月经周期不规律从27天到38天不等而且我有自己的周期记录来证明这一点（笑声）所以，那天最后的结果是，我们没有引产，回家了事实上我们必须签一个免责声明才能够从医院回家我不是在怂恿你不去听你的医生的话因为我们的第一个孩子也是在第38周的时候引产的因為子宮頸黏液偏低我并不是那种反对医疗介入的人但是为什么那天我会满怀自信的离开医院那是因为我有数据，支持我的观点我们已经收集了6年相关的数据我收集了体温数据这个数据透露出来不同的信息事实上，我们有可能非常精确的预测怀孕或许你会愿意在你孩子的婚礼上分享这个故事（笑声）我还记得那天，就像昨天才发生一样当我与你父亲深情对望的时候我的体温飙到了97.8华氏度 （笑声）是的。二十多年过去了我们一直在说这个故事那天我们之所以很自信的离开医院因为我们一直在收集数据这些数据看起来如何？这是一个女性在一次完整的生理周期过程中早晨体表温度的变化图从每次月经周期的开始到下一次月经周期的开始你会看到这个温度曲线是有规律的很明显的在生理周期的开始温度是比较低的然后你会看到温度突然上升直到她生理周期的结束为什么会这样？这些数据告诉你什么？女士们，在我们周期的开始你体内主要是雌性激素起主导作用这种激素会抑制你的体温排卵期开始之后，你的身体产生一个卵子这个时候孕酮开始起主导作用，准备怀孕所以你的身体开始升温为新的受精卵做好准备工作为什么温度突然升高？想想鸟类妈妈孵蛋为什么鸟妈妈要坐在蛋上呢？因为她希望保持蛋的温度保护它们并让它们保持温暖女士们，我们的身体每个月都在做同样的事情它提高我们的体温为接纳新生命做准备如果什么事情都没有发生，没有怀孕那么雌性激素的水平又会上来这个循环又重新开始而当你真的受孕了那么你会看到另一种体温变化曲线温度会一直保持在较高的水平直到分娩这就是为什么有些孕妇很容易出汗，觉得热因为她们的体温就是变高了这是我们三四年前记录的数据我们看到这个曲线的时候真的很兴奋你看到刚开始的时候体温是偏低的然后开始变高，持续4到5天这大概是一个卵细胞从输卵管移动到子宫开始着床的时间然后你看到温度的数值又开始往上提高了一点点事实上，当时我们看到了第二个温度的变化通过早早孕测试证实了我确实怀孕了那是我们的第一个孩子我们非常兴奋但是在几天之后我开始有点状出血接着我注意到出血量大量增加事实上我是怀孕初期流产如果我没有一直保持记录这些数据我非常有可能把这个事情理解为我那次的月经延后而已但是我们通过这些数据知道了我实际上经历了一次流产即使这些数据透露出来的故事对于我们而言是不幸的当我们去找医生的时候这些信息依然非常有价值所以当我们去咨询受孕有关的问题时我有数据可以提供（给大夫）:看，我之前怀孕了，我的体温变高了但是不知为何流产了我们怎么做可以避免此类事情发生？这种方法不仅仅适用于体温也不仅仅适用于怀孕过程我们可以根据我们身体的数据发现很多很多的事情
en:Okay, so at this point the data is not convincing usthat we need to be induced,and so then we proceed to have a conversationabout how inductions lead to a higher rateof Cesarean sections, and if at all possible we&#39;d like to avoid that.And then I said,&quot;And I really don&#39;t think my due date is accurate.&quot;(Laughter)And so this really stunned himand he looked sort of puzzledand I said, &quot;You may not know this,but pregnancy due dates are calculatedassuming that you have a standard 28-day cycle,and my cycle ranges —sometimes it&#39;s 27, sometimes it&#39;s up to 38 —and I have been collecting the data to prove it.(Laughter)And so we ended up leaving the hospital that day without being induced.We actually had to sign a waiver to walk out of the hospital.And I&#39;m not advocating that you not listen to your doctors,because even with our first child,we were induced at 38 weeks; cervical fluid was low.I&#39;m not anti-medical intervention.But why were confident to leave that day?Well, we had data that told a different story.We had been collecting data for six years.I had this temperature data,and it told a different story.In fact, we could probably pretty accurately estimate conception.Yeah, that&#39;s a story you want to tellat your kid&#39;s wedding reception. (Laughter)I remember like it was yesterday.My temperature was a sizzling 97.8 degreesas I stared into your father&#39;s eyes. (Laughter)Oh, yeah. Twenty-two more years, we&#39;re telling that story.But we were confident to leave because we had been collecting data.Now, what does that data look like?Here&#39;s a standard chartof a woman&#39;s waking body temperatureduring the course of a cycle.So from the beginning of the menstrual cycletill the beginning of the next.You&#39;ll see that the temperature is not random.Clearly there is a low patternat the beginning of her cycleand then you see this jump and then a higherset of temperatures at the end of her cycle.So what&#39;s happening here?What is that data telling you?Well, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle,the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogencauses a suppression of your body temperature.And at ovulation, your body releases an eggand progesterone takes over, pro-gestation.And so your body heats up in anticipationof housing this new little fertilized egg.So why this temperature jump?Well, think about when a bird sits on her eggs.Why is she sitting on them?She wants to keep them warm,protect them and keep them warm.Ladies, this is exactly what our bodies do every month,they heat up in anticipationof keeping a new little life warm.And if nothing happens, if you are not pregnant,then estrogen takes back over and that cycle starts all over again.But if you do get pregnant, sometimes youactually see another shift in your temperaturesand it stays elevated for those whole nine months.That&#39;s why you see those pregnant women just sweating and hot,because their temperatures are high.Here&#39;s a chart that we had about three or four years ago.We were really very excited about this chart.You&#39;ll see the low temperature leveland then a shift and for about five days,that&#39;s about the time it takes for the egg to traveldown the fallopian tube and implant,and then you see those temperatures start to go up a little bit.And in fact, we had a second temperature shift,confirmed with a pregnancy test that were indeed pregnantwith our first child, very exciting.Until a couple of days laterI saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow,and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage.Had I not been taking my temperatureI really would have just thought my period was late that month,but we actually had data to showthat we had miscarried this baby,and even though this data revealed a reallyunfortunate event in our lives,it was information that we could then take to our doctor.So if there was a fertility issue or some problem,I had data to show:Look, we got pregnant, our temperature shifted,we somehow lost this baby.What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem?And it&#39;s not just about temperaturesand it&#39;s not just about fertility;we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things.

zh-cn:举个例子，你是否知道通过你的温度能够推断你的甲状腺功能的状态？你的甲状腺在你身体中的作用，可以类比为一座房子的恒温器你希望你的房子的温度能够保持在一个理想的水平你可以调节你的恒温器如果你的房子温度太低了你的恒温器就会开始工作“嘿，我们需要加加热”如果你的房子太热了，恒温器就会发出命令“把空调打开，降低温度。”你的甲状腺在你身体的作用正是如此你的甲状腺尝试为你的身体维持一个理想温度你冷了，你的甲状腺会说“嘿，我们需要升温。”如果体温高了，它负责降温但是如果甲状腺功能出了问题会如何呢？当甲状腺出问题的时候你的体温就会表现出来体温会比正常体温低或是其它更奇怪的表现所以通过收集这些数据你可以知道你的甲状腺的一些信息
en:For instance, did you know that taking your temperature can tell you a lotabout the condition of your thyroid?So, your thyroid works a lot like the thermostat in your house.There is an optimal temperature that you want in your house;you set your thermostat.When it gets too cold in the house,your thermostat kicks inand says, &quot;Hey, we need to blow some heat around.&quot;Or if it gets too hot, your thermostatregisters, &quot;Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off.&quot;That&#39;s exactly how your thyroid works in your body.Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperaturefor your body.If it gets too cold, your thyroid says, &quot;Hey, we need to heat up.&quot;If it gets too hot, your thyroid cools you down.But what happens when your thyroid is not functioning well?When it doesn&#39;t function, then it shows upin your body temperatures,they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic.And so by collecting this datayou can find out information about your thyroid.

zh-cn:现在，如果你觉得甲状腺出问题了，你去找医生医生一般会给你抽血化验看下促甲状腺激素的水平这没问题。问题是这个化验没有办法告诉你和医生这个激素的实际效果有可能你化验出来的激素水平相当高但是这些激素并没有能够有效的调节你的体温所以只需要每天收集和记录自己的体温你就能够知道你的甲状腺的状态那么，如果你不想每天测量体温,那该怎么办呢？我建议你测量不过也有非常多的数据你可以去收集你可以量血压，可以称体重 —嗯，在座有没有人喜欢每天都称体重 （笑声）
en:Now, what is it, if you had a thyroid problem and you went to the doctor,your doctor would actually test the amount ofthyroid stimulating hormone in your blood.Fine. But the problem with that test isit doesn&#39;t tell you how active the hormone is in your body.So you might have a lot of hormone present,but it might not be actively working to regulateyour body temperature.So just by collecting your temperature every day,you get information about the condition of your thyroid.So, what if you don&#39;t want to take your temperature every day?I advocate that you do,but there are tons of other things you could take.You could take your blood pressure, you could take your weight —yeah, who&#39;s excited abouttaking their weight every day? (Laughter)

zh-cn:我跟我丈夫刚结婚的时候，他有鼻塞他当时吃很多药想要缓解他的鼻塞，不过效果不好有一天夜里他把我推醒，跟我说“老婆，我没法用鼻子呼吸。”我翻身过去，看了看他，问“那你能用嘴呼吸吗？”（笑声）他说，（喘气声）“可以，但是我不能用鼻子呼吸！”作为一个好妻子我带他冲到医院急救室当时是半夜两点我开车的时候一直在想丈夫你千万不能死在路上啊我们才结婚别人会觉得是我杀了你的 （笑声）最终我们到了急救中心护士看了看我丈夫还是不能用鼻子呼吸所以护士带我们去见了医生医生问，“什么问题？”我丈夫说，“我不能用鼻子呼吸。”医生问，“你不能用鼻子呼吸了？”是，但是他可以用嘴呼吸。（笑声）他退后观察了我们两个人然后说，“先生，我大概知道了你是心脏病发作我这就为你准备心电图检测和CT扫描。”我们的反应是不，不，不是心脏病。他能呼吸只是得用嘴而已。不，不，不，不然后我们就跟大夫反复讨论因为我们认为这个诊断不正确他的反应是，“没关系的，没事的，别激动。”我的反应是，“怎么能冷静下来？”但是我真的不认为是心脏病发作非常幸运的是，这个医生快下班了另一个医生进来了看到一个狂躁的我，和我那个不能用鼻子呼吸的丈夫。（笑声）新医生开始问我们问题他问，“嗯，你俩来之前做了什么运动么？”我们经常骑脚踏车，偶尔去健身房（笑声）我们会走动走动他问，“你们来之前，在做什么？”我在想，我在睡觉，真的但是，我丈夫之前在干嘛？我丈夫开始报出自己正在吃的各种药的名字他说，“我吃了这个鼻子减充血剂然后喷了这个喷鼻剂，”然后突然之间新医生发现了答案“哦！你不能这么干，这两个不能同时用百分百鼻塞。来，给你开另外一种药。”他给我们开了个处方我跟丈夫面面相觑，然后我看着医生说，“为什么看起来你能够准确的诊断出来问题但是之前那个医生却想要做心电图和CT扫描？”他看了我们一眼说“是的，当一个350磅的胖子跑到急救室说自己不能呼吸你得假设他有心脏病发作来不及先问诊了。”急诊科大夫所受的训练是快速诊断但他们的诊断不都是正确的所以如果我们有一些自己心脏的数据和医生分享或许第一个医生就能够给我们更好的诊断
en:Early on in our marriage, Donald had a stuffy noseand he had been taking a slew of medicationsto try to relieve his stuffy nose, to no avail.And so, that night he comes and he wakes me up and he says,&quot;Honey, I can&#39;t breath out of my nose.&quot;And I roll over and I look, and I said, &quot;Well, can you breath out of your mouth?&quot;(Laughter)And he goes, &quot;Yes, but I can&#39;t breath out of my nose!&quot;And so like any good wife, I rush himto the emergency roomat 2 o&#39;clock in the morning.And the whole time I&#39;m driving and I&#39;m thinking,you can&#39;t die on me now.We just got married,people will think I killed you! (Laughter)And so, we get to the emergency room, and the nurse sees us,and he can&#39;t breath out of his nose, and soshe brings us to the back and the doctor says,&quot;What seems to be the problem?&quot; and he goes, &quot;I can&#39;t breath out of my nose.&quot;And he said, &quot;You can&#39;t breath out of your nose?No, but he can breath out of his mouth. (Laughter)He takes a step back and he looks at both of usand he says &quot;Sir, I think I know the problem.You&#39;re having a heart attack.I&#39;m going to order an EKG and a CAT scanfor you immediately.&quot;And we are thinking,no, no, no. It&#39;s not a heart attack. He can breathe,just out of his mouth. No, no, no, no, no.And so we go back and forth with this doctorbecause we think this is the incorrect diagnosis,and he&#39;s like, &quot;No really, it&#39;ll be fine, just calm down.&quot;And I&#39;m thinking, how do you calm down? But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s having a heart attack.And so fortunately for us, this doctor was at the end of the shift.So this new doctor comes in, he sees us clearlydistraught, with a husband who can&#39;t breathout of his nose. (Laughter)And he starts asking us questions.He says, &quot;Well, do you two exercise?&quot;We ride our bikes, we go to the gym occasionally.(Laughter)We move around.And he says, &quot;What were you doing just before you came here?&quot;I&#39;m thinking, I was sleeping, honestly.But okay, what was Donald doing just before?So Donald goes into this slew of medications he was taking.He lists, &quot;I took this decongestant and then I took this nasal spray,&quot;and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says,&quot;Oh! You should never mix this decongestant with this nasal spray.Clogs you up every time. Here, take this one instead.&quot;He gives us a prescription.We&#39;re looking at each other, and I looked at the doctor,and I said, &quot;Why is it that it seems like youwere able to accurately diagnose his condition,but this previous doctor wanted to orderan EKG and a CAT scan?&quot;And he looks at us and says,&quot;Well, when a 350-pound man walks in the emergency room and says he can&#39;t breath,you assume he&#39;s having a heart attackand you ask questions later.&quot;Now, emergency room doctors are trained to make decisions quickly,but not always accurately.And so had we had some informationabout our heart health to share with him,maybe we would have gotten a better diagnosis the first time.

zh-cn:我希望给各位展示一下这张图图上测量的是血压时间范围从2010年10月到2012年7月你会发现测量的值一开始落在了高血压和高血压前期的区间,但是在一年半之后血压回落到了正常的范围现在这个心率看起来像是一个16岁的小伙子的这个故事告诉你们什么？很显然这表现的是一个人发生了天翻地覆的变化非常幸运的，这个人今天也来到了现场当年走进急救室的那个人我那350磅的丈夫现在变得更加性感和健康现在只有225磅前面的血压图就是他的记录在一年半之间我丈夫的饮食和我们的运动习惯都做了改变因为这些改变他的心率有了改善他的血压也有了很大的改善
en:I want you to consider the following chart,of systolic blood pressure measurementsfrom October 2010 to July 2012.You&#39;ll see that these measurements startin the prehypertension/hypertension zone,but over about the course of a year and a halfthey move into the normal zone.This is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old.What story is this data telling you?Obviously it&#39;s the data from someonewho&#39;s made a drastic transformation,and fortunately for us, that person happens to be here today.So that 350-pound guy that walked into the emergency room with meis now an even sexier and healthier225-pound guy, and that&#39;s his blood pressure trace.So over the course of that year and a halfDonald&#39;s eating changedand our exercise regimen changed,and his heart rate responded,his blood pressure responded to that changethat he made in his body.
