zh-cn:我想以塞思.戈丁的方式开始演讲，那就是讲个故事。当我还是12岁的时候我叔叔 Ed 给了一件非常漂亮的蓝色羊毛衫至少我认为很漂亮一群绒毛斑马横穿肚子部分，乞力马扎罗山和梅鲁山差不多横跨胸前部分，当然也是绒毛的。我一有机会就穿上它，总是觉得那是我拥有过的最好的东西
en:I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin,from when I was 12 years old.My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater —at least I thought it was beautiful.And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach,and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind ofright across the chest, that were also fuzzy.And I wore it whenever I could,thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.

zh-cn:直到有一天9年级的时候当我和一群橄榄球队员站在一起的时候我的体形已经明显变化了， Matt Mussolian他是我在中学时候毫无疑问的克星放高声说道我们再不用去很远的地方去滑雪了，但是我们可以去诺沃格拉茨山去滑雪了。（笑声）我当时觉得很屈辱和羞愧我立即跑回家，到母亲面前来埋怨埋怨她让我一直穿着这件丑陋恶心的羊毛衫我们开车到Goodwill(旧货廉价店)把那件羊毛衫扔掉了多少很隆重的样子我的想法就是，再也不用想这件羊毛衫了再也不用看到它了。
en:Until one day in ninth grade,when I was standing with a number of the football players.And my body had clearly changed, and Matt,who was undeniably my nemesis in high school,said in a booming voice thatwe no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips,but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.(Laughter)And I was so humiliated and mortifiedthat I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised herfor ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater awaysomewhat ceremoniously,my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweaternor see it ever again.

zh-cn:时间飞逝，11年过去了，我已经是25岁的大小孩了。我在基加利，卢旺达，在陡坡上慢跑，结果我看到，大约10英尺前面，一个小男孩 - 11岁左右向我的方向跑来，穿着我的羊毛衫。我当时想，不，这不可能但是 处于好奇，我向着这个小男孩跑过去当然了，把他的魂都吓出来了抓住他的衣领，把它翻过来，我的名字就在上面就写在羊毛衫衣领上面
en:Fast forward — 11 years later, I&#39;m a 25-year-old kid.I&#39;m working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes,when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy — 11 years old —running toward me, wearing my sweater.And I&#39;m thinking, no, this is not possible.But so, curious, I run up to the child — of coursescaring the living bejesus out of him —grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my namewritten on the collar of this sweater.

zh-cn:我说这个故事，是因为它一直都是一个很好的隐喻，来暗示这个世界的层层相关作用我们都生活在地球上，层层相关。我们经常太不注意我们的各种做为和不做为对我们永远都不会见到和知道的人产生什么影响我说这个故事，还因为它告诉我们一个更大的背景故事一个讲述援助是什么以及它能做的故事。也就是这件羊毛衫千里迢迢旅行到了那里，从佛吉尼亚的Goodwill廉价店里并且到了这个更大的行业中这个给非洲和亚洲百万吨的二手衣服的行业这也是非常好的事情，提供了成本低廉的衣物同时，在卢旺达这行业也摧毁了当地的零售业不是说它本不应该而是说我们怎样更好的回答这些问题而是我们应该怎样考虑事情的后果以及反响。
en:I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serveas a metaphor to me about the level of connectednessthat we all have on this Earth.We so often don&#39;t realize what our action and our inactiondoes to people we think we will never see and never know.I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual storyof what aid is and can be.That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia,and moved its way into the larger industry,which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia.Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing.And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda,it destroyed the local retailing industry.Not to say that it shouldn&#39;t have,but that we have to get better at answering the questionsthat need to be considered when we think about consequencesand responses.

zh-cn:所以我就继续讲讲卢旺达，大概1985、86的时候，当时我在哪里做两件事。我和20个未婚妈妈开了个面包店我们被称为：坏消息狗熊，并且我们的主张是我们要在基加利垄断零食生意那也不是一件难事，因为之前压根就没有过零食这一说。因为商业模式还不错，我们成功了我看着这些妇女在微观层面上的转变同时我也开始了微观融资银行明天，Iqbal Quadir 先生将要讨论到格兰米先生他是微观融资银行鼻祖现在已经是一种世界性的活动 - 算得上是一种爆红了 -但是那时候这个理念还是很新奇的，尤其是在哪些刚刚从交换体制转到贸易体制的经济体。
en:So, I&#39;m going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986,where I was doing two things.I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers.We were called the &quot;Bad News Bears,&quot; and our notion waswe were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali,which was not hard because there were no snacks before us.And because we had a good business model, we actually did it,and I watched these women transform on a micro-level.But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank,and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen,which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks,which now is a worldwide movement — you talk about a meme —but then it was quite new, especially in an economythat was moving from barter into trade.

zh-cn:我们作对了很多的事情我们关注商业模式，我们坚持参与到投资中来，妇女们做最后的决定，比方说她们如何用生意去敲开信贷的门开始慢慢积累小生意，挣更多的收入这样更好地照顾自己的家庭
en:We got a lot of things right.We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game.The women made their own decisions at the end of the dayas to how they would use this access to creditto build their little businesses, earn more incomeso they could take care of their families better.

zh-cn:我们没有理解的是正在发生在我们周围的事情恐惧种族和冲突交杂在一起当时那种所谓的援助游戏参与到这项在卢旺达看不到却感受得到的运动在那时，30%的预算来自于国外援助1994年发生了种族灭绝就在这些妇女为了编制梦想一起工作了七年之后。可喜的是这个制度银行机制留存了下来实际上，它也成为卢旺达的最大的复兴银行面包行被彻底的摧毁了对于我来说，经验教训就是：负责心最重要。干事业要以人为本，就如Steven Levitt所说，商业模式中应有激励制度才行。要知道，不管事情多么复杂，激励机制总会有效的
en:What we didn&#39;t understand, what was happening all around us,with the confluence of fear, ethnic strifeand certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing intothis invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda,that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.The genocide happened in 1994,seven years after these women all worked togetherto build this dream.And the good news was that the institution,the banking institution, lasted.In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.The bakery was completely wiped out,but the lessons for me were that accountability counts —got to build things with people on the ground,using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say,the incentives matter.Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.

zh-cn:当Chris向我提起每件事有多有效每件正在发生的事，多么美好我们看到时代精神的转变一方面，我完全赞同他的观点我也非常兴奋的看到八国会议讨论的事情这个世界因为有像首相布莱尔和博诺(爱尔兰歌手)还有鲍伯盖朵夫(爱尔兰歌手) - 世界才会谈论全球贫穷世界才会谈论非洲用这种我一生中前所未有的方式谈论真是令人激奋另一方面，让我夜夜难以入眠的是对看待八国会议成功所产生的一种恐惧对非洲的援助增加了500亿元400亿元减少的外债-作为一种胜利作为前进的第一步，作为我们自己的道德赦罪
en:So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everythingthat was happening in the world,that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist,on the one hand I absolutely agree with him,and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 —that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bonoand Bob Geldof — the world is talking about global poverty;the world is talking about Africain ways I have never seen in my life.It&#39;s thrilling.And at the same time, what keeps me up at nightis a fear that we&#39;ll look at the victories of the G8 —50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa,40 billion in reduced debt — as the victory,as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.

zh-cn:实际，我们需要做的是，迈出第一步后，庆祝一下，结束它，认识到我们还需要迈出第二步，这就是付出实际行动，一切在于如何去做如果你只记得我今天演讲的一个内容的话，我希望你记住唯一结束贫穷，让它成为历史的方法是从根本上建立一个真正可行的机制这种机制能够给贫穷的人供应关键的，能买得起的物品和服务以一种经济上可持续的和可发展的方式我们如果那么做，我们真的可以让贫穷成为历史
en:And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one,celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter twothat is all about execution, all about the how-to.And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today,it&#39;s that the only way to end poverty, to make it history,is to build viable systems on the groundthat deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor,in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.If we do that, we really can make poverty history.

zh-cn:就是这样，就是这么一个整体的哲学理念它激励着我开始了当前的奋斗叫做敏锐基金它会帮助你建立一些微观蓝图它可以帮助我们在用水，医疗和住房行业在巴基斯坦，印度，肯尼亚，坦桑尼亚和埃及我也想稍微谈一下它，举几个例子这样你就知道我们正在做的到底是什么。不过在那之前，我要说说另外一个我经常抱怨的事情，我想说说这些穷人到底是谁。因为我们常常把他们当做是一个巨大的渴求被释放的群体，但实际上，他们的故事却是要不平凡得许多。宏观上说，地球上40亿人口每天挣不到4美元
en:And it was that — that whole philosophy —that encouraged me to start my current endeavorcalled &quot;Acumen Fund,&quot;which is trying to build some mini-blueprintsfor how we might do that in water, health and housingin Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples,so you can see what it is that we&#39;re doing.But before I do this — and this is another one of my pet peeves —I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.Because we too often talk about them as thesestrong, huge masses of people yearning to be free,when in fact, it&#39;s quite an amazing story.On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.
时间： 6:29
zh-cn:他们是我们讨论中所谓的穷人。如果你加起来算算，那是地球上第三大经济实体但是他们的绝大多数都成了对于我们来说看不见的人我们通常工作的地方，有这么一群人，他们每天只赚一到三美元。他们是谁呢？他们是农民和工厂工人他们为政府工作，他们是司机他们是家政服务者。他们通常为生活必需品和基本服务而挣钱，比如水比如医疗，住房，他们为了这些基本必需品要比中产阶级要多付30-40倍...至少是在卡拉奇和内罗毕这样的地方这些穷人愿意做聪明的决定，也做出过聪明的决定如果你给他们机会的话
en:That&#39;s who we talk about when we think about &quot;the poor.&quot;If you aggregate it, it&#39;s the third largest economy on Earth,and yet most of these people go invisible.Where we typically work, there&#39;s people making betweenone and three dollars a day.Who are these people?They are farmers and factory workers.They work in government offices. They&#39;re drivers.They are domestics.They typically pay for critical goods and services like water,like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 timeswhat their middleclass counterparts pay —certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions,if you give them that opportunity.

zh-cn:所以，两个例子一个印度，有着2.4亿农民的地方他们绝大多数每天挣不到2美元我们工作的地方奥兰加巴德，土地是非常干枯的。要知道，这些人平均挣60美分到1美元。这个穿红衣服的是个社会创业者，名叫Ami Tabar.他所做的就是看以色列的做过的事情，用更大的一个方法然后想想如何点滴灌溉这种方式把水直接带到农作物的根茎但是在以前，只有大的农场使用这项技术，所以Ami Tabar 把它改作成模块化,小到1/8英亩一些原则造小的让它可以无限拓展，并且让穷人也可以承担得起。
en:So, two examples.One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers,most of whom make less than two dollars a day.Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches,and figure out how to do a drip irrigation,which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.But previously it&#39;s only been created for large-scale farms,so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.A couple of principles:build small.Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.

zh-cn:有一个家庭，Sarita 和她的丈夫，买了一个15美元的单元当他们住在一起，其实就是三个墙板互相依靠在一起用一个皱巴巴的铁板作顶棚秋收过后，他们有了足够的收入可以买另外一个系统，以支持1/4英亩地几年后，我碰到他们他们每天可以挣四美元，差不多是印度的中产阶级了他们向我展示以前他们所打下的水泥地基用来建造他们的房子我发誓，你可以从妇女的眼中看到未来也就是我真正坚信的
en:This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unitwhen they were living in a — literally a three-walled lean-towith a corrugated iron roof.After one harvest, they had increased their income enoughto buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.A couple of years later, I meet them.They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India,and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laidto build their house.And I swear, you could see the future in that woman&#39;s eyes.Something I truly believe.

zh-cn:当今，你不可能谈论贫穷而不说疟疾蚊帐对此，我要再次将荣誉献给哈佛的Jeffrey Sachs，是他带给世界他的大胆意念 - 只需5美元，你就可以拯救一条生命疟疾是一种疾病，它可以一年杀死1-3百万人3 - 5亿病例被报道估计在非洲疾病对经济的损失达到130亿美金5美元可以拯救一条生命我们能够把人送上月球，我们能看火星是否有生命为何我们就不能够给5亿人口发放5美元的蚊帐呢
en:You can&#39;t talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets,and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvardhuge kudos for bringing to the worldthis notion of his rage — for five dollars you can save a life.Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.300 to 500 million cases are reported.It&#39;s estimated that Africa losesabout 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.Five dollars can save a life.We can send people to the moon; we can see if there&#39;s life on Mars —why can&#39;t we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?
时间： 8:59
zh-cn:但问题的关键，不是为什么我们不能而是我们如何让非洲人自己动手自给自足？有很多的障碍一：生产太少，二：价格太高三：这里看到的已经算是一条很好的道路，就在我们工厂旁边。想要分发是一个噩梦，但不是不可能我们刚开始的时候，把一个35万的贷款放给了一个传统生产蚊帐的非洲厂商这样他们能够从日本传授技术过去生产持久的，可以使用五年的蚊帐。这有一些工厂的照片，
en:The question, though, is not &quot;Why can&#39;t we?&quot;The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?A lot of hurdles.One: production is too low. Two: price is too high.Three: this is a good road in — right near where our factory is located.Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.We started by making a 350,000-dollar loanto the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africaso that they could transfer technology from Japanand build these long-lasting, five-year nets.Here are just some pictures of the factory.
时间： 9:34
zh-cn:今天，三年后，这个工厂又额外雇佣了上千个女工。这个厂发放60万块作为工资，给坦桑尼亚的经济做出了贡献它也是坦桑尼亚最大的工厂工厂的年产量是一百五十万个蚊帐年后他们会提高到3百万个蚊帐我们希望明年底产量能达到7百万这样一来，工厂这一方就起作用了。分发这一方面整个世界都有很多的工作要做现在，95%的蚊帐都是由联合国买下来然后送给非洲各地的人我们希望建立起来的是非洲最珍贵的资源-人力资源他们的妇女
en:Today, three years later, the company has employedanother thousand women.It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.It&#39;s the largest company in Tanzania.The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets,three million by the end of the year.We hope to have seven million at the end of next year.So the production side is working.On the distribution side, though,as a world, we have a lot of work to do.Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.,and then given primarily to people around Africa.We&#39;re looking at buildingon some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.Their women.

zh-cn:我想让你们认识一下Jacqueline和我同名，21岁了如果她出生世界上任何一个地方，只要不是坦桑尼亚我可以说，她绝对可以在华尔街运作自如她已经运作着两条线，她已经有足够的钱作为房子的首期款她已经挣了2美元一天，而且建立教育基金她告诉我她不会先结婚，也不会有孩子如果她不把这些事情给做完当我告诉她我们的想法──或许我们学习美国的特百惠模式想一种方式让妇女自己走出去把这些蚊帐给卖出去──她很快的算了算自己能够挣多少然后就签上了自己的名字
en:And so I want you to meet Jacqueline,my namesake, 21 years old.If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania,I&#39;m telling you, she could run Wall Street.She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough moneyto put a down payment on her house.She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund,and told me she is not marrying nor having childrenuntil these things are completed.And so, when I told her about our idea —that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States,and find a way for the women themselves to go outand sell these nets to others —she quickly started calculating what she herself could makeand signed up.
时间：10:54
zh-cn:我们从IDEO，我们最喜欢的公司之一，吸取到了经验快速地对这个做了一个原始经济模型把Jacqueline领到了她居住的地方她带上她平时有交情的10个妇女一起看她能否把这些蚊帐卖出去，5美元一件尽管人们都说没有人会买这么贵的蚊帐，但我们学到了如何卖东西的技巧不要一上来就推销自己的想法。因为她把疟疾放到了最后来讲。首先她谈到舒适，地位，美观这些蚊帐，她说，你把他们放在地板上，虫子会离开你的家小孩可以安稳地睡觉把她们挂在窗前，房子会看的很漂亮接着我们又开始做窗帘不仅是它漂亮美观，而且人们看到身份的象征一种你会照顾自己小孩的象征然后她说到可以挽救小孩的性命关于如何销售，许多的经验教训要学习的向穷人卖商品和服务
en:We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies,and quickly did a prototyping on this,and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.She brought 10 of the women with whom she interactstogether to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece,despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one,and we learned a lot about how you sell things.Not coming in with our own notions,because she didn&#39;t even talk about malaria until the very end.First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.Children can sleep through the night;the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.And we&#39;ve started making curtains,and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status —that you care about your children.Only then did she talk about saving your children&#39;s lives.A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sellgoods and services to the poor.
时间：11:49
zh-cn:我最后想说的是，我们有无限的机会让贫穷成为历史为了把它做好，我们必须建造有用的商业模式让它们能够衍生，让这些模式能够在非洲人，印度人中运作在所有发展中国家运作那些可以归为这一类的人，让他们自己去做因为到了最后，最关键的一切就是参与要知道人们要的不是施舍他们要自己做决定他们想自己解决问题通过他们的参与我们不仅为他们创造的尊严为我们自己也是我鼓励大家思考，下一次如何参与这个我们共同拥有的理念和机会让贫穷成为历史通过让自己成为这个过程的一部分让“我们”“他们”的观点远离我们意识到这些都是我们自己的一部分这个世界，我们，一起，生活和分享谢谢掌声
en:I want to end just by saying that there&#39;s enormous opportunityto make poverty history.To do it right, we have to build business models that matter,that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians,people all over the developing worldwho fit in this category, to do it themselves.Because at the end of the day, it&#39;s about engagement.It&#39;s about understanding that people really don&#39;t want handouts,that they want to make their own decisions;they want to solve their own problems;and that by engaging with them,not only do we create much more dignity for them,but for us as well.And so I urge all of you to think next timeas to how to engage with this notion and this opportunitythat we all have — to make poverty history —by really becoming part of the processand moving away from an us-and-them world,and realizing that it&#39;s about all of us,and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.Thank you.(Applause)
