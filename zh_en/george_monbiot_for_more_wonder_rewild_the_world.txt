zh-cn:我年轻的时候，有六年时间待在热带过着野外冒险生活我担任调查记者在世界上那些特别迷人的地方工作我有着只有在年轻男子身上你才会看到的年少无知，年轻气盛这也就是战争为什么会打响的原因但我也感受到从未有过的活力而当我回到家的时候我发现自我存在感正在慢慢减少直到某天我发现往洗碗机里装餐盘竟是一个有趣的挑战然后我感到自己像被困在生活的围墙内试图找到出路逃向墙外宽阔的天地从生态学角度看我坚信我曾经很无趣
en:When I was a young man, I spent six yearsof wild adventure in the tropicsworking as an investigative journalistin some of the most bewitching parts of the world.I was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be.This is why wars get fought.But I also felt more alive than I&#39;ve ever done since.And when I came home, I found the scope of my existencegradually diminishinguntil loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge.And I found myself sort ofscratching at the walls of life,as if I was trying to find a way outinto a wider space beyond.I was, I believe, ecologically bored.

zh-cn:如今，身处充满竞争的年代和在充斥着尖角，獠牙利齿，坚爪的原始社会相比我们仍拥有恐惧和勇气以及掌控这个时代所需要的野心但在安稳且拥挤的土地上在不伤害他人的前提下我们几乎没什么机会去发挥这些品性这就是我发现自己遇到的一个瓶颈为了征服这种不确定性对接下来的事物有所预知这几乎是工业社会一直以来的主导目标就在达成目标，或快接近的时候我们又遭遇了一系列新的需求我们看重安全甚于经验从中我们获益匪浅但我认为我们也有所损失
en:Now, we evolved in rather more challenging times than these,in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws.And we still possess the fear and the courageand the aggression required to navigate those times.But in our comfortable, safe, crowded lands,we have few opportunities to exercise themwithout harming other people.And this was the sort of constraint that I found myselfbumping up against.To conquer uncertainty,to know what comes next,that&#39;s almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies,and having got there, or almost got there,we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs.We&#39;ve privileged safety over experienceand we&#39;ve gained a lot in doing so,but I think we&#39;ve lost something too.

zh-cn:在过去的半个世纪最让人振奋的科学发现之一就是广泛存在于自然界的营养级联营养级联是一个生态过程从食物链的顶层开始自上而下到达底层最经典的例子是美国黄石国家公园1995 年重新放归狼群我们都知道，狼会猎杀很多不同种类的动物但或许我们有些不太清楚它们也给许多其他的物种带来了生机这听起来很奇怪，但请听我说在狼放归之前它们缺席已有 70 年了因为没有天敌追逐它们黄石公园里鹿的数量不断增加尽管人类作出努力想去控制它们但它们已经将很多植被食用殆尽可是，一旦狼群出现即便数量不多却产生了显著的效果当然，它们猎杀了一些鹿但那不是最重要的更重要的是它们从根本上改变了鹿群的行为方式鹿群开始回避黄石公园里的某些部分那些它们最容易被困住的地方特别是山谷和峡谷植物在那里再度生长起来在一些地区，树木的高度在短短六年里增加了五倍光秃秃的山谷没多久就有了大片树木长满了山杨树，柳树和杨木树木的种类数量多了起来鸟儿就开始加入鸣禽和候鸟类的数量开始快速增加海狸的数量开始增加因为树木为它们提供食物海狸，和狼一样，都是生态系统工程师它们为其他物种创造生态龛位在河里住建水坝水坝是水獭，麝鼠鸭子，鱼类， 爬行动物和两栖动物的栖息地狼捕杀郊狼因此兔子和老鼠的数量开始上升这意味着出现了更多的鹰，黄鼠狼更多的狐狸、 獾乌鸦和秃鹰食用狼群离开后留下的腐尸熊的数量也增加了部分因为有了更多的浆果出现在新生的灌木上熊进一步加强了狼群的作用它们也猎杀一些幼鹿
en:One of the most exciting scientific findingsof the past half centuryhas been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades.A trophic cascade is an ecological processwhich starts at the top of the food chainand tumbles all the way down to the bottom,and the classic example is what happenedin the Yellowstone National Park in the United Stateswhen wolves were reintroduced in 1995.Now, we all know that wolves kill various species of animals,but perhaps we&#39;re slightly less awarethat they give life to many others.It sounds strange, but just follow me for a while.Before the wolves turned up,they&#39;d been absent for 70 years.The numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them,had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park,and despite efforts by humans to control them,they&#39;d managed to reduce much of the vegetation thereto almost nothing, they&#39;d just grazed it away.But as soon as the wolves arrived,even though they were few in number,they started to have the most remarkable effects.First, of course, they killed some of the deer,but that wasn&#39;t the major thing.Much more significantly,they radically changed the behavior of the deer.The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park,the places where they could be trapped most easily,particularly the valleys and the gorges,and immediately those places started to regenerate.In some areas, the height of the treesquintupled in just six years.Bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspenand willow and cottonwood.And as soon as that happened,the birds started moving in.The number of songbirds, of migratory birds,started to increase greatly.The number of beavers started to increase,because beavers like to eat the trees.And beavers, like wolves, are ecosystem engineers.They create niches for other species.And the dams they built in the riversprovided habitats for otters and muskratsand ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians.The wolves killed coyotes, and as a result of that,the number of rabbits and mice began to rise,which meant more hawks, more weasels,more foxes, more badgers.Ravens and bald eagles came down to feedon the carrion that the wolves had left.Bears fed on it too, and their population began to rise as well,partly also because there were more berriesgrowing on the regenerating shrubs,and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolvesby killing some of the calves of the deer.

zh-cn:但是更有趣的地方在于狼群改变了河流的行为习惯河流的迂回减少了侵蚀减弱，河道收窄形成了更多的池塘和浅滩这些都是非常适合野生动物的栖息地河流因为狼群的再出现而改变因为新生长出的大片树林使河岸稳固，于是滑坡减少因此河道就更为稳固另外，由于鹿群被赶出了某些区块河谷坡上的植被得以恢复水土流失也少了因为植被使得土壤更稳固总之，尽管狼的数量不多不但改变了黄石国家公园这面积巨大的土地上的生态系统还改变了其自然地貌
en:But here&#39;s where it gets really interesting.The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers.They began to meander less.There was less erosion. The channels narrowed.More pools formed, more riffle sections,all of which were great for wildlife habitats.The rivers changedin response to the wolves,and the reason was that the regenerating forestsstabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often,so that the rivers became more fixed in their course.Similarly, by driving the deer out of some placesand the vegetation recovering on the valley sides,there was less soil erosion,because the vegetation stabilized that as well.So the wolves, small in number,transformed not just the ecosystemof the Yellowstone National Park, this huge area of land,but also its physical geography.

zh-cn:南部海域的鲸鱼也有着同样广泛的影响其中一个日本政府用来正当化捕鲸行为的后理性借口是他们说，&quot;鲸鱼被捕杀后该海域鱼和磷虾的数量将上升为人类提供更多的食物。”这是一个愚蠢的借口但它听起来似乎还是有点儿道理的因为你会想当然地认为，鲸鱼吃掉大量的鱼和磷虾，很明显，把鲸鱼去除鱼和磷虾数量会增加但情况正好相反把鲸鱼去除后磷虾的数量剧减为什么会这样呢?人们发现，原来鲸鱼对于维持这一整个生态系统至关重要其中一个原因是鲸鱼在较深的水下进食然后到水面上排泄生物学家礼貌地称之为大型粪便羽大量的粪便在水面在海洋透光层，那里有足够的光照量可以进行光合作用那些大量的羽毛状的肥料刺激了浮游植物的增殖处于食物链的底端的浮游植物刺激了浮游动物的增殖作为食物供给了鱼类磷虾等其他生物鲸鱼的另一个重要任务是它们在水中上下穿梭游动它们把浮游植物重新搅动回水面让它们继续存活和繁殖有趣的是，我们知道在海洋中的浮游植物能吸收大气中的碳浮游植物越多它们吸收的碳也就越多它们最终深入海底带走了大气系统中的碳在鲸鱼数量繁盛的历史时期它们估计每年从大气中带走数千万吨的碳
en:Whales in the southern oceanshave similarly wide-ranging effects.One of the many post-rational excusesmade by the Japanese government for killing whalesis that they said, &quot;Well, the number of fish and krill will riseand then there&#39;ll be more for people to eat.&quot;Well, it&#39;s a stupid excuse, but it sort ofkind of makes sense, doesn&#39;t it,because you&#39;d think that whales eat huge amountsof fish and krill, so obviously take the whales away,there&#39;ll be more fish and krill.But the opposite happened.You take the whales away,and the number of krill collapses.Why would that possibly have happened?Well, it now turns out that the whales are crucialto sustaining that entire ecosystem,and one of the reasons for thisis that they often feed at depthand then they come up to the surface and producewhat biologists politely call large fecal plumes,huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters,up in the photic zone, where there&#39;s enough lightto allow photosynthesis to take place,and those great plumes of fertilizerstimulate the growth of phytoplankton,the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain,which stimulate the growth of zooplankton,which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it.The other thing that whales do is that,as they&#39;re plunging up and down through the water column,they&#39;re kicking the phytoplanktonback up towards the surfacewhere it can continue to survive and reproduce.And interestingly, well, we knowthat plant plankton in the oceansabsorb carbon from the atmosphere —the more plant plankton there are,the more carbon they absorb —and eventually they filter down into the abyssand remove that carbon from the atmospheric system.Well, it seems that when whales were at their historic populations,they were probably responsible for sequesteringsome tens of millions of tons of carbonevery year from the atmosphere.

zh-cn:综合这些例子，你想想看等一下，狼群能够改变黄石国家公园的自然地理鲸鱼能够改变大气的构成你开始看到这样一种可能性就像詹姆斯 · 洛夫洛克的盖亚假说设想世界是一个整体的是能够自我调节的有机体在生态系统这个层面累积了一个能够证明盖亚假说的证据
en:And when you look at it like that, you think,wait a minute, here are the wolveschanging the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park.Here are the whales changingthe composition of the atmosphere.You begin to see that possibly,the evidence supporting James Lovelock&#39;s Gaia hypothesis,which conceives of the world as a coherent,self-regulating organism,is beginning, at the ecosystem level, to accumulate.

zh-cn:营养级联告诉我们，自然界比我们想得更为神奇和复杂它告诉我们，当你移除了大型动物你剩下的将是一个完全不同的生态系统这个系统和保留大型动物的系统是不同的在我看来，这些都是强有力的案例用以支持再引入缺失物种野化，于我意味着带回那些已消失的植物和动物意味着卸除藩篱意味着塞住排水渠意味着制止某些大面积海域的商业捕鱼行为除此以外，人类只需后退一步野化对什么是一个正确的生态系统或物种组合的正确与否不做评论野化不是试图建造荒地或牧场或雨林或海藻园或珊瑚礁它让大自然做出决定一般情况下，大自然很擅长做决定
en:Trophic cascadestell us that the natural worldis even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was.They tell us that when you take away the large animals,you are left with a radically different ecosystemto one which retains its large animals.And they make, in my view, a powerful casefor the reintroduction of missing species.Rewilding, to me,means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals.It means taking down the fences,it means blocking the drainage ditches,it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea,but otherwise stepping back.It has no view as to what a right ecosystemor a right assemblage of species looks like.It doesn&#39;t try to produce a heath or a meadowor a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef.It lets nature decide,and nature, by and large, is pretty good at deciding.

zh-cn:我提到野化的两个定义让我对此感兴趣我要说的另一个定义是人类生活方式的野化我并不认为这是文明的替代品我相信我们可以享受高新科技带来的好处就像现在这样，但同时，如果我们选择去获得更丰富和野性的冒险生活只要我们想，就能去那些精彩的野化生态栖息地
en:Now, I mentioned that there are two definitionsof rewilding that interest me.The other oneis the rewilding of human life.And I don&#39;t see this as an alternativeto civilization.I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology,as we&#39;re doing now, but at the same time, if we choose,have access to a richer and wilder life of adventurewhen we want to becausethere would be wonderful, rewilded habitats.

zh-cn:这样的机会比你想象的增长速度要快得多有一项研究估计，在美国原本森林被砍伐的土地中，有三分之二已经重新造林，伐木工人和农民离开了这样的现象尤其在美国东部较为常见另一种研究表示欧洲有三千万公顷的土地其面积大小相当于波兰的领土面积农民将会在2000 至 2030 年间撤离
en:And the opportunities for thisare developing more rapidly than you might think possible.There&#39;s one estimate which suggests that in the United States,two thirds of the land which was once forested and then clearedhas become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated,particularly from the eastern half of the country.There&#39;s another one which suggeststhat 30 million hectares of land in Europe,an area the size of Poland,will be vacated by farmersbetween 2000 and 2030.

en:Now, faced with opportunities like that,does it not seem a little unambitiousto be thinking only of bringing back wolves, lynx,bears, beavers, bison, boar, moose,and all the other species which are already beginningto move quite rapidly across Europe?Perhaps we should also start thinkingabout the return of some of our lost megafauna.

en:What megafauna, you say?Well, every continent had one,apart from Antarctica.When Trafalgar Square in London was excavated,the river gravels there were foundto be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus,rhinos, elephants, hyenas, lions.Yes, ladies and gentlemen,there were lions in Trafalgar Squarelong before Nelson&#39;s Column was built.All these species lived herein the last interglacial period,when temperatures were pretty similar to our own.It&#39;s not climate, largely,which has got rid of the world&#39;s megafaunas.It&#39;s pressure from the human populationhunting and destroying their habitatswhich has done so.

zh-cn:即便如此，你仍然可以在现代生态系统中看到这些巨型物种的影子为什么有那么多的落叶树木能够从树干断裂的任何地方发出嫩芽？为什么这些树木在失去大部分树皮的情况下仍能存活？为什么下层木受到的风小承受的重量比大型乔木轻为什么它们却如此强硬难以折断？大象是因为大象的存在它们才演化至此的比如说，在欧洲它们进化到能够抵挡直獠牙的大象古象，亚洲象属，是一种巨大的野兽它和亚洲大象有关系但它是一种温带的动物，一个温带森林生物比亚洲象健硕很多为什么我们常见的灌木长着看似煞费苦心生出的刺来阻止鹿的进食？或许它们进化至此是为了阻止犀牛进食
en:And even so, you can still see the shadowsof these great beasts in our current ecosystems.Why is it that so many deciduous treesare able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken?Why is it that they can withstand the lossof so much of their bark?Why do understory trees,which are subject to lower sheer forces from the windand have to carry less weightthan the big canopy trees,why are they so much tougher and harder to breakthan the canopy trees are?Elephants.They are elephant-adapted.In Europe, for example,they evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant,elephas antiquus, which was a great beast.It was related to the Asian elephant,but it was a temperate animal, a temperate forest creature.It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant.But why is it that some of our common shrubshave spines which seem to be over-engineeredto resist browsing by deer?Perhaps because they evolvedto resist browsing by rhinoceros.

en:Isn&#39;t it an amazing thoughtthat every time you wander into a parkor down an avenue or through a leafy street,you can see the shadows of these great beasts?Paleoecology, the study of past ecosystems,crucial to an understanding of our own,feels like a portal through which you may passinto an enchanted kingdom.And if we really are looking at areas of landof the sort of sizes I&#39;ve been talking about becoming available,why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna,or at least species closely related to thosewhich have become extinct everywhere?Why shouldn&#39;t all of ushave a Serengeti on our doorsteps?

en:And perhaps this is the most important thingthat rewilding offers us,the most important thing that&#39;s missing from our lives:hope.In motivating people to love and defend the natural world,an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair.The story rewilding tells usis that ecological change need not always proceedin one direction.It offers us the hopethat our silent springcould be replaced by a raucous summer.
