zh-cn:我今天所要谈的是我从1974年开始即有的经验那个戴着奇怪手套的人就是我那时我才17岁，我去参加和平示威游行当时我并不知道，我身旁的这些人大部份都是统一教的信徒（笑）不到一个礼拜他们就说服我耶稣已重返人间而文鲜明就是神祗的化身我是上帝的选民我注定要追随文鲜明
en:My journey to coming here todaystarted in 1974.That&#39;s me with the funny gloves.I was 17 and going on a peace walk.What I didn&#39;t know though, was most of those people, standing therewith me, were Moonies.(Laughter)And within a weekI had come to believethat the second coming of Christ had occurred,that it was Sun Myung Moon,and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by Godto be his disciple.

zh-cn:虽然听起来很酷我的家人知道后却对此不大感冒（笑）他们想尽办法地使我脱离那个教派在那个年代有一个秘密组织也许你们有些人还记得那个组织里的人被称为&quot;反洗脑者&quot;经过了漫长的五年我的家人终于成功地为我&quot;反洗脑&quot;了而我自己也成为&quot;反洗脑者&quot;我开始帮助被洗脑的当事人在做了将近五年的反洗脑工作后我因绑架罪名被逮捕我辅导的大部份当事人并非自愿接受反洗脑的这些当事人的家人得先为当事人找到安全的藏身地把他们安置在那里然后我们再去辅导，通常需持续一个礼拜左右经过被警方逮捕的事件后我决定不再从事这种工作
en:Now as cool as that sounds,my family was not that thrilled with this.(Laughter)And they tried everything they could to get me out of there.There was an underground railroad of sortsthat was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it.They were called deprogrammers.And after about five long yearsmy family had me deprogrammed.And I then became a deprogrammer.I started going out on cases.And after about five years of doing this,I was arrested for kidnapping.Most of the cases I went out onwere called involuntary.What happened was that the familyhad to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.And so they took them to some safe place.And we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.And so after this happened,I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work.

zh-cn:又过了大约 20年我脑中有个问题始终挥之不去那就是：“我到底怎么了？”或是说：“我的脑袋到底怎么了？”因为我的脑中的确产生了变化于是我决定要写一本回忆录记录我人生中被洗脑和反洗脑的那十年
en:And about 20 years went by.There was a burning question though that would not leave me.And that was, &quot;How did this happen to me?&quot;And in fact, what did happen to my brain?Because something did.And so I decided to write a book, a memoir,about this decade of my life.

zh-cn:当我快把书写完的时候有一部纪录片上映了是关于琼斯镇时间（70年代美国人民圣殿教集体自杀的发生地）我看了以后不禁毛骨悚然这些就是死于那次事件的人当天大约有900个人丧生其中大部份都是自杀妇女将毒药喂给自己的小孩她们眼睁睁地看着儿童们口吐白沫而死
en:And toward the end of writing that bookthere was a documentary that came out.It was on Jonestown.And it had a chilling effect on me.These are the dead in Jonestown.About 900 people died that day,most of them taking their own lives.Women gave poison to their babies,and watched foam come from their mouths as they died.

zh-cn:上面的照片是文鲜明(统一教)的信徒他们受到了救世主文鲜明的祝福配偶也都由文鲜明挑选好了下面的照片是信奉希特勒的青年军这是一个人肉炸弹客的断腿我很不愿意承认但又不得不承认的是我了解这些人我了解他们为什么会这样我懂他们的脑子我懂他们为什么会有那些想法而且我懂他们为什么会认为那些想法是对的事实上，当你陷入那种思考模式以后你会认为大屠杀是为了拯救世人
en:The top picture is a group of Mooniesthat have been blessed by their messiah.Their mates were chosen for them.The bottom picture is Hitler youth.This is the leg of a suicide bomber.The thing I had to admit to myself,with great repulsion,was that I get it.I understand how this could happen.I understand how someone&#39;s brain,how someone&#39;s mind can come to the placewhere it makes sense —in fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that —not to try to save the world through genocide.

zh-cn:这到底是什么样的心态？它是如何形成的？我又是如何看清一切我明白那其实是一种脑部中毒的现象在座有些人可能不太清楚这概念脑部中毒指的就是一种想法在人脑中不断分裂复制它会像病毒一样散播到别人的脑中而就像病毒的运作方式一样会传染给他人并造成莫大伤害抵抗力差的人更深受其害
en:And so what is this? How does this work?And how I&#39;ve come to view what happened to meis a viral, memetic infection.For those of you who aren&#39;t familiar with memetics,a meme has been defined asan idea that replicates in the human brainand moves from brain to brain like a virus,much like a virus. The way a virus works is —it can infect and do the most damage to someonewho has a compromised immune system.

zh-cn:1974年的我年轻又天真我迷失在自己的世界里且抱着过于理想主义的态度统一教的思想直观，好似能解决人生之问，让人非常向往尤其那时的心灵又容易受人影响在这种状况下思考逻辑如鬼打墙般走不出来我才会相信“文鲜明是上帝的化身”“上帝会解决世间所有问题”而我只要心悦诚服地追随他就好因为上帝会阻止战争和饥饿那也是我的理想我只要心悦诚服的追随他就好他是上帝派来的救世主，有他便天下太平这种想法渐渐根深柢固而这种想法最可怕之处在于它造成了&quot;我们&quot;和&quot;他们&quot;的对立&quot;对&quot;与&quot;错&quot;的对立&quot;正&quot;与&quot;邪&quot;的对立这让人什么事都做得出来一切的行为都被合理化
en:In 1974, I was young, I was naive,and I was pretty lost in my world.I was really idealistic.These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealingwhen you are emotionally vulnerable.What happens is thatcircular logic takes over.&quot;Moon is one with God.God is going to fix all the problems in the world.All I have to do is humbly follow.Because God is going to stop war and hunger —all these things I wanted to do —all I have to do is humbly follow.Because after all, God is [working through] the messiah. He&#39;s going to fix all this.&quot;It becomes impenetrable.And the most dangerous part of thisis that is creates &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them,&quot;&quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong,&quot;&quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil.&quot;And it makes anything possible,makes anything rationalizable.

zh-cn:但是如果当时有办法一窥我的脑部在我信奉统一教的那几年里不像现在有快速发展的神经科学正如雷·库兹韦尔昨天所说-科学正不断进步现在我们开始窥探人脑是如何运作的所以如果当时有办法一窥我的脑部或是将任何如这样思想中毒的脑子和在座任何人的脑子两相比较或是和习惯批判性思考的人脑做比较的话我相信两种脑子看起来一定非常不同
en:And the thing is, though,if you looked at my brainduring those years in the Moonies —neuroscience is expanding exponentially,as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.We&#39;re beginning to look inside the brain.And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that&#39;s infected witha viral memetic infection like this,and compared it to anyone in this room,or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis,I am convinced it would look very, very different.

zh-cn:在座各位或许会觉得我这么说很奇怪但这件事给了我希望我有了希望是因为我们做到了解决问题的第一步那就是：承认这个问题的确存在但这是个人的问题，或者说是科学的问题它存在于我们的脑中，并非是外来的邪恶力量要害我们所以透过研究和教育我相信这个问题是可以解决的而解决此问题的第一步就是明白我们需要一起努力不分彼此，永不对立谢谢大家 (掌声)
en:And that, strange as it may sound,gives me hope.And the reason that gives me hopeis that the first thing is to admitthat we have a problem.But it&#39;s a human problem. It&#39;s a scientific problem, if you will.It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.And so this is something that, through research and education,I believe that we can solve.And so the first step is to realizethat we can do this together,and that there is no &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them.&quot;Thank you very much. (Applause)
