zh-cn:在这个前提下，我想谈谈电子游戏。当我们说到电子游戏的时候，大多数人都会想到孩子。没错。90%的孩子的确玩电子游戏。但是说实话，当孩子们都睡着了，是谁在玩Play Station游戏机呢？是你们。电子游戏玩家的平均年龄是33岁，不是8岁。其实，如果我们看看对于未来电子游戏玩家的预测，未来的玩家将是中老年人。（笑）
en:This is in this context I&#39;m going to tell youabout video games. When we say video games,most of you think about children.It&#39;s true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.But let&#39;s be frank.When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old,not eight years old, and in fact, if we lookat the projected demographics of video game play,the video game players of tomorrow areolder adults. (Laughter)

zh-cn:由此看来电子游戏渗透在了我们的社会中。而它很明显的还会继续存在下去。它对于我们的日常生活有非常惊人的影响。这里列的是一些由美国动视公司公布的统计数据。在《使命召唤：黑暗行动》发布后的一个月内，它在全世界范围内的累积游戏时间就达到了六万八千年。如果把这些时间都用在做线性代数的题目上了，你们还会有抱怨吗？
en:So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impacton our everyday life. Consider these statisticsreleased by Activision. After one month of releaseof the game &quot;Call Of Duty: Black Ops,&quot; it had been playedfor 68,000 yearsworldwide, right?Would any of you complain if this was the caseabout doing linear algebra?
时间： 1:38
zh-cn:所以我们现在的问题就是如何利用这种惊人的能量。我们先退一步。我知道你们可能不少都有过下班回家发现孩子在玩这类游戏的经历。（射击噪音）这些游戏的目标一般就是在敌人、僵尸、坏人打倒你之前先打倒他们。我可以推测，你们可能大多都想过：“拜托，你就不能做点比射杀僵尸更能体现智商的事情吗？”但是如果你发现你的女儿在玩数独，或是儿子在读莎士比亚的时候，你还会有这样的条件反射吗？大多数家长们都会倍感欣慰。我不是要告诉你们成天玩游戏是对身体有益的。那是不健康的，而且过度沉迷永远不会是件好事。但我想要说服大家的是适量地玩玩我们刚才提到的游戏，就是那些动作射击游戏，对我们的反应在各种层面上有可观的正面影响。
en:So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?Now I want to step back a bit.I know most of you have had the experience of coming backhome and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to getafter your enemy zombie bad guysbefore they get to you, right?And I&#39;m almost sure most of you have thought,&quot;Oh, come on, can&#39;t you do something more intelligentthan shooting at zombies?&quot;I&#39;d like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reactionin the context of what you would have thoughtif you had found your girl playing sudokuor your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?Most parents would find that great.Well, I&#39;m not going to tell you that playing video gamesdays in and days out is actually good for your health.It&#39;s not, and binging is never good.But I&#39;m going to argue that in reasonable doses,actually the very game I showed you at the beginning,those action-packed shooter gameshave quite powerful effects and positive effectson many different aspects of our behavior.

zh-cn:几乎没哪个星期媒体不写几条关于电子游戏是好是坏的头条。你们被这样的信息轰炸着。我们现在先不谈这个适合闲来无事争论一下的话题，而是看看在实验室中得到的结果。我们在实验室里的工作就是直接准确地测试、量化电子游戏对于大脑的影响。我想要举几个我们在研究中发现的例子。
en:There&#39;s not one week that goes without some majorheadlines in the media about whether video games aregood or bad for you, right? You&#39;re all bombarded with that.I&#39;d like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion asideand get you to actually step into the lab.What we do in the lab is actually measure directly,in a quantitative fashion, what is the impactof video games on the brain.And so I&#39;m going to take a few examples from our work.
时间： 3:25
zh-cn:这第一个说法，我想大多数人都听说过：看太久屏幕会导致视力下降。这是个关于视力的说法。也许你们中有人是视觉方面的专家，我们知道如何检验这个说法。我们可以在实验室中测出你的视力到底怎么样。你猜结果怎么样？不经常玩游戏也不经常看屏幕的人视力正常，或者说定义为正常。这没什么问题。现在我们要关注的是那些每周花5个小时，10个小时，15个小时沉迷于游戏的那些人。根据刚才的说法这些人的视力应该很差，对吗？你猜怎么着？这些人的视力居然非常好。甚至比那些不玩游戏的人视力还要好。他们视力好体现在两个方面。其一是他们可以在杂乱中看到细节。也就是说在看药品说明上的小字的时候不需要放大镜，靠肉眼就能看清。其二是他们能够分辨不同的灰度。想象一下你在大雾中开车。有分辨灰度的能力能够让你分辨前方汽车，意味着你是否能避免车祸的发生。我们现在正在用这个发现开发游戏帮助视力不好的病人重新训练他们的大脑，让他们能看得更好。通过研究我们很明显地发现，对于玩动作电子游戏的人来说，玩游戏的时间长并不意味着视力变差。
en:One first saying that I&#39;m sure you all have heardis the fact that too much screen timemakes your eyesight worse.That&#39;s a statement about vision.There may be vision scientists among you.We actually know how to test that statement.We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.Well, guess what? People that don&#39;t play a lotof action games, that don&#39;t actually spend a lot of timein front of screens, have normal, or what we callcorrective-to-normal vision. That&#39;s okay.The issue is what happens with these guys that actuallyindulge into playing video games like five hours per week,10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.It&#39;s better than those that don&#39;t play.And it&#39;s better in two different ways.The first way is that they&#39;re actually able to resolvesmall detail in the context of clutter, and though that meansbeing able to read the fine print on a prescriptionrather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do itwith just your eyesight.The other way that they are better is actually being ableto resolve different levels of gray.Imagine you&#39;re driving in a fog. That makes a differencebetween seeing the car in front of youand avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.So we&#39;re actually leveraging that work to develop gamesfor patients with low vision, and to have an impacton retraining their brain to see better.Clearly, when it comes to action video games,screen time doesn&#39;t make your eyesight worse.
时间： 5:04
zh-cn:另一个我相信大家都听说过的说法是电子游戏会让人难以集中注意力。我们知道怎么在实验室中测量一个人注意力的集中程度。我将带给大家一个测量的例子。我希望大家都能参与进来，所以需要大家一起和我做这个游戏。我将展示一些有颜色的单词。我希望大家大声说出字体的颜色。明白了吗？马上是第一个例子。（“椅子”）橙色，很好。（“桌子”）绿色。（“木板”）红色。（“马”）达芙妮 芭菲莉亚：黄色。观众：黄色（“黄色”）达芙妮 芭菲莉亚：红色。观众：货色。（“蓝色”）达芙妮 芭菲莉亚：黄色。大家明白我做这个游戏的意思了吧？（笑声）你们做得越来越好，但是这还是很难。为什么会觉得难？因为在这个游戏里文字本身的意思和它字体的颜色是矛盾的。你的注意力有多集中决定了你能多快解决这个矛盾。所以状态最佳的年轻人们会比我们中有些年龄大些的表现好一点。我们会发现如果普通人和经常玩游戏的人一起做这个游戏的时候，经常玩动作电子游戏的人能更快地处理其中的矛盾。所以很明显地，玩动作电子游戏不会导致注意力产生问题或是更容易分心。
en:Another saying that I&#39;m sure you have all heard around:Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.I&#39;m actually going to give you an example of how we do so.I&#39;m going to ask you to participate, so you&#39;re going to haveto actually play the game with me. I&#39;m going to show youcolored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.Right? So this is the first example.[&quot;Chair&quot;]Orange, good. [&quot;Table&quot;] Green.[&quot;Board&quot;] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red.[&quot;Horse&quot;] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow.[&quot;Yellow&quot;] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.[&quot;Blue&quot;] DB: Yellow.Okay, you get my point, right? (Laughter)You&#39;re getting better, but it&#39;s hard. Why is it hard?Because I introduced a conflict betweenthe word itself and its color.How good your attention is determines actually how fastyou resolve that conflict, so the young guys hereat the top of their game probably, like, did a little betterthan some of us that are older.What we can show is that when you do this kind of taskwith people that play a lot of action games,they actually resolve the conflict faster.So clearly playing those action games doesn&#39;t leadto attention problems.
时间： 6:24
zh-cn:事实上，动作电子游戏的玩家在注意力方面还有很多其他优势。其中之一得到提高的是能够更好地追踪周围的物体。这个能力我们很多时候都会用到。开车的时候你在追踪，追踪着周围的车子。你也在追踪着行人和奔跑着的狗，做到了这点才能安全驾驶，对吗？
en:Actually, those action video game players havemany other advantages in terms of attention, and oneaspect of attention which is also improved for the betteris our ability to track objects around in the world.This is something we use all the time. When you&#39;re driving,you&#39;re tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.You&#39;re also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog,and that&#39;s how you can actually be safe driving, right?
时间： 6:48
zh-cn:在实验室里，我们会找人到实验室里，坐在电脑屏幕前，然后给他们些小任务，我将要让大家再做一遍相同的小任务。你们将要看到黄色的笑脸和一些蓝色的哭脸。这代表了冬天日内瓦的孩子们课间在操场上玩。大多数孩子很开心因为下课了，但是还是有几个不太开心用蓝色代表，因为他们忘记穿外套了。这些孩子开始到处移动，而你们的任务就是记住谁一开始有外套，谁没有。现在的这个例子里面只有一个哭脸。这很简单因为你可以用眼睛追踪着它。你看着它，看着它，然后它停住了，上面有一个问号。我的问题是，这个孩子有外套吗？这张脸一开始是黄色的还是蓝色的？我听到了几个人说是黄色的，很好，大家还是有点儿头脑的。（笑声）现在我们再做一遍，不过这次加大点难度，有三个蓝色的脸。不要看其他地方，千万不要看其他的地方。不要移动你的目光，尽量使用你的余光，集中注意力。只有这样你才能成功。如果你移动了你的眼睛就肯定失败了。黄色还是蓝色？观众：黄色。达芙妮 芭菲莉亚：很好。一般普通年轻人的注意范围大概是三到四个物体。就像我们刚才看到的那样。而动作电子游戏的玩家一次可以注意到六到七个物体。像这个视频里一样。轮到你们大显神通了，游戏玩家们。有点挑战性了，对吗？黄色的还是蓝色的？的确是蓝色的。在座的有些人很有一手嘛！（笑声）很好！
en:In the lab, we get people to come to the lab,sit in front of a computer screen, and we give themlittle tasks that I&#39;m going to get you to do again.You&#39;re going to see yellow happy facesand a few sad blue faces. These are childrenin the schoolyard in Geneva during a recessduring the winter. Most kids are happy. It&#39;s actually recess.But a few kids are sad and blue because they&#39;ve forgotten their coat.Everybody begins to move around, and your taskis to keep track of who had a coat at the beginningand who didn&#39;t. So I&#39;m just going to show you an examplewhere there is only one sad kid. It&#39;s easy because you canactually track it with your eyes. You can track,you can track, and then when it stops, and there isa question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?Was it yellow initially or blue?I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter)I&#39;m now going to ask you to do the task, but now witha little more challenging task. There are going to bethree of them that are blue. Don&#39;t move your eyes.Please don&#39;t move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixatedand expand, pull your attention. That&#39;s the only wayyou can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you&#39;re doomed.Yellow or blue?Audience: Yellow.DB: Good.So your typical normal young adultcan have a span of about three or four objects of attention.That&#39;s what we just did. Your action video game playerhas a span of about six to seven objects of attention,which is what is shown in this video here.That&#39;s for you guys, action video game players.A bit more challenging, right? (Laughter)Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some peoplethat are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter)

zh-cn:我们可以直接看到电子游戏对于人反应的影响，同样的，我们也可以通过脑成像技术看看电子游戏对大脑的影响。我们看到很多改变，但是最主要的变化还是表现在大脑控制注意力的部分。其中之一是众所周知控制注意力方面的大脑顶叶皮层。还有一个则是控制我们如何保持注意力的大脑额叶。另有一个是控制我们如何分配和调节注意力以及处理矛盾的前扣带皮层。现在，当我们做脑成像的时候，我们会发现游戏玩家大脑的这三个神经网络结构都比一般人的更有效率。
en:Good. So in the same way that we actually seethe effects of video games on people&#39;s behavior,we can use brain imaging and look at the impactof video games on the brain, and we do find many changes,but the main changes are actually to the brain networksthat control attention. So one part is the parietal cortexwhich is very well known to control the orientation of attention.The other one is the frontal lobe, which controlshow we sustain attention, and another oneis the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocateand regulate attention and resolve conflict.Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all threeof these networks are actually much more efficientin people that play action games.
时间： 9:15
zh-cn:这些使我从文献中找到了关于科技和大脑违背一般人常识的发现。你们都知道&quot;多任务处理&quot;(multitasking)。一边开车一边拿起手机的多任务处理不是明智之举。非常糟糕。为什么？因为你的注意力实际上转移到了你的手机上，于是不能对前面的车况做出敏捷的反应。所以你出车祸的可能性大大增加了。现在我们可以在实验室中测量这种能力。我们当然不会让人开着车到处跑然后看看会出几场车祸。这个方案代价有点高。但是我们可以通过特殊设计的电脑程序精确到以毫秒为单位测量考察人们能多快地在不同任务间切换。当我们做这样的实验的时候，我们发现玩很多动作电子游戏的人完成得真的非常非常好。他们在任务间的切换非常快速敏捷。他们所付出的代价很小。
en:This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive findingin the literature about technology and the brain.You all know about multitasking. You all have been faultyof multitasking when you&#39;re drivingand you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone,you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftlyto the car braking in front of you, and so you&#39;remuch more likely to get engaged into a car accident.Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.We obviously don&#39;t ask people to drive around and seehow many car accidents they have. That would be a littlecostly proposition. But we design tasks on the computerwhere we can measure, to millisecond accuracy,how good they are at switching from one task to another.When we do that, we actually find that peoplethat play a lot of action games are really, really good.They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.
时间：10:19
zh-cn:现在，我希望大家记住这个结论，把它带入到另外一群科技使用者的背景下。这些可以“多媒体任务处理”（multimediatasking）的人相当受社会推崇。什么叫“多媒体任务处理”？我们中的很多人还有很多孩子都会一边听着音乐一边上网搜索信息一边和朋友在脸谱网上聊天。这就是可以“多媒体任务处理”的人。有一个试验由斯坦福的研究人员们先做，我们又进行了重复试验过的研究表明被认为是高效的“多媒体任务处理者”多任务处理的能力非常糟糕。他们在实验室里被测量的表现真的很差。
en:Now I&#39;d like you to remember that result, and put itin the context of another group of technology users,a group which is actually much revered by society,which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.What is multimedia-tasking? It&#39;s the fact that most of us,most of our children, are engaged with listening to musicat the same time as they&#39;re doing search on the webat the same time as they&#39;re chatting on Facebook with their friends.That&#39;s a multimedia-tasker.There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanfordand that we replicated that showed thatthose people that identify as being high multimedia-taskersare absolutely abysmal at multitasking.When we measure them in the lab, they&#39;re really bad.
时间：11:05
zh-cn:这样的结果主要说明了两个问题。第一，不是所有的媒体都生来平等。不能比较多媒体处理对人的影响和玩动作电子游戏对人的影响进行比较。他们对于认知，知觉和注意力的影响都是完全不同的。就算是在电子游戏之中，我指的是动作电子游戏中，不同的游戏对你的大脑的影响也是不同的。所以我们需要在实验室中测量每个游戏的影响分别是什么。
en:Right? So these kinds of results reallymakes two main points.The first one is that not all media are created equal.You can&#39;t compare the effect of multimedia-taskingand the effect of playing action games. They havetotally different effects on different aspects of cognition,perception and attention.Even within video games, I&#39;m telling you right nowabout these action-packed video games.Different video games have a different effect on your brains.So we actually need to step into the lab and really measurewhat is the effect of each video game.
时间：11:40
zh-cn:第二，所谓的常识很多时候是不靠谱的。像我刚才讲到的虽然动作电子游戏的玩家长时间看屏幕，但他们的视力依然很好就是例子之一。现在最让人担忧的是那些常常多媒体任务处理的大学生们深信他们表现得很好。你把他们的数据给他们看，告诉他们其实他们表现得不怎么样，但是他们觉得那根本不可能。他们却觉得实际上自己做得非常非常好。这也是为什么我们需要在实验室里真正地去测量科技对于大脑的影响。
en:The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact thatdespite a lot of screen time, those action gamershave a lot of very good vision, etc.Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduatesthat actually report engaging in a lot of highmultimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.So you show them their data, you show them they are badand they&#39;re like, &quot;Not possible.&quot; You know, they havethis sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.That&#39;s another argument for why we need to step into the laband really measure the impact of technology on the brain.
时间：12:21
zh-cn:从某种意义上来说，我们可以认为电子游戏对于大脑的影响和酒对于健康的影响很相似。喝酒可能会造成很糟糕的结果，玩电子游戏也是。但是如果在年龄合适的时候适当地喝一些，酒可以很有利于健康。实际上，红酒已经被鉴定出含有能让人延年益寿的分子。同样的，动作电子游戏里也有能对大脑的可塑性，学习，注意力，视力等方方面面有非常有力影响的成分。所以我们现在需要做也正在做的就是了解这些积极的成分，然后为了教育或病人的复原真正地利用它们开发出更好的游戏。
en:Now in a sense, when we think about the effectof video games on the brain, it&#39;s very similarto the effect of wine on the health.There are some very poor uses of wine. There are somevery poor uses of video games. But when consumedin reasonable doses, and at the right age,wine can be very good for health. There are actuallyspecific molecules that have been identifiedin red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.So it&#39;s the same way, like those action video gameshave a number of ingredients that are actually reallypowerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention,vision, etc., and so we need and we&#39;re working onunderstanding what are those active ingredients so thatwe can really then leverage them to deliver better games,either for education or for rehabilitation of patients.
时间：13:18
zh-cn:既然我们关注的是对于教育和病人复原造成影响，我们并不太关心那些连续玩很多个小时电子游戏的人的表现。我更感兴趣的是从你们中随便选一个人然后证明强迫你玩动作游戏能提高你的视力，不管你到底想不想玩动作游戏。这也是医疗康复和教育的重点。大多数孩子不会上学的时候说&quot;太棒了！能上两个小时的数学课！&quot;
en:Now because we are interested in having an impactfor education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actuallynot that interested in how those of you that chooseto play video games for many hours on end perform.I&#39;m much more interested in taking any of youand showing that by forcing you to play an action game,I can actually change your vision for the better,whether you want to play that action game or not, right?That&#39;s the point of rehabilitation or education.Most of the kids don&#39;t go to school saying,&quot;Great, two hours of math!&quot;
时间：13:52
zh-cn:这也是做研究的难题，为了解决它，我们要往前再进一步。而这往前的一步就是训练研究。让我通过一个叫做“心智旋转”的任务告诉大家这一步到底是什么。心智旋转是一个要你们观察这个形状的任务，这一次也需要大家都参与进来。看着它，这是我们的目标形状。现在我给你们看四个不同的形状。这四个中的一个是由这个形状旋转得到的。我希望你们能告诉我是哪一个。第一个，第二个，第三个还是第四个？好吧，这次我先公布答案，是第四个。再来一次。让你们的脑子动起来。这个是我们的目标形状。第三个。很好！这有点难是吗？我让大家做这个小游戏就是因为它能让你们感到头脑在打结。这和玩不需要动脑子的动作电子游戏感觉不太一样。
en:So that&#39;s really the crux of the research, and to do that,we need to go one more step.And one more step is to do training studies.So let me illustrate that step witha task which is called mental rotation.Mental rotation is a task where I&#39;m going to ask you,and again you&#39;re going to do the task,to look at this shape. Study it, it&#39;s a target shape,and I&#39;m going to present to you four different shapes.One of these four different shapes is actually a rotatedversion of this shape. I want you to tell me which one:the first one, second one, third one or fourth one?Okay, I&#39;ll help you. Fourth one.One more. Get those brains working. Come on.That&#39;s our target shape.Third. Good! This is hard, right?Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is becauseyou really feel your brain cringing, right?It doesn&#39;t really feel like playing mindless action video games.
时间：14:57
zh-cn:我们在训练研究中做的就是让来实验室的人完成和这个任务类似的任务，然后我们强迫他们玩十个小时的动作游戏。不是连续玩十个小时而是分散地玩，比如说在两周内的几天里每天花上40分钟。然后等他们完成了训练，几天后再到实验室并被测试相似类型的心智旋转任务的完成情况。这个工作是我们一个多伦多的同事完成的。他们发现一开始参加实验的人的表现和他们那个年龄段应有的差不多。玩了两个星期的动作电子游戏以后，他们的表现变得更好了。这个提高在训练后的五个月后仍然有体现。这一点非常非常重要。为什么？因为就像我说的我们想要把这些游戏用在教育和医疗康复上。这需要效果能够持久存在。
en:Well, what we do in these training studies is, peoplecome to the lab, they do tasks like this one,we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.They don&#39;t play 10 hours of action games in a row.They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutesseveral days over a period of two weeks.Then, once they are done with the training, they come backa few days later and they are tested again on a similar typeof mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleaguein Toronto. What they showed is that, initially,you know, subjects perform where they are expectedto perform given their age. After two weeks of trainingon action video games, they actually perform better,and the improvement is still there five months afterhaving done the training. That&#39;s really, really important.Why? Because I told you we want to use these gamesfor education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effectsthat are going to be long-lasting.

zh-cn:现在，你们中的不少人大概在想：&quot;你们还在等什么？为什么不快点发行一款像是对我祖母的注意力有帮助而且让她喜欢的游戏，或者是一款能使眼睛弱视的孙子视力复原的游戏？&quot;
en:Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wonderingwell, what are you waiting for, to put on the marketa game that would be good for the attentionof my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy,or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the visionof my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?
时间：16:15
zh-cn:我们在努力，但是有一个挑战。有一些像我一样的脑科学家开始了解游戏中能带来积极效果的成分，我把这叫做等式的花椰菜侧。而娱乐软件产业总能敏锐地开发出让人无法抗拒地产品。这是等式的巧克力侧。问题是我们怎么把这两者结合起来，这个过程有点像是各种食材的搭配。有谁会想吃沾着巧克力的花椰菜吗？没有人。（笑声）你们可能有过这种感受，当你们开始玩一个教育游戏，然后感觉到，怎么说呢，它并不好玩也没那么引人入胜。所以我们真正需要的是一种新牌子的巧克力，一种让人无法抗拒的巧克力。让你想吃的同时包含了所有应该有的成分，那些从花椰菜中提取出来已经尝不出来但仍然对大脑有作用的有益成分。我们正在朝这个方向努力，但是这需要脑科学家，娱乐软件界的人们和发行商的合作。这些人一般不怎么聚到一起，但这样的合作是能做到的，而我们的工作已经上了轨道。今天我就以这个想法结束，谢谢大家关注。（掌声）（掌声）
en:Well, we&#39;re working on it, but here is a challenge.There are brain scientists like me that are beginningto understand what are the good ingredients in gamesto promote positive effects, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m goingto call the broccoli side of the equation.There is an entertainment software industrywhich is extremely deft at coming up withappealing products that you can&#39;t resist.That&#39;s the chocolate side of the equation.The issue is we need to put the two together,and it&#39;s a little bit like with food.Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?None of you. (Laughter) And you probably have hadthat feeling, right, picking up an education gameand sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it&#39;s not really fun,it&#39;s not really engaging. So what we needis really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolatethat is irresistible, that you really want to play,but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredientsthat are extracted from the broccoli that you can&#39;t recognizebut are still working on your brains. And we&#39;re working on it,but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together,people that work in the entertainment software industry,and publishers, so these are not people that usuallymeet every day, but it&#39;s actually doable,and we are on the right track.I&#39;d like to leave you with that thought,and thank you for your attention.
