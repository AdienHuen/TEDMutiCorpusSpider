zh-cn:我叫瑞恩罗勃最近10年间，我在世界各地参与纪录片的摄制工作制作这些影片的过程中我开始不自觉的拍摄照片这举动常引起摄像师不满
en:My name is Ryan Lobo,and I&#39;ve been involved in the documentaryfilmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years.During the process of making these filmsI found myself taking photographs,often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.

zh-cn:但我发现我几乎是情不自禁的想拍照并且在按下快门的那一霎那，我常觉得比起一部偶尔令人动容的纪录片我的照片讲述了一个更好的故事我觉得，拍照可以让我把握住那些真实的东西不管它们是否有资格提上议事日程或是牵涉政治2007年里，我去过三个战区我到过伊拉克、阿富汗和利比里亚(西非国家)在那里，我切身的体验到了当地人所遭受的痛苦我让自己也沉浸在了一些紧张曲折并且令人动容的故事之中当然有的时候，我也非常担心自己的生命受到威胁
en:I found this photography of mine almost compulsive.And at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel thatI had photographs that told a better storythan a sometimes-sensational documentary.I felt, when I had my photographs,that I was holding on to something true,regardless of agendas or politics.In 2007, I traveled to three war zones.I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.And over there I experiencedother people&#39;s suffering, up close and personal,immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories,and at times I experienced great fear for my own life.

zh-cn:通常，我会回到班加罗尔（印度城市）并时常在朋友家中进行激烈的讨论我们会讨论各式各样的问题可是他们总狠狠抱怨新酒吧营业时间说是在那儿喝上一杯的钱要比他们付给14岁女仆的工钱还多在这样儿的争论中，我会感觉非常孤立但同时，我质问自己质问自己的诚实以及讲述那些故事的真正目的之后，我决定需有所妥协就像那些争论中的我的朋友们那样争论来争论去讲不着边际的话不过是给自己寻找借口而不是为了承担责任
en:As always, I would return to Bangalore,and often to animated discussions at friend&#39;s homes,where we would discuss various issueswhile they complained bitterly about the new pub timings,where a drink often cost more than what they&#39;d paidtheir 14-year-old maid.I would feel very isolated during these discussions.But at the same time, I questioned myselfand my own integrity and purpose in storytelling.And I decided that I had compromised,just like my friends in those discussions,where we told storiesin contexts we made excuses for,rather than taking responsibility for.

zh-cn:我不会详述使我作出这个决定的原因不过可以简单概括成，酒精、香烟一些其它的东西和女人（笑声）基本上我认为只有我自己本身而不是相机或网络也不是其他外界事物我自己本身才是讲述故事时，唯一一件真正值得调弦的乐器在我的生活里，当我努力想达成某个目标比如想取得成功或是得到认同的时候，它们反倒躲着我相反，当我放开这些所谓目标从一个充满着关怀同情和美好志向的地方起步当我追求卓越，而不仅仅是追求结果的时候所有之前追求的所谓目标反倒不期而至的达成了，包括成功
en:I won&#39;t go into details about what led to a decision I made,but let&#39;s just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes,other substances and a woman.(Laughter)I basically decided that it was I,not the camera or the network,or anything that lay outside myself,that was the only instrument in storytellingtruly worth tuning.In my life, when I tried to achieve thingslike success or recognition, they eluded me.Paradoxically, when I let go of these objectives,and worked from a place of compassion and purpose,looking for excellence, rather than the results of it,everything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.

zh-cn:摄影艺术是超越文化的，包括我们自己的文化对于我来说，摄影就是一种语言，它描述出我们无法触及难以理解的事物它给予故事本身以及故事中人物原本所没有的发言权现在我邀你一同经历我刚经历的三个故事都是关于看事物的角度我觉得在故事讲述过程中所展示的义理我更愿意称之为宽容同情
en:Photography transcended culture, including my own.And it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible,and gives voice to people and stories without.I invite you into three recent stories of mine,which are about this way of looking, if you will,which I believe exemplify the tenetsof what I like to call compassion in storytelling.

zh-cn:2007年，我去了利比里亚在那里，我和一群朋友制作了一部自己出资的独立电影，当然现在仍在制作中它是一部极具传奇色彩却是关于残忍军阀的电影其中的残忍军阀被称作做光屁股将军他的真名叫约书亚。他是在牢房里接受我们拍摄的在那个过去他用来折磨并屠杀平民的牢房其中也包括孩子约书亚声称在利比里亚内战中曾亲手杀死了超过10，000人他之所以得到那个外号是由于常常打仗时赤身裸体另外，他也许是现今世上杀人最多的谋杀犯中仍苟延残喘的一个
en:In 2007 I went to Liberia,where a group of my friends and Idid an independent, self-funded film, still in progress,on a very legendary and brutal war-lordnamed General Butt Naked.His real name is Joshua, and he&#39;s pictured here in a cellwhere he once used to torture and murder people,including children.Joshua claims to have personally killedmore than 10,000 people during Liberia&#39;s civil war.He got his name from fighting stark naked.And he is probably the most prolific mass murdereralive on Earth today.

zh-cn:这位妇女曾亲眼看见这个将军杀死自己的兄弟约书亚还命令他的童子军犯下了罄竹难书的罪行并强迫他们以一种极残忍的形式执行他的命令现在，很多当时的童子军都已染上毒瘾，比如海洛因而且他们穷困潦倒，好比相片中的这些年轻人你要怎样活下去如果你清楚自己曾经犯下可怕的罪行如今，这位将军已经受洗成为一位基督教传教士并且他正在执行使命
en:This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother.Joshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes,and enforced his command with great brutality.Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin,and they are destitute, like these young men in the image.How do you live with yourselfif you know you&#39;ve committed horrific crimes?Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist.And he&#39;s on a mission.

zh-cn:我们陪着约书亚，踏上路途，去拜访那些他曾烧杀抢掠过的村庄他祈求原谅说一定会努力改善那些童子军的生活这次的远行，我总感觉我们会连同他一起被立刻杀掉但我所看到的使我真切的理解了宽恕的意义在此之前我从未认为这种事可能发生身处难以置信的穷困，遭受了巨大的损失那些可以说一无所有的人们却宽恕了这个罪人尽管他曾夺走了他们的一切他乞求原谅就得到了刚才提到的那位妇女的原谅尽管这位妇女和约书亚有着杀兄之仇塞内加尔，坐在轮椅上的这位年轻人曾经是童子军中一员，听从这位将军的指令直到他违背了命令将军用枪射断了他的双腿在这张照片中，他同样原谅了这位将军约书亚冒着生命危险走向受害者的家人们
en:We accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth,visiting villages where he had once killed and raped.He seeked forgiveness,and he claims to endeavor to improvethe lives of his child-soldiers.During this expedition I expected himto be killed outright, and us as well.But what I saw opened my eyesto an idea of forgivenesswhich I never thought possible.In the midst of incredible poverty and loss,people who had nothing absolved a manwho had taken everything from them.He begs for forgiveness,and receives it from the same womanwhose brother he murdered.Senegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here,was once a child soldier, under the General&#39;s command,until he disobeyed orders,and the General shot off both his legs.He forgives the General in this image.He risked his life as he walked up to peoplewhose families he&#39;d murdered.

zh-cn:在这张照片中，贫民窟中一群人围住了他，充满敌意但是约书亚保持沉默就算人们朝他发泄他们的愤怒这张照片，对于我来说，无疑算得上莎翁剧本中的一幕：一个深受各种势力影响的人拼命地想把握住自身中一些真实的东西处在这样的痛苦之中，他变为现在的样子
en:In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him.And Joshua remains silentas they vented their rage against him.This image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play,with a man, surrounded by various influences,desperate to hold on to something true within himself,in a context of great suffering that he has created himself.
时间： 5:31
zh-cn:我被所见所感深深打动但问题是宽恕和补救能否取代正义？约书亚说他不害怕站上自己罪行的审判台他在蒙罗维亚(利比里亚首都)演讲时也谈到了这些演讲时，听众中常有他的受害者看上去他并不是一个合适的人选来宣传政教分离的主张
en:I was intensely moved during all this.But the question is,does forgiveness and redemption replace justice?Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mindstanding trial for his crimes,and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia,to an audience that often includes his victims.A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea ofseparation of church and state.

zh-cn:第二个故事中，我将要为你们讲述一群非常特别的女兵她们拥有相当独特的维和技巧利比里亚在一场全非洲最血腥的内战之后已是满目疮痍在这场内战中，超过200,000人死亡成千上万的女性在无数强奸以及其他犯罪事件的阴影下惶惶不可终日利比里亚现在是所有联合国维和部队中印度女性的家
en:The second story I&#39;m going to tell you aboutis about a group of very special fighting womenwith rather unique peace-keeping skills.Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa&#39;sbloodiest civil wars,which has left more than 200,000 people dead,thousands of women scarred by rape and crimeon a spectacular scale.Liberia is now hometo an all-woman United Nations contingentof Indian peacekeepers.

zh-cn:这些女性，大多来自印度的小城镇远离故乡和家人到各处帮助维持和平她们更多的选择协商及容忍的方式而不是以武力解决问题指挥官告诉我，女性能比男性更好的判断出潜在的暴力局面并且毫无疑问，她们更能以一种非暴力的方式淡化这种局面这个男人醉得一塌糊涂他似乎对我的相机非常感兴趣直到他注意到抓住他那位女兵面带笑容，当然，手握上膛的AK-47（笑声）
en:These women, many from small towns in India,help keep the peace, far away from home and family.They use negotiation and tolerancemore often than an armed response.The commander told me that a woman could gaugea potentially violent situationmuch better than men.And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.This man was very drunk,and he was very interested in my camera,until he noticed the women, who handled himwith smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.(Laughter)
时间： 6:50
zh-cn:这个小分队似乎比较走运她们之中还没有人在战乱中身亡尽管很多维和人员在利比里亚牺牲是的，所有被杀的人都是男性很多女性维和人员都已结婚并有了孩子她们说，被分配部署后最难熬的便是必须与她们的孩子分离
en:This contingent seems to be quite lucky,and it has not sustained any casualties,even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.And yes, all of those people killed were male.Many of the women are married with children,and they say the hardest part of their deploymentwas being kept away from their children.

zh-cn:我陪同她们一起巡逻看着她们与男人们擦肩而过许多男人经过时不住地粗言秽语着当我向她们之中的一位问起这种令人震惊和畏惧的反应时她说：“不用担心，我们家那儿也是这样的我们知道怎么对付这些家伙”无视他们
en:I accompanied these women on their patrols,and watched as they walked past men,many who passed very lewd comments incessantly.And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response,she said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, same thing back home.We know how to deal with these fellows,&quot;and ignored them.

zh-cn:在这个被一切针对女性的暴力行径所毁坏的国家中印度维和部队鼓舞了很多当地女性她们纷纷加入警察部门其实有时候，当战争结束，摄制组也已离开那些最振奋人心的故事就活生生的在雷达下上演我回到印度，没人有兴趣出版这个故事一位编辑告诉我说，她没兴趣制作一部她所谓的“讲体力活儿的故事”
en:In a country ravaged by violence against women,Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local womento join the police force.Sometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left,the most inspiring stories are the onesthat float just beneath the radar.I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.And one editor told me that she wasn&#39;t interestedin doing what she called &quot;manual labor stories.&quot;

zh-cn:在2007年和2009年，我在德里消防中心拍摄每当夏天来临，那里算得上是世界上最忙碌的消防中心仅仅2个月，他们就接到了超过5000次火警这一切都是在后勤难以置信的不利状况下完成的比如高温酷热和交通堵塞在这次拍摄中，一些令人惊叹的事情发生了由于交通堵塞，我们到达的有些迟着火的是一个很大的贫民窟当我们快接近的时候，愤怒的人群开始攻击消防车几百人从四面八方向着消防车扔石头消防员们非常惊慌因为暴民不断攻击着消防车
en:In 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS,which, during the summer, is probably the world&#39;s most active fire department.They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months.And all this against incredible logistical odds,like heat and traffic jams.Something amazing happened during this shoot.Due to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum,a large slum, which had caught fire.As we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucksand stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place.These men were terrified,as the mob attacked our vehicle.
时间： 8:28
zh-cn:尽管如此，消防员们不顾人群的敌意他们离开车辆，然后成功的扑灭了火焰一些消防员冒险穿过了充满敌意的人群一些人头戴摩托车头盔以防伤害有些当地人从消防员手中强行抢过水管来扑灭自家房屋的火焰几百栋房屋被烧毁但回旋在我脑海中的问题是人们为什么要攻击消防车为什么要攻击去帮他们扑灭火焰的消防车？他们狂暴的怒气又是从何而来？我们对此有什么责任？德里市的1千4百万居民中有45%住在非法的贫民窟那里总是过于拥挤他们缺乏那些哪怕是最基础的生活设施这个也是所有大城市共同存在的问题
en:But nonetheless, despite the hostility,firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds,and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury.Some of the local people forcibly took away the hosesfrom the firemen to put out the fire in their homes.Now, hundreds of homes were destroyed.But the question that lingered in my mind was,what causes people to destroy fire trucksheaded to their own homes?Where does such rage come from?And how are we responsible for this?45 percent of the 14 million peoplewho live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums,which are chronically overcrowded.They lack even the most basic amenities.And this is something that is common to all our big cities.

zh-cn:话题再回到德里消防中心。有一个巨大的化学物品仓库着火了几千筒石化产品正在猛烈燃烧并且在身边爆炸火场的温度太高，以至于要用水管来给消防员降温这些消防员极其接近火焰，却没有穿能保护他们的防火服在印度，我们热衷于抱怨我们的政府机构但在这里，德里消防中心的总部R.C. Sharman先生和A.K. Sharman先生带领着他们的手下不断执行着消防任务在一个如此棒的国家下体力劳动却如此被轻视（掌声）
en:Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire,thousands of drums filled with petrochemicalswere blazing away and exploding all around us.The heat was so intense, that hoses were usedto cool down firefightersfighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing.In India we often love to complain about our government bodies.But over here, the heads of the DFS,Mr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman,led the firefight with their men.Something wonderful in a country wheremanual labor is often looked down upon.(Applause)

zh-cn:多年来，我坚信一段故事带来震撼的信念曾经动摇并且我甚至极度怀疑它的功效以及我对人性的信心然而，我们拍摄的纪录片还是在国家地理频道上面播出了当它播出的时候，我接到了当时所有工作人员的电话他们都告诉我，他们接到了上百个表示祝贺的电话一些消防员告诉我，他们很受鼓舞会努力做到更好，因为他们非常开心收到的是感谢而不是飞来板砖
en:Over the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.And I&#39;ve had very serious doubt about its efficacy,and my own faith in humanity.However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was withand they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspiredto do better because they were so pleasedto get thank-yous rather than brick bats.

zh-cn:这个故事似乎改变了人们对德里消防部的看法至少是电视屏幕前的部分观众杂志的一些读者以及那些家里没着火的人有时，关注那些关于勇敢，美好和崇高的故事无论其内容是什么都有助于在三方面上进一步发扬这些无形的品质让这些品质永存于故事主角中、永存于听众还有讲述者心中这就是故事叙述所蕴含的力量关注故事中高尚、勇敢和美好的东西那么这些品质也定会升华发扬开来。谢谢(掌声)
en:It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS,at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions,read magazines and whose huts aren&#39;t on fire.Sometimes, focusing on what&#39;s heroic, beautiful and dignified,regardless of the context,can help magnify these intangibles three ways,in the protagonist of the story, in the audience,and also in the storyteller.And that&#39;s the power of storytelling.Focus on what&#39;s dignified, courageous and beautiful,and it grows. Thank you.(Applause)
