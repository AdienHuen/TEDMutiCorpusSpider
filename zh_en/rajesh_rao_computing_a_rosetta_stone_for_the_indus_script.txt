zh-cn:首先，我们来做个思考的实验想像距今4000年后我们所了解的文明不复存在没有书籍没有电子设备没有脸书没有推特英语和英语字母也都消失殆尽现在再来想想考古学家们在我们城市残砖碎瓦中挖掘他们会发现什么呢？可能会发现长方形的塑胶上面印着奇怪的符号或者发现一些圆形的金属碎片也可能是些圆柱型的容器上头有些符号还可能有某个考古学家在北美的某个地方发现了大量相似的符号后一夜成名让我们来问问我们自己我们的这些残存给4000年后的人们展示了一个怎样的我们
en:I&#39;d like to begin with a thought experiment.Imagine that it&#39;s 4,000 years into the future.Civilization as we know ithas ceased to exist —no books,no electronic devices,no Facebook or Twitter.All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabethas been lost.Now imagine archeologistsdigging through the rubble of one of our cities.What might they find?Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plasticwith strange symbols on them.Perhaps some circular pieces of metal.Maybe some cylindrical containerswith some symbols on them.And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebritywhen she discovers —buried in the hills somewhere in North America —massive versions of these same symbols.Now let&#39;s ask ourselves,what could such artifacts say about usto people 4,000 years into the future?

zh-cn:这不是假设事实上，这正是我们面对4000年前存在的印度河流域文明时面对的问题古印度河流域文明和较为人所熟知的埃及以及美所不达米亚文化大概处于同时期但其实它的范围超过这两个文明中的任何一个它涵盖了大约一百万平方公里包括今天的巴基斯坦印度的西北部部分阿富汗和伊朗如此广大的文明你可能会期待有强大的统治者，国王以及用来纪念王者的巨大纪念碑事实上考古学者没有发现那些他们发现了这样一些小物件
en:This is no hypothetical question.In fact, this is exactly the kind of question we&#39;re faced withwhen we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization,which existed 4,000 years ago.The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneouswith the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations,but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations.It occupied the areaof approximately one million square kilometers,covering what is now Pakistan,Northwestern Indiaand parts of Afghanistan and Iran.Given that it was such a vast civilization,you might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings,and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings.In fact,what archeologists have found is none of that.They&#39;ve found small objects such as these.

en:Here&#39;s an example of one of these objects.Well obviously this is a replica.But who is this person?A king? A god?A priest?Or perhaps an ordinary personlike you or me?We don&#39;t know.But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them.Well no, not pieces of plastic,but stone seals, copper tablets,pottery and, surprisingly,one large sign board,which was found buried near the gate of a city.Now we don&#39;t know if it says Hollywood,or even Bollywood for that matter.In fact, we don&#39;t even knowwhat any of these objects say,and that&#39;s because the Indus script is undeciphered.We don&#39;t know what any of these symbols mean.

en:The symbols are most commonly found on seals.So you see up there one such object.It&#39;s the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it.Now that&#39;s a magnificent piece of art.So how big do you think that is?Perhaps that big?Or maybe that big?Well let me show you.Here&#39;s a replica of one such seal.It&#39;s only about one inch by one inch in size —pretty tiny.So what were these used for?We know that these were used for stamping clay tagsthat were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other.So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes?These were used to make those kinds of packing slips.You might wonder what these objects containin terms of their text.Perhaps they&#39;re the name of the senderor some information about the goodsthat are being sent from one place to the other — we don&#39;t know.We need to decipher the script to answer that question.

zh-cn:破解这段文字不只是破解一个智力难题事实上这个问题深深地和南亚的政治文化历史交织在一起而对这些文字的争论已经形成了一个战场三群持不同见解团体各持己见第一群人热切地坚信这些印度河流域的字符完全不代表语言这些人认为这些符号和交通标示的符号相似也像盾上面的一些象征符号第二群人相信印度河文字代表着某个印欧语言如果你看看印度今日的版图很多在印度北部使用的语言都是属于印欧语系所以一些人相信古印度河文字是某种古老的印欧语，就像梵语一样
en:Deciphering the scriptis not just an intellectual puzzle;it&#39;s actually become a questionthat&#39;s become deeply intertwinedwith the politics and the cultural history of South Asia.In fact, the script has become a battleground of sortsbetween three different groups of people.First, there&#39;s a group of peoplewho are very passionate in their beliefthat the Indus scriptdoes not represent a language at all.These people believe that the symbolsare very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signsor the emblems you find on shields.There&#39;s a second group of peoplewho believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language.If you look at a map of India today,you&#39;ll see that most of the languages spoken in North Indiabelong to the Indo-European language family.So some people believe that the Indus scriptrepresents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit.

zh-cn:最后一群人相信古印度人是现居南印度的人的祖先这些人觉得古印度文字是达罗毗荼语系下的一种古老的文字形式现今南印度多数人皆使用达罗毗荼语支持这一理论的人指出印度北部有一小部份使用达罗毗荼语的人事实上靠近阿富汗他们说或许，过去曾经有一段时间整个印度都使用达罗毗荼语这也意味着印度河文明或许就是达罗毗荼文明
en:There&#39;s a last group of peoplewho believe that the Indus peoplewere the ancestors of people living in South India today.These people believe that the Indus scriptrepresents an ancient formof the Dravidian language family,which is the language family spoken in much of South India today.And the proponents of this theorypoint to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North,actually near Afghanistan,and they say that perhaps, sometime in the past,Dravidian languages were spoken all over Indiaand that this suggeststhat the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian.

zh-cn:这些假设哪个是真的呢？我们不知道， 但如果你能解开这些文字符号你就能回答这个问题但是破解文字密码是一项很具有挑战性的任务首先， 我们没有罗塞塔石碑我不是指那软件我是指那件文物上面用我们知道和不知道的文字书写了同样的内容。印度河文化中并没有发现同样的古物而且，我们不知道他们说的是什么语言更糟的是大部份的文字都相当短就像我刚才给大家看的，最常发现的是在印章类的东西上他们都非常非常地小
en:Which of these hypotheses can be true?We don&#39;t know, but perhaps if you deciphered the script,you would be able to answer this question.But deciphering the script is a very challenging task.First, there&#39;s no Rosetta Stone.I don&#39;t mean the software;I mean an ancient artifactthat contains in the same textboth a known text and an unknown text.We don&#39;t have such an artifact for the Indus script.And furthermore, we don&#39;t even know what language they spoke.And to make matters even worse,most of the text that we have are extremely short.So as I showed you, they&#39;re usually found on these sealsthat are very, very tiny.

zh-cn:给我们解读带来了难以克服的障碍有些人或许会担心是否真的有谁可以解开古印度河文字之谜呢？在我接下来的演讲中我要来告诉各位我怎么学会停止担心并喜欢上解读古印度河文字所带来的挑战我对古印度河文字的痴迷从在中学课本中读到便开始我为什么会着迷呢？因为这是历史上目前唯一未被破解的重要的古文字我的职业生涯让我成为一个计算机神经科学家我白天的工作是在电脑上模拟大脑试图了借大脑是怎样预知事物的大脑是怎样做决定的，大脑是怎样学习的等等
en:And so given these formidable obstacles,one might wonder and worrywhether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script.In the rest of my talk,I&#39;d like to tell you about how I learned to stop worryingand love the challenge posed by the Indus script.I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the Indus scriptever since I read about it in a middle school textbook.And why was I fascinated?Well it&#39;s the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world.My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist,so in my day job,I create computer models of the brainto try to understand how the brain makes predictions,how the brain makes decisions,how the brain learns and so on.

zh-cn:但在2007年，我与古印度河文字重逢当时在印度我有幸得到机会跟一些印度科学家会面他们在用计算机模型分析这些文字那个时候我认识到这是我跟这些科学家合作的一个机会所以我立刻就抓住了这个机会我想在这里介绍我们发现的一些结果或者更好的是，让我们一起来破解吧你们准备好了吗？
en:But in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script.That&#39;s when I was in India,and I had the wonderful opportunityto meet with some Indian scientistswho were using computer models to try to analyze the script.And so it was then that I realizedthere was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists,and so I jumped at that opportunity.And I&#39;d like to describe some of the results that we have found.Or better yet, let&#39;s all collectively decipher.Are you ready?

zh-cn:当你想要破解文字符号时，首先你要分辨书写的方向这里有两段相同符号的文字你能告诉我书写的方向是从右到左还是从左到右？我给大家几秒钟想一想好， 从右到左，有多少人同意？好从左到右呢？噢，大约是一半一半答案是：如果你看这两段文字的左边你会注意到左边的符号挤在一起好像是4000年前当书写者从右写到左时因为最后没地方了写了只能缩小间距其中有一个符号也出现在下面的文字上面意味着书写的方向是从右到左的所以我们知道的第一件事是书写方向是语言符号中一个很关键的方面因此古印度河文字就有了这个特别的特征
en:The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered scriptis try to figure out the direction of writing.Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them.Can you tell meif the direction of writing is right to left or left to right?I&#39;ll give you a couple of seconds.Okay. Right to left, how many? Okay.Okay. Left to right?Oh, it&#39;s almost 50/50. Okay.The answer is:if you look at the left-hand side of the two texts,you&#39;ll notice that there&#39;s a cramping of signs,and it seems like 4,000 years ago,when the scribe was writing from right to left,they ran out of space.And so they had to cram the sign.One of the signs is also below the text on the top.This suggests the direction of writingwas probably from right to left,and so that&#39;s one of the first things we know,that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts.And the Indus script now hasthis particular property.

zh-cn:这文字符号中还有什么其他语言特征？语言会有一定模式如果我给你一个字母Q然后请你猜下一个字母，你们觉得会是什么呢？大部份人都会说U，那是对的现在我请你们再猜下个字母你们觉得会是什么呢？现在这边有很多种答案，有人说E，可能是I, 也可能是一个A,但是肯定不是B,C,或者D,对吗？印度河文字也有类似的模式有很多段文字的开头都有菱形符号接着常常是跟着一个有点象引号那样的符号这就跟Q跟U的例子很相似这符号之后会有着类似鱼等其他的符号但从来不会是最底下出现的这些符号进一步来说，有些符号常常出现在文章结尾像是这壶型的记号事实上，这记号刚好是在这些文句中最常出现的记号
en:What other properties of language does the script show?Languages contain patterns.If I give you the letter Qand ask you to predict the next letter, what do you think that would be?Most of you said U, which is right.Now if I asked you to predict one more letter,what do you think that would be?Now there&#39;s several thoughts. There&#39;s E. It could be I. It could be A,but certainly not B, C or D, right?The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns.There&#39;s a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol.And this in turn tends to be followedby this quotation marks-like symbol.And this is very similar to a Q and U example.This symbol can in turn be followedby these fish-like symbols and some other signs,but never by these other signs at the bottom.And furthermore, there&#39;s some signsthat really prefer the end of texts,such as this jar-shaped sign,and this sign, in fact, happens to bethe most frequently occurring sign in the script.

zh-cn:看出这些惯用模式后，我们有个想法就是用电脑去了解这些图案我们将这些现存的文字符号输入电脑然后电脑以某种统计模型算出哪些符号会一起出现而哪些符号常以先后顺序出现使用此电脑模式我们可以用考试的方法来测试这个模式我们可以故意去掉某些符号我们让计算机来预测缺少的字符这是一些例子你们可以把这个看作最古老的幸运大转盘游戏（一个填字游戏）
en:Given such patterns, here was our idea.The idea was to use a computerto learn these patterns,and so we gave the computer the existing texts.And the computer learned a statistical modelof which symbols tend to occur togetherand which symbols tend to follow each other.Given the computer model,we can test the model by essentially quizzing it.So we could deliberately erase some symbols,and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols.Here are some examples.You may regard thisas perhaps the most ancient gameof Wheel of Fortune.

zh-cn:我们发现计算机预测正确字符的成功率是75%剩下的例子中正确答案不是在第二选择就是在第三选择中这种预测方法会派到实际的用处很多文字符号都已经损坏这里有个例子我们可以使用电脑模式来修复这段文字内容并做出最好的猜测这就是一个预测的例子这非常有用， 在我们破解字符的过程中让我们得到了更多可供分析的数据
en:What we foundwas that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the casesin predicting the correct symbol.In the rest of the cases,typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer.There&#39;s also practical usefor this particular procedure.There&#39;s a lot of these texts that are damaged.Here&#39;s an example of one such text.And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this textand make a best guess prediction.Here&#39;s an example of a symbol that was predicted.And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the scriptby generating more data that we can analyze.

zh-cn:还有另一件事也是可以利用电脑模式来做的想象有个猴子坐在键盘上我猜会得到一堆像这样随机跑出的字母这些随机混乱的字母说明了很高的熵这是物理学和信息理论的说法但想像这是相当随机混乱的字母排列你们中多少人曾经将咖啡溅在键盘上？你也许会碰到键盘卡住的问题所以同一个字符会一再重复这类的数列可以说有着非常低的熵因为它们一点都没变化语言，从别个角度说，有着中间程度的熵它不是很严格也不是很随机那印度河字符呢？这个图表显示了一大堆顺序的熵值你会在上面发现那些随机顺序那是一些杂乱随机放置的字母有趣的是， 我们同时发现人类基因的DNA排序和乐器演奏的音乐它们都非常非常灵活所以他们处在高程度的范围里在低端范围里你可以发现很严格的顺序， 比如全是字母A的排列你还会发现一个计算机程序是用FORTRAN语言写的它遵循严格的规则语言文字占中间段
en:Now here&#39;s one other thing you can do with the computer model.So imagine a monkeysitting at a keyboard.I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this.Such a random jumble of lettersis said to have a very high entropy.This is a physics and information theory term.But just imagine it&#39;s a really random jumble of letters.How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard?You might have encountered the stuck-key problem —so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again.This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropybecause there&#39;s no variation at all.Language, on the other hand, has an intermediate level of entropy;it&#39;s neither too rigid,nor is it too random.What about the Indus script?Here&#39;s a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences.At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence,which is a random jumble of letters —and interestingly, we also findthe DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music.And both of these are very, very flexible,which is why you find them in the very high range.At the lower end of the scale,you find a rigid sequence, a sequence of all A&#39;s,and you also find a computer program,in this case in the language Fortran,which obeys really strict rules.Linguistic scriptsoccupy the middle range.

zh-cn:那印度河文字呢？我们发现印度河流域的文字的数值正好落在语言文字段里这个结果刚公布的时候引起了很大的争议有人提出强烈反对这些批评的人认为古印度河文字根本不是文字我甚至收到一些恶意信函我的学生说我应该要严肃地考虑怎样保护自身安危谁会想到解读古文字会变成一种危险职业这结果说明了什么呢？说明了古印度河文字有着重要的语言特征所以，就像老话说的那样如果这看起来像是语言性文字且它也有语言性文字的功用恐怕我们手里捧着的大概就是一种语言文字有什么其他证据显示这类文字事实上包涵语言
en:Now what about the Indus script?We found that the Indus scriptactually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.When this result was first published,it was highly controversial.There were people who raised a hue and cry,and these people were the ones who believedthat the Indus script does not represent language.I even started to get some hate mail.My students saidthat I should really seriously consider getting some protection.Who&#39;d have thoughtthat deciphering could be a dangerous profession?What does this result really show?It shows that the Indus scriptshares an important property of language.So, as the old saying goes,if it looks like a linguistic scriptand it acts like a linguistic script,then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands.What other evidence is therethat the script could actually encode language?

zh-cn:语言字符其实可以被包括在多种语言中比如，这是同样一句话写成英语这是这句话写成荷兰语用到同样的字母如果你不懂荷兰语只知道英语我给你看一些荷兰语单词你会说这些词包涵了一些独特的模式有些地方不对你也会说这些不是英文单词这同样也发生在印度河文字中计算机也发现一些文字这里有两三个他们具有很独特的模式比如，第一个例子这个壶形字符被重复这个符号是印度河文字里最常见的一个记号而只在这段文字里它以成对的模式出现
en:Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages.So for example, here&#39;s the same sentence written in Englishand the same sentence written in Dutchusing the same letters of the alphabet.If you don&#39;t know Dutch and you only know Englishand I give you some words in Dutch,you&#39;ll tell me that these words containsome very unusual patterns.Some things are not right,and you&#39;ll say these words are probably not English words.The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script.The computer found several texts —two of them are shown here —that have very unusual patterns.So for example the first text:there&#39;s a doubling of this jar-shaped sign.This sign is the most frequently-occurring signin the Indus script,and it&#39;s only in this textthat it occurs as a doubling pair.

zh-cn:为什么呢？我们回去找这些特殊的文字是在哪里找到的我们发现它们出现在离印度河谷十分遥远的地方它们是在现在的伊朗和伊拉克被发现的它们怎么会出现在那里呢？我还没有告诉你们印度人相当会做生意他们曾跑到离他们居住很远的地方去做交易在这个例子中，他们跨越海洋到了两河流域，也就是今天的伊拉克看起来印度的生意人，商人在用这些文字记录外语就好比英语和荷兰语的例子这可以解释为什么我们会发现这些奇怪的规律它们和在印度河流域发现的文字的规律非常不同这说明印度河文字，同样的文字可能被用来记录不同的语言根据我们现有的研究结果指向的结论来看印度河流域的这些字符代表语言
en:Why is that the case?We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found,and it turns out that they were foundvery, very far away from the Indus Valley.They were found in present day Iraq and Iran.And why were they found there?What I haven&#39;t told you is thatthe Indus people were very, very enterprising.They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived,and so in this case, they were traveling by seaall the way to Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq.And what seems to have happened hereis that the Indus traders, the merchants,were using this script to write a foreign language.It&#39;s just like our English and Dutch example.And that would explain why we have these strange patternsthat are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the textthat are found within the Indus Valley.This suggests that the same script, the Indus script,could be used to write different languages.The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusionthat the Indus script probably does represent language.
时间：13:19
zh-cn:而如果它的确代表语言那么我们怎样来解读这些符号这是对我们最大的挑战你注意到很多这些符号看上去像人和昆虫的图画或者鱼，鸟很多古代的字符都使用了画谜原则也就是用图画代表字词比如， 这是一个词你能用图画来书写吗？我给你们几秒钟画好了吗好这是我的答案你可以用一片树叶(leaf)跟了一只蜜蜂(bee)那就是&quot;相信“(发音跟bee加leaf接近）对吗？也可能有其他的答案对印度河字符来说我们的面临着反向的挑战你得找到每幅图的发声整个排列秩序意义通顺所以这就跟填字游戏一样只不过这是所有填字游戏的鼻祖因为破解它的价值太可观了
en:If it does represent language,then how do we read the symbols?That&#39;s our next big challenge.So you&#39;ll notice that many of the symbolslook like pictures of humans, of insects,of fishes, of birds.Most ancient scriptsuse the rebus principle,which is, using pictures to represent words.So as an example, here&#39;s a word.Can you write it using pictures?I&#39;ll give you a couple seconds.Got it?Okay. Great.Here&#39;s my solution.You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf —and that&#39;s &quot;belief,&quot; right.There could be other solutions.In the case of the Indus script,the problem is the reverse.You have to figure out the sounds of each of these picturessuch that the entire sequence makes sense.So this is just like a crossword puzzle,except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzlesbecause the stakes are so high if you solve it.
时间：14:17
zh-cn:我的同事， Iravatham Mahadevan 和 Asko Parpola已经在这个特殊的问题上取得了一定的进展我给你你们看一个Parpola研究的例子这是一段很短的文字它里面有7个竖笔，跟了一个象鱼的形状我得提一下这些章用于印在黏土标签上然后附在一捆捆的货物上所以这些标签，至少其中的一些有商品的名字而在印度这是一个久远的传统名字是根据星座和生日的时候展示的星宿来定的在达罗毗荼语系中鱼的发音是“meen”而这个字的发音跟星星刚好相同所以七颗星星代表“elu meen”就是达罗毗荼语的北斗七星同样地，这里有六颗星可以听作“aru meen”是一个达罗毗荼语的旧名词代表昴宿星团最后， 还有其他的组合比如鱼的符号上有个顶可以说成“MEY meen”在旧达罗毗荼语中指土星让人感到振奋的是我们似乎有所进展
en:My colleagues, Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola,have been making some headway on this particular problem.And I&#39;d like to give you a quick example of Parpola&#39;s work.Here&#39;s a really short text.It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign.And I want to mention that these seals were usedfor stamping clay tagsthat were attached to bundles of goods,so it&#39;s quite likely that these tags, at least some of them,contain names of merchants.And it turns out that in Indiathere&#39;s a long traditionof names being based on horoscopesand star constellations present at the time of birth.In Dravidian languages,the word for fish is &quot;meen&quot;which happens to sound just like the word for star.And so seven starswould stand for &quot;elu meen,&quot;which is the Dravidian wordfor the Big Dipper star constellation.Similarly, there&#39;s another sequence of six stars,and that translates to &quot;aru meen,&quot;which is the old Dravidian namefor the star constellation Pleiades.And finally, there&#39;s other combinations,such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it.And that could be translated into &quot;mey meen,&quot;which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn.So that was pretty exciting.It looks like we&#39;re getting somewhere.

zh-cn:但这样是否就能证明这些印章上达罗毗荼语的名字是基于星球和星座呢？还不能我们没有办法验证这些解读方式是正确的但是如果越来越多的解读开始有道理而越来越长的排序显示出正确性那我们就知道我们走上了正道今天我们可以用埃及象形文字以及楔形文字写下的TED这样的名字因为人们在十九世纪就破解了这两种文字符号这两种文字的破解使得这些古文明能与我们再次直接的交流玛雅文明也在20世纪开始与我们对话而印度河流域的文明至今保持沉默
en:But does this provethat these seals contain Dravidian namesbased on planets and star constellations?Well not yet.So we have no way of validatingthese particular readings,but if more and more of these readings start making sense,and if longer and longer sequencesappear to be correct,then we know that we are on the right track.Today,we can write a word such as TEDin Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script,because both of these were decipheredin the 19th century.The decipherment of these two scriptsenabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly.The Mayansstarted speaking to us in the 20th century,but the Indus civilization remains silent.

zh-cn:我们为什么在乎呢？印度河流域的文化不仅仅属于南印度或者是北印度或者是巴基斯坦它是属于我们大家的他们是我们的祖先你们的也是我们的因为在历史发展中不幸偶然地沉寂了如果我们破解了这些字符我们可以让他们再一次和我们交流他们会告诉我们什么呢？我们会在他们身上和我们自己身上发现什么呢？我迫不及待地想要找到答案
en:Why should we care?The Indus civilization does not belongto just the South Indians or the North Indiansor the Pakistanis;it belongs to all of us.These are our ancestors —yours and mine.They were silencedby an unfortunate accident of history.If we decipher the script,we would enable them to speak to us again.What would they tell us?What would we find out about them?
