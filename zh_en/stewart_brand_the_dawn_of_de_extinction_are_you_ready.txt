zh-cn:目前，灭种是另一种形式的死亡规模甚至更大而我们人类直到1914年当最后一只名为玛莎的母北美候鸽死于辛辛那提动物园时 我们才惊觉这点牠们曾是世上数量最多的鸟类在北美洲存活了六百万年突然间就这么消逝了牠们曾是一英里宽，四百英里长的群体还能够遮蔽太阳奥尔多•利奥波德说过：“这是一场生物风暴”“一场羽毛风暴”而牠们的确是关键物种使整个东部的落叶林更加丰盛从密西西比河到大西洋从加拿大往下至墨西哥湾但就在短短数十年间 数量便从五十亿骤降至零发生了什么？
en:Now, extinction is a different kind of death.It&#39;s bigger.We didn&#39;t really realize that until 1914,when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha,died at the Cincinnati zoo.This had been the most abundant bird in the worldthat&#39;d been in North America for six million years.Suddenly it wasn&#39;t here at all.Flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles longused to darken the sun.Aldo Leopold said this was a biological storm,a feathered tempest.And indeed it was a keystone speciesthat enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest,from the Mississippi to the Atlantic,from Canada down to the Gulf.But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades.What happened?

zh-cn:嗯，是因为商业狩猎的开始牠们被捕捉 身上的肉数以吨计地被贩售这并不困难，因为当牠们一大群飞降地面时会十分稠密地聚在一起上百位猎人及网子此时一出动就扑杀成千上百的旅鸽牠们曾是美洲最便宜的蛋白质来源在上个世纪结束时，牠们已经一无所剩除了牠们美丽的皮羽还保存在博物馆标本抽屉里
en:Well, commercial hunting happened.These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton,and it was easy to do because when those big flockscame down to the ground, they were so densethat hundreds of hunters and netters could show upand slaughter them by the tens of thousands.It was the cheapest source of protein in America.By the end of the century, there was nothing leftbut these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers.

zh-cn:故事还有积极的另一面它让人们了解同样一件事情即将发生在美洲水牛身上这样，这些鸟倒是救了水牛一命
en:There&#39;s an upside to the story.This made people realize that the same thingwas about to happen to the American bison,and so these birds saved the buffalos.

zh-cn:但是，很多其他动物并未被保留下来卡罗来纳鹦鹉是是一种曾点缀了家家户户后院的鹦鹉。因为牠自身华美的羽毛而被猎捕致死有一种东海岸的鸟，人们喜欢称为松鸡外表十分惹人怜爱人们尝试着去保护他们，然而牠还是绝迹了一家当地报纸阐明着，牠们一只不剩世界再也没办法创造出这样的生命。当物种消失时，总是有种深沉的哀伤蔓延许多受人喜爱的鸟类已遭此命运同样状况也发生在许多哺乳动物身上另一个关键物种是种有名的动物欧洲野牛最近还有部关于牠们的电影这些野牛很像水牛基本上，这种动物的生态功能使得欧亚大陆的森林之间保有草原从西班牙一直延伸到韩国而人类关于这种动物的记载可以回溯到拉斯科岩洞画的年代
en:But a lot of other animals weren&#39;t saved.The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere.It was hunted to death for its feathers.There was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen.It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway.A local newspaper spelled out, &quot;There is no survivor,there is no future, there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again.&quot;There&#39;s a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things,and it happened to lots of birds that people loved.It happened to lots of mammals.Another keystone species is a famous animalcalled the European aurochs.There was sort of a movie made about it recently.And the aurochs was like the bison.This was an animal that basically kept the forestmixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent,from Spain to Korea.The documentation of this animal goes backto the Lascaux cave paintings.

zh-cn:许多动物仍陆续灭绝一种分布在西班牙，名为布卡多山羊的野山羊于2000年灭绝也有一些令人惊叹的物种，像是袋狼他们在澳洲的塔斯马尼亚州又称塔斯马尼亚狼或塔斯马尼亚虎他们也逃不过猎杀，最后几只在动物园中死去这是一小段影片
en:The extinctions still go on.There&#39;s an ibex in Spain called the bucardo.It went extinct in 2000.There was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolfcalled the thylacine in Tasmania, south of Australia,called the Tasmanian tiger.It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos.A little bit of film was shot.
时间： 3:14
zh-cn:沉重、愤怒、悲伤但别悲伤，振作起来如果你发现利用博物馆标本或是20万年前化石中的DNA可以让这些物种复活你会怎么做呢？你又会从何做起？
en:Sorrow, anger, mourning.Don&#39;t mourn. Organize.What if you could find out that, using the DNA in museum specimens,fossils maybe up to 200,000 years oldcould be used to bring species back,what would you do? Where would you start?
时间： 3:33
zh-cn:你可能会先确定，生物技术是否达得到要求我则是从我太太莱恩·费伦娜开始她经营一家叫DNA direct的生技公司透过她，我认识了她的同事乔治.邱奇他也是位着迷于旅鸽的顶尖基因工程师他对他所使用的方法深具信心他对他所使用的方法深居信心并认为他可以让物种复活
en:Well, you&#39;d start by finding out if the biotech is really there.I started with my wife, Ryan Phelan,who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct,and through her, one of her colleagues, George Church,one of the leading genetic engineerswho turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeonsand a lot of confidencethat methodologies he was working onmight actually do the deed.
时间： 3:57
zh-cn:所以他和莱恩策划并主持了一个会议在哈佛的维斯学院召集了一批旅鸽专家、鸟类保育学家、生物伦理学家而且很幸运的是旅鸽的DNA已经被一名叫做贝丝．夏皮罗的分子生物学家完成定序而她只用了保存在史密森纳研究院标本中的一小块脚部组织因为里面含有原始DNADNA已经碎裂成片段利用现在的技术，你可以重组完整的基因序列
en:So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meetingat the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing togetherspecialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists,and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequencedby a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro.All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonianwas a little bit of toe pad tissue,because down in there is what is called ancient DNA.It&#39;s DNA which is pretty badly fragmented,but with good techniques now, you can basically reassemble the whole genome.
时间： 4:31
zh-cn:问题在于你能不能利用基因体重新“组合”出健全的鸟？乔治·邱奇认为这可以达到在他写的、也是我强力推荐的《重生》中有一章节解释了复活灭绝物种的技术这个仪器被他称为：多样化自动基因体建构机这项技术和演化的机制类似你将不同组合的基因送入细胞从细胞层级到组织层级再把成功存活下来的组织送入代理孕母体内，它就会成功从乔治难以辨识的记录中我们可以知道这项技术的精确度达到碱基对的层级后鸽基因体包含13亿对碱基
en:Then the question is, can you reassemble,with that genome, the whole bird?George Church thinks you can.So in his book, &quot;Regenesis,&quot; which I recommend,he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species,and he has a machine calledthe Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine.It&#39;s kind of like an evolution machine.You try combinations of genes that you writeat the cell level and then in organs on a chip,and the ones that win, that you can then putinto a living organism. It&#39;ll work.The precision of this, one of George&#39;s famous unreadable slides,nevertheless points out that there&#39;s a level of precision hereright down to the individual base pair.The passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome.
时间： 5:17
zh-cn:所以你现在能做的是把一个基因用它的对偶基因取代（译注：这是用来解决原始基因序列上破裂、缺失的问题）这在正常的精卵结合过程中也会发生所以，我们可用和灭绝物种最接近的物种组合并修复灭绝物种的基因体在此过程中，乔治指出他所使用的合成生物学技术现在成长速度是莫尔定律的四倍这从2005开始，也很有可能一直延续下去
en:So what you&#39;re getting is the capability nowof replacing one gene with another variation of that gene.It&#39;s called an allele.Well that&#39;s what happens in normal hybridization anyway.So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genomeof an extinct specieswith the genome of its closest living relative.Now along the way, George points out thathis technology, the technology of synthetic biology,is currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore&#39;s Law.It&#39;s been doing that since 2005, and it&#39;s likely to continue.
时间： 5:52
zh-cn:最接近旅鸽的存活物种是带尾鸽牠们数量庞大，在这附近也有从基因层面来说，带尾鸽似乎是活着的旅鸽牠们的基因体中只有一些带尾鸽特有的序列牠们的基因体中只有一些带尾鸽特有的序列如果你将这些序列以旅鸽特有的序列取代你就有一只已经灭绝的旅鸽对你咕咕叫
en:Okay, the closest living relative of the passenger pigeonis the band-tailed pigeon. They&#39;re abundant. There&#39;s some around here.Genetically, the band-tailed pigeon already ismostly living passenger pigeon.There&#39;s just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon.If you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits,you&#39;ve got the extinct bird back, cooing at you.
时间： 6:13
zh-cn:现在需要着手进行的是：你必须分辨出那些基因是重要的像是带尾鸽拥有短尾的基因而旅鸽则是表现长尾的基因还有红颜、桃红色的胸部和群集行为等基因将这些都加在一起，结果不会是完美的但应该就近乎完美了自然界中也没有完美的作品
en:Now, there&#39;s work to do.You have to figure out exactly what genes matter.So there&#39;s genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon,genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon,and so on with the red eye, peach-colored breast, flocking, and so on.Add them all up and the result won&#39;t be perfect.But it should be be perfect enough,because nature doesn&#39;t do perfect either.
时间： 6:34
zh-cn:所以，在波士顿的会议中决定了三件事
en:So this meeting in Boston led to three things.
时间： 6:39
zh-cn:首先，我和莱恩创立了个非盈利组织这个名为“复活与保存”的组织致力于以负责任的方式推动“反灭绝”而我们将先从旅鸽做起
en:First off, Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofitcalled Revive and Restore that would push de-extinction generallyand try to have it go in a responsible way,and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon.
时间： 6:52
zh-cn:另一项结果是本·诺瓦克，一位年轻研究生他从14岁起就为旅鸽所深深着迷而且在学会如何操作原始DNA后他利用家人和朋友的帮助完成了旅鸽基因体定序我们雇佣了他这是一张在去年在史密森纳我帮他照的照片照片中他低头看着玛莎世界上最后一只旅鸽如果他成功的话，它就不会是最后一只
en:Another direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak,who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA,himself sequenced the passenger pigeon,using money from his family and friends.We hired him full-time.Now, this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian,he&#39;s looking down at Martha,the last passenger pigeon alive.So if he&#39;s successful, she won&#39;t be the last.
时间： 7:22
zh-cn:波士顿会议的第三项结果是让我们了解到世界上有许多科学家在进行不同形式的反灭绝但他们素未谋面而国家地理频道对此很感兴趣因为他们有个想法就是上世纪的发现是为了寻找未知而这个世纪是在创造发明而灭绝符合此条件所以他们资助并主办了这场会议让35位保育生物学家和分子生物学家见面并讨论合作机会其中一些保育生物学家非常激进其中三人不只要让古生物复活他们更希望在北西伯利亚、荷兰和夏威夷恢复已经消失的生态系统
en:The third result of the Boston meeting was the realizationthat there are scientists all over the worldworking on various forms of de-extinction,but they&#39;d never met each other.And National Geographic got interestedbecause National Geographic has the theory thatthe last century, discovery was basically finding things,and in this century, discovery is basically making things.De-extinction falls in that category.So they hosted and funded this meeting. And 35 scientists,they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists,basically meeting to see if they had work to do together.Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical.There&#39;s three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species,they&#39;re recreating extinct ecosystemsin northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii.
时间： 8:08
zh-cn:来自荷兰的亨利嗯，我不大会说他的荷兰姓氏在做欧洲野牛欧洲野牛是所有被驯养牛种的祖先所以牠的基因体还存在，只是不平均的散布在不同品种里所以他们利用七个原始、强韧和上图原牛相似的品种利用筛选性的繁殖希望可以让欧洲野牛重现现在野放在韩国推展的比美国更为迅速所以我们计划将野牛引进欧洲的野放区让他们扮演原有的生态功能他们原本在生态系统中扮演的角色让原本茂密森林下的贫瘠土壤重现多样化的草原植被
en:Henri, from the Netherlands,with a Dutch last name I won&#39;t try to pronounce,is working on the aurochs.The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle,and so basically its genome is alive, it&#39;s just unevenly distributed.So what they&#39;re doing is working with seven breedsof primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top thereto rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding,the aurochs.Now, re-wilding is moving faster in Koreathan it is in America,and so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe,they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job,its old ecological role,of clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forestso that it has these biodiverse meadows in it.

zh-cn:另一个令人惊叹的故事是来自阿贝图.费尔南斯.阿里阿贝图在西班牙研究布卡多山羊最后一只是名叫西丽亚的母羊当研究员捕捉它时它还健在当时他们从他耳朵取得一小块组织并冷冻保存于液态氮中后将他野放但数个月后发现他被树木压死他们利用他耳朵中的DNA恢复成受精卵的形式并植入山羊当孕期结束活生生的布卡多山羊就出生了这是历史上第一个反灭绝的实例
en:Another amazing storycame from Alberto Fernández-Arias.Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain.The last bucardo was a female named Celiawho was still alive, but then they captured her,they got a little bit of tissue from her ear,they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen,released her back into the wild,but a few months later, she was found dead under a fallen tree.They took the DNA from that ear,they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat,the pregnancy came to term,and a live baby bucardo was born.It was the first de-extinction in history.

zh-cn:但牠活的不久有时跨种的复制会造成生物呼吸系统的问题这只肺脏发育不全的羊只存活了10 分钟但阿贝图对深具信心因为动物复制技术已有长足进步未来终究会更加发达他相信未来会有成群的布卡多山羊重返西班牙北部的山区
en:It was short-lived.Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems.This one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes,but Alberto was confident thatcloning has moved along well since then,and this will move ahead, and eventuallythere will be a population of bucardosback in the mountains in northern Spain.

zh-cn:冷冻保存的先驱奥利弗·雷德在圣地亚哥动物园中他的冰冻园区在过去35年内搜集了超过1千种物种的组织当冰封在低温——-196摄氏度细胞和其中的DNA都可以完整保存它们基本上都是能培养的细胞先进细胞科技公司的鲍勃·兰扎从濒临绝种的爪哇野牛的冷冻组织中取了一些植入母乳牛当母牛孕期届满一只健康的爪哇野牛宝宝就诞生了牠仍健在，也在持续成长中
en:Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder.At the San Diego zoo, his frozen zoohas collected the tissues from over 1,000 speciesover the last 35 years.Now, when it&#39;s frozen that deep,minus 196 degrees Celsius,the cells are intact and the DNA is intact.They&#39;re basically viable cells,so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technologytook some of that tissue from an endangered animalcalled the Javan banteng, put it in a cow,the cow went to term, and what was bornwas a live, healthy baby Javan banteng,who thrived and is still alive.
时间：10:46
zh-cn:最让鲍勃兴奋的是现在可以将任何细胞诱导成全能干细胞并将其分化成如精子、卵子这类生殖细胞的技术
en:The most exciting thing for Bob Lanzais the ability now to take any kind of cellwith induced pluripotent stem cellsand turn it into germ cells, like sperm and eggs.
时间：10:57
zh-cn:现在我们来介绍麦克·麦格罗他是一位在苏格兰罗斯林研究所的科学家麦克在鸟类上展现奇迹他会拿猎鹰的皮肤细胞，例如纤维母细胞让它恢复成全能干细胞因为它具有全能性，所以也可以分化成种质然后他有种方法可以将种质送入鸡蛋的胚胎中所以这只鸡将会长出猎鹰的生殖腺当你把他们凑成对后就可以生出猎鹰了（笑声）从改造的鸡生出猎鹰
en:So now we go to Mike McGrewwho is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland,and Mike&#39;s doing miracles with birds.So he&#39;ll take, say, falcon skin cells, fibroblast,turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells.Since it&#39;s so pluripotent, it can become germ plasm.He then has a way to put the germ plasminto the embryo of a chicken eggso that that chicken will have, basically,the gonads of a falcon.You get a male and a female each of those,and out of them comes falcons.(Laughter)Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens.
时间：11:38
zh-cn:本·诺瓦克是会议中最年轻的科学家他展示了如何让这些技术衔接在一起流程如下：他会先利用带尾鸽和旅鸽的基因体放在一起再利用乔治·邱奇的技术修复旅鸽的DNA罗伯特·兰扎和麦克·麦格罗的技术则可以将DNA送入鸡的生殖腺并生出旅鸽蛋、孵化成雏鸽你就可以得到旅鸽族群
en:Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting.He showed how all of this can be put together.The sequence of events: he&#39;ll put together the genomesof the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon,he&#39;ll take the techniques of George Churchand get passenger pigeon DNA,the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew,get that DNA into chicken gonads,and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs, squabs,and now you&#39;re getting a population of passenger pigeons.
时间：12:06
zh-cn:这可能会有个问题：没有旅鸽亲鸟如何教导乳鸽成为一只真正的旅鸽你会怎么解决这个问题？还好大部分鸟类行为都包含在他们的DNA里单位了保险起见，他提出一个想法：利用信鸽教导年轻的旅鸽如何结队飞行并且找到原本筑巢、育幼的地方
en:It does raise the question of,they&#39;re not going to have passenger pigeon parentsto teach them how to be a passenger pigeon.So what do you do about that?Well birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens,so most of that is already in their DNA,but to supplement it, part of Ben&#39;s ideais to use homing pigeonsto help train the young passenger pigeons how to flockand how to find their way to their old nesting groundsand feeding grounds.
时间：12:33
zh-cn:有一些保育学家包含创立保育生物学的著名科学家史坦利·邓波和IUCN负责编纂红名单的凯特·琼斯 (IUCN:国际自然保护联盟)他们对此都非常振奋但他们也担心这会和保护还存活的濒临灭绝动物但他们也担心这会和保护还存活的濒临灭绝动物这项重要工作竞争资源这项重要工作竞争资源你必须保护还存活着的动物为了避免每年2.5万头被猎杀的大象你必须停止亚洲的象牙交易
en:There were some conservationists,really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple,who is one of the founders of conservation biology,and Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List.They&#39;re excited about all this,but they&#39;re also concerned that it might be competitivewith the extremely important efforts to protectendangered species that are still alive,that haven&#39;t gone extinct yet.You see, you want to work on protecting the animals out there.You want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia downso you&#39;re not using 25,000 elephants a year.
时间：13:07
zh-cn:但同时保育生物学家也发现坏消息使人丧气所以即使负责追踪危险和濒临灭绝动物的红名单很重要所以即使负责追踪危险和濒临灭绝动物的红名单很重要但是他们也准备编纂绿名单而绿名单会告诉你哪些物种现在过得很好曾经濒临绝种的白头鹰因为大家的努力，现在他们的状况已经转好而各地的保育区也都经营完善所以他们现在也试着散布好消息而让灭种生物复活就是一个你会想得到的好消息
en:But at the same time, conservation biologists are realizingthat bad news bums people out.And so the Red List is really important, keep track ofwhat&#39;s endangered and critically endangered, and so on.But they&#39;re about to create what they call a Green List,and the Green List will have species that are doing fine, thank you,species that were endangered, like the bald eagle,but they&#39;re much better off now, thanks to everybody&#39;s good work,and protected areas around the worldthat are very, very well managed.So basically, they&#39;re learning how to build on good news.And they see reviving extinct speciesas the kind of good news you might be able to build on.
时间：13:46
zh-cn:这里有几个相关的例子人工繁殖培育是复育生物的重要环节加州神鹫在 1987 年仅剩 22 只大家都觉得他们要消失了因为圣地亚哥动物园的人工繁殖培育现在已有405只，其中226只已经野放这项技术会被用在反灭绝复育的物种另外一个成功的故事是中非的巨猩在1981年黛安·弗里确信他们要灭绝了他们仅剩254只现在已经有880只并且逐年上升3%秘诀就在于他们推动生态旅游计划这招很聪明这张照片是上个月莱恩用iphone拍的野生巨猩在游客前面显得多么自在
en:Here&#39;s a couple related examples.Captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species.The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987.Everybody thought is was finished.Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo,there&#39;s 405 of them now, 226 are out in the wild.That technology will be used on de-extincted animals.Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa.In 1981, Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct.There were just 254 left.Now there are 880. They&#39;re increasing in populationby three percent a year.The secret is, they have an eco-tourism program,which is absolutely brilliant.So this photograph was taken last month by Ryanwith an iPhone.That&#39;s how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors.
时间：14:38
zh-cn:另外一个需要我们帮助的计划是关于北白犀牛他们已经没有能生育的配对了但是这种动物 多样化的DNA保存于冷冻园区只要做个复制，你就能把他们救回来
en:Another interesting project, though it&#39;s going to need some help,is the northern white rhinoceros.There&#39;s no breeding pairs left.But this is the kind of thing thata wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo.A bit of cloning, you can get them back.
时间：14:55
zh-cn:所以我们未来的方向是什么？过去一直都是私人集会我觉得应该让大众了解到这个议题大家会怎么想呢？你们会想要让就回灭绝动物吗？你们会吗？
en:So where do we go from here?These have been private meetings so far.I think it&#39;s time for the subject to go public.What do people think about it?You know, do you want extinct species back?Do you want extinct species back?

zh-cn:我们会先从旅鸽着手就在此时，本·诺瓦克已和加大圣克鲁分校的贝丝·夏皮罗合作他们正在进行旅鸽和带尾鸽基因体的研究当研究结果成熟时，他们会交给乔治·邱奇让他展现魔法还原旅鸽DNA再藉由鲍勃·兰扎和麦克·麦格罗的帮助将种质放进机体内让他们生下小旅鸽再让带尾鸽将他们抚养长大继续这样下去，旅鸽就可以自行繁衍或许他们可在天空翱翔下个60万年当成本降低时可以对卡罗莱纳长尾鹦鹉、大海确、北美松鸡、象牙喙啄木鸟、爱斯基摩杓鹬、加勒比僧海豹、和长毛象进行相同的复活程序
en:We&#39;re also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon.So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the groupthat Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz.They&#39;re going to work on the genomesof the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon.As that data matures, they&#39;ll send it to George Church,who will work his magic, get passenger pigeon DNA out of that.We&#39;ll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrewto get that into germ plasm that can go into chickensthat can produce passenger pigeon squabsthat can be raised by band-tailed pigeon parents,and then from then on, it&#39;s passenger pigeons all the way,maybe for the next six million years.You can do the same thing, as the costs come down,for the Carolina parakeet, for the great auk,for the heath hen, for the ivory-billed woodpecker,for the Eskimo curlew, for the Caribbean monk seal,for the woolly mammoth.
时间：16:12
zh-cn:事实如此：在过去的一万年人类让自然遭受了巨大的创伤而今我们有能力或许也有义务去修复这些损害我们大部分通过扩展保育原生地以及扩大并保护濒临绝种的物种族群 来达成任务但对某些物种而言我们已经将他们赶尽杀绝了我们可以试着让他们复活回到想念他们的世界
en:Because the fact is, humans have made a huge holein nature in the last 10,000 years.We have the ability now,and maybe the moral obligation, to repair some of the damage.Most of that we&#39;ll do by expanding and protecting wildlands,by expanding and protectingthe populations of endangered species.But some speciesthat we killed off totallywe could consider bringing backto a world that misses them.

en:Stewart Brand: Well, the earlier point iswe interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct,and many of them were keystone species,and we changed the whole ecosystem they were inby letting them go.Now, there&#39;s the shifting baseline problem, which is,so when these things come back,they might replace some birds that are therethat people really know and love.I think that&#39;s, you know, part of how it&#39;ll work.This is a long, slow process —One of the things I like about it, it&#39;s multi-generation.We will get woolly mammoths back.
