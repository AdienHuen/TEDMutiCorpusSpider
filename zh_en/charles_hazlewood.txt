zh-cn:我是个指挥家今天我要谈的是信任问题这对我的工作很重要我和乐队间必须有信任建立在互相尊重基础上的牢不可破的信任我们坚信这是我们一起音乐创作的基石
en:I am a conductor,and I&#39;m here todayto talk to you about trust.My job depends upon it.There has to be, between me and the orchestra,an unshakable bond of trust,born out of mutual respect,through which we can spin a musical narrativethat we all believe in.

zh-cn:以前，指挥，谱曲跟信任没有太大关系，而是强迫性的大概是二战期间指挥家总是独裁者这些独裁者们不仅彩排乐队也控制了所有成员，和他们的生活点滴但我很高兴今天是世界已经不同了音乐也是如此如今我们创作音乐的视角和方法更加民主是双向通道作为指挥家的我要在彩排之前就对曲子的大体结构一清二楚在此架构内乐团的成员可以自由地注入他们自己的理解
en:Now in the old days, conducting, music making,was less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion.Up to and around about the Second World War,conductors were invariably dictators —these tyrannical figureswho would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it,within an inch of their lives.But I&#39;m happy to say now that the world has moved on,music has moved on with it.We now have a more democratic view and way of making music —a two-way street.I, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron senseof the outer architecture of that music,within which there is then immense personal freedomfor the members of the orchestra to shine.

zh-cn:对我自己而言我必须完全坚信我的肢体语言因为这是我所有的卖点了无声的语言演奏的时候我很少喊指示
en:For myself, of course,I have to completely trust my body language.That&#39;s all I have at the point of sale.It&#39;s silent gesture.I can hardly bark out instructions while we&#39;re playing.

zh-cn:为了一切顺利我必须心怀信任必须信任乐队更关键的我必须信任自己试想一下：如果你处在没有信任的状况下会怎么做？你会过犹不及在我的游戏里就是太多地指手画脚就像疯狂转动的风车一样你的动作越大对乐队来说反而越不明白越模糊简单说就是毫无是处你就是个搞笑的角色。没有信任只有荒诞
en:So in order for all this to work,obviously I have got to be in a position of trust.I have to trust the orchestra,and, even more crucially, I have to trust myself.Think about it: when you&#39;re in a position of not trusting,what do you do?You overcompensate.And in my game, that means you overgesticulate.You end up like some kind of rabid windmill.And the bigger your gesture gets,the more ill-defined, blurryand, frankly, useless it is to the orchestra.You become a figure of fun. There&#39;s no trust anymore, only ridicule.

zh-cn:我记得事业初期在一次又一次跟乐队成员的出演中我在指挥台上几欲抓狂我只是想要一个小高潮只是音量的稍稍提高他们就是不给面子那些年里我常常独坐在更衣室里静静啜泣英国大牌指挥家科林･戴维斯爵士给我的建议仿佛一点用都没有他说：“查尔斯，指挥家就像手握一只小鸟握太紧，会捏死它握太松，鸟就飞了。”不得不说那时候我还没找到这只鸟
en:And I remember at the beginning of my career,again and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras,I would be going completely insane on the podium,trying to engender a small scale crescendo really,just a little upsurge in volume.Bugger me, they wouldn&#39;t give it to me.I spent a lot of time in those early yearsweeping silently in dressing rooms.And how futile seemed the words of advice to mefrom great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Daviswho said, &quot;Conducting, Charles,is like holding a small bird in your hand.If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.If you hold it too loosely, it flies away.&quot;I have to say, in those days, I couldn&#39;t really even find the bird.

zh-cn:对我来说一个至关重要触及内心的音乐经历是在南非在我看来南非是世界上在音乐上最惊人的国家这个国家通过其音乐文化给我上了重要一课就是通过音乐创作可以触及到能够赋予生命的信任2000年我去南非创立一个歌剧公司我去试镜招人在全国城乡地区招募从2000个歌手里我挑选了最惊为天人的40个组成了公司大部分人都是黑人有一些白人
en:Now a fundamentaland really viscerally important experience for me, in terms of music,has been my adventures in South Africa,the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view,but a country which, through its musical culture,has taught me one fundamental lesson:that through music makingcan come deep levelsof fundamental life-giving trust.Back in 2000, I had the opportunity to go to South Africato form a new opera company.So I went out there, and I auditioned,mainly in rural township locations, right around the country.I heard about 2,000 singersand pulled together a companyof 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers,the majority of whom were black,but there were a handful of white performers.

zh-cn:从第一场彩排就出现了问题一个白人曾经是南非一名警察以前的时候他常常去镇上骚扰居民你可以想像这会让屋子里气氛如何让我们实际一点在南非，最缺乏信任的关系就是一个白人警察和黑人社区间的关系诸位，怎样解决这个问题？很简单，歌唱我们唱啊唱一直唱信任开始建立起来友谊之花盛开这告诉我们一个重要事实音乐创作还有其他形式的创作可以抵达语言力所不及的地方
en:Now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal periodthat one of those white performershad, in his previous incarnation,been a member of the South African police force.And in the last years of the old regime,he would routinely be detailed to go into the townshipto aggress the community.Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room,the general atmosphere.Let&#39;s be under no illusions.In South Africa, the relationship most devoid of trustis that between a white policemanand the black community.So how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen?Simply through singing.We sang, we sang,we sang,and amazingly new trust grew,and indeed friendship blossomed.And that showed me such a fundamental truth,that music making and other forms of creativitycan so often go to placeswhere mere words cannot.

zh-cn:我们开始展露头角 去世界各地演出其中一个就是“卡门”我们接着用“卡门”拍了一部电影在开普敦城外一个叫卡雅利沙的镇上我们录制了这部电影全部都是由科萨语演唱如果你懂这个语言的话会明白这是个美丽的音乐语言这个电影叫&quot;U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha&quot;就是“卡雅利沙的卡门”我给各位演奏一小段只是想向您展示南非的音乐创作是非常伟大的
en:So we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally.One of them was &quot;Carmen.&quot;We then thought we&#39;d make a movie of &quot;Carmen,&quot;which we recorded and shot outside on locationin the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha.The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa,which is a beautifully musical language, if you don&#39;t know it.It&#39;s called &quot;U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha&quot; —literally &quot;Carmen of Khayelitsha.&quot;I want to play you a tiny clip of it nowfor no other reason than to give you proof positivethat there is nothing tiny about South African music making.

zh-cn:我感受到了南非音乐创作中迷人的是其自由性南非人自由地创造音乐我认为主要是由于一个重要事实：他们不受谱号的约束他们从不读音乐他们相信自己的耳朵你只教一个南非人5秒的调子然后奇迹般地他们就能依此即兴创作出和谐的曲子因为他们有这个能力如果生活在西方的我们中的音乐人我们有种迂腐守旧的对音乐的态度－就是音乐全是跟技巧和系统相关所以我们的音乐都是保守的天才和精英但是，各位，也许世界上每一个人每天都会接触到音乐
en:Something which I find utterly enchantingabout South African music makingis that it&#39;s so free.South Africans just make music really freely.And I think, in no small way,that&#39;s due to one fundamental fact:they&#39;re not bound to a system of notation.They don&#39;t read music.They trust their ears.You can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat.And then, as if by magic,they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tunebecause they can.Now those of us that live in the West, if I can use that term,I think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music —that somehow it&#39;s all about skill and systems.Therefore it&#39;s the exclusive preserveof an elite, talented body.And yet, ladies and gentlemen, every single one of us on this planetprobably engages with music on a daily basis.

en:And if I can broaden this out for a second,I&#39;m willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this roomwould be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence,about movies, probably about literature.But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertionabout a piece of classical music?Why is this?And what I&#39;m going to say to you nowis I&#39;m just urging you to get overthis supreme lack of self-confidence,to take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears,you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue,fiber, DNA,what makes a great piece of music great.I&#39;ve got a little experiment I want to try with you.

en:Did you knowthat TED is a tune?A very simple tune based on three notes — T, E, D.Now hang on a minute.I know you&#39;re going to say to me, &quot;T doesn&#39;t exist in music.&quot;Well ladies and gentlemen, there&#39;s a time-honored system,which composers have been using for hundreds of years,which proves actually that it does.If I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G —and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale:H, I, J, K, L, M, N,O, P, Q, R, S, T — there you go.T, see it&#39;s the same as F in music.So T is F.So T, E, D is the same as F, E, D.Now that piece of music that we played at the start of this sessionhad enshrined in its heartthe theme, which is TED.Have a listen.

zh-cn:有个我发起的项目我很想跟诸位分享因为它能让我们抛弃成见建立新层次的信任我最小的孩子生下来是脑瘫你可以想像如果自己没有亲身经历过很难接受这样的事实但是我美好的小女儿带给我的礼物不仅是她的存在更是重要的是我由此开始接触一个迄今为止都不了解的群体残疾人群体当我观看残奥会想着科技已经证明残疾不再是高水平体育成就的障碍当然这个事实有着惨淡的另一面就是世界用了数十年才认识到这个事实的积极一面相信残疾和体育可以以强大说服力和有趣的方式并存
en:Now there&#39;s a project that I&#39;m initiating at the momentthat I&#39;m very excited about and wanted to share with you,because it is all about changing perceptions,and, indeed, building a new level of trust.The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy,which as you can imagine,if you don&#39;t have an experience of it yourself,is quite a big thing to take on board.But the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me,aside from her very existence,is that it&#39;s opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the communitythat was hitherto hidden,the community of disabled people.And I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incrediblehow technology&#39;s been harnessed to prove beyond doubtthat disability is no barrierto the highest levels of sporting achievement.Of course there&#39;s a grimmer side to that truth,which is that it&#39;s actually taken decades for the world at largeto come to a position of trust,to really believe that disability and sports can go togetherin a convincing and interesting fashion.

We&#39;re all in thereand it&#39;s complete bedlam. You can&#39;t hear anything.No one&#39;s listening. No one&#39;s trusting.No one&#39;s responding to each other.Now in this room with these four disabled musicians,within five minutesa rapt listening, a rapt responseand some really insanely beautiful music.

zh-cn:查尔斯･海泽伍德：我多希望他们今天也能在这儿你们就能亲眼看到他们是多么非同寻常帕拉乐队就是这个项目的名字如果你们中的任何人想以任何方式帮助我们来实现这个目前还是个不大可能难以置信的梦请告诉我我的告别表演是关于约瑟夫･海登他是18世纪下半叶一个伟大的奥地利作曲家他和他的乐队受雇于尼古拉斯･埃司塔哈吉王子这个王子很喜欢他的音乐他也喜欢他一直居住的那个城堡它座落在奥地利匈牙利边境一个叫埃司塔哈吉的地方－离维也纳很远的地方
en:CH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today,so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are.Paraorchestra is the name of that project.If any of you thinks you want to help me in any wayto achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point,please let me know.Now my parting shotcomes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn,wonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century —spent the bulk of his lifein the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy, along with his orchestra.Now this prince loved his music,but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time,which is just on the Austro-Hungarian border,a place called Esterhazy —a long way from the big city of Vienna.
时间：14:57
zh-cn:1772年的一天王子谕知音乐家的家人乐队成员的家人不再受他欢迎他们不能再住在城堡里，他们必须返回维也纳－那可是段遥远的路途可以想像，音乐家们很伤心海登向王子抗议，但是没用鉴于王子热爱音乐海登写了一首交响曲来表达他的意愿
en:Now one day in 1772,the prince decreed that the musicians&#39; families,the orchestral musicians&#39; families,were no longer welcome in the castle.They weren&#39;t allowed to stay there anymore; they had to be returned to Vienna —as I say, an unfeasibly long way away in those days.You can imagine, the musicians were disconsolate.Haydn remonstrated with the prince, but to no avail.So given the prince loved his music,Haydn thought he&#39;d write a symphony to make the point.
时间：15:23
zh-cn:下面我们将演奏这首交响曲的结尾你能感受到一种阴郁的反抗我很高兴地说，王子从乐队的表演中感受到了乐队成员们能和家人一起了我想这能说明一切了有信任就有音乐－生命的延续没有信任音乐就会枯萎
en:And we&#39;re going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now.And you&#39;ll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt.I&#39;m pleased to say, the prince did take the tipfrom the orchestral performance,and the musicians were reunited with their families.But I think it sums up my talk rather well, this,that where there is trust,there is music — by extension life.Where there is no trust,the music quite simply withers away.
