zh-cn:大家好，我叫托马斯·赫斯维克我在伦敦有一间工作室专门用来设计建筑在我成长的过程中我接触过制造业手工业和材料业和小型的发明当我望向那些大型的建筑发现那些我们周围大型的建筑那些设计的建筑还有那些出版物上的建筑设计是那么无神和冷酷在那些小件的物品像耳环陶罐或是乐器都是实质化而且有神韵的这深深影响了我20年前我建造了第一座建筑自从那时，在最近的20年里我在伦敦设立了一个工作室对不起，顺便说一下，这是我的母亲在她伦敦的珠宝店我花了很多时间在数珍珠和相似的事情上
en:Hello, my name is Thomas Heatherwick.I have a studio in Londonthat has a particular approachto designing buildings.When I was growing up,I was exposed to makingand crafts and materialsand invention on a small scale.And I was there lookingat the larger scale of buildingsand findingthat the buildings that were around meand that were being designedand that were there in the publications I was seeingfelt soulless and cold.And there on the smaller scale,the scale of an earringor a ceramic potor a musical instrument,was a materiality and a soulfulness.And this influenced me.The first building I built was 20 years ago.And since, in the last 20 years,I&#39;ve developed a studio in London.Sorry, this was my mother, by the way,in her bead shop in London.I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that.

zh-cn:我现在要展示给那些不了解我工作室的人一些我们做过的项目这是一栋医院这是一间卖包的店这是艺术家的工作室这是一座用一百万码金属线和15万颗高尔夫球大小的玻璃珠做成的雕像而这是橱窗展示这是位于伦敦圣保罗大教堂附近的变电所的一对冷凝塔这是一座日本的佛教寺庙这是英国靠海的一座咖啡馆
en:I&#39;m just going to show, for people who don&#39;t know my studio&#39;s work,a few projects that we&#39;ve worked on.This is a hospital building.This is a shop for a bag company.This is studios for artists.This is a sculpturemade from a million yards of wireand 150,000 glass beadsthe size of a golf ball.And this is a window display.And this is pair of cooling towersfor an electricity substationnext to St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral in London.And this is a temple in Japanfor a Buddhist monk.And this is a cafe by the seain Britain.

zh-cn:大致的提一下一些我们最近接受的工作是受命于伦敦市长来设计一款能让乘客重获自由上下的公交车因为原本的双层巴士你们有些可能会熟悉是在后方有个开放式站台的—实际上，我觉得我们所有的双层巴士现在都在加利福尼亚了而不是在伦敦那当你困在车里如果汽车将要停靠但是离站点还有三码距离的话你就像个囚犯一般但是伦敦市长想重新引进这种有开放式站台的公车我们已经和伦敦交通局进行了合作这个部门已经有50年没有采购过新型的公交汽车了所以我们十分幸运有这次合作的机会简单的讲公车需要减少40%的能量消耗所以要采用混合型系统我们正在研发试着改进所有的方面从结构到设计建造美学
en:And just very quickly,something we&#39;ve been working on very recentlyis we were commissioned by the mayor of Londonto design a new busthat gave the passengertheir freedom again.Because the original Routemaster busthat some of you may be familiar with,which had this open platform at the back —in fact, I think all our Routemastersare here in California now actually.But they aren&#39;t in London.And so you&#39;re stuck on a bus.And if the bus is going to stopand it&#39;s three yards away from the bus stop,you&#39;re just a prisoner.But the mayor of London wanted to reintroducebuses with this open platform.So we&#39;ve been working with Transport for London,and that organizationhasn&#39;t actually been responsibleas a client for a new busfor 50 years.And so we&#39;ve been very lucky to have a chance to work.The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy.So it&#39;s got hybrid drive.And we&#39;ve been workingto try to improveeverything from the fabricto the formatand structureand aesthetics.

zh-cn:我将展示四个主要项目这是一个桥梁的项目我们被委托设计一座能开合的大桥这种开合型的似乎—每个人都喜欢开合型的桥但是有件事是很基本的我觉得我们都曾站在一旁观看过但是我们看到的桥一开一合—我是有点反感的—自从我看过那张铲球的足球运动员的照片当他在铲球的，另外一个人踩在了他的膝盖上面接着他的腿就像这样断了然后当我们看这些桥的时候就不经意间觉得这美丽的建筑就这样毁了
en:I was going to show four main projects.And this is a project for a bridge.And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open.And openings seemed —everyone loves opening bridges,but it&#39;s quite a basic thing.I think we all kind of stand and watch.But the bridges that we sawthat opened and closed —I&#39;m slightly squeamish —but I once saw a photograph of a footballerwho was diving for a ball.And as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee,and it had broken like this.And then we looked at these kinds of bridgesand just couldn&#39;t help feelingthat it was a beautiful thing that had broken.

zh-cn:这是在伦敦帕丁顿正如你看到的，这是一座很平常无趣的桥只用了钢筋和木材但是不去看他的材料我们更关注于它如何运作（掌声）我们喜欢这种桥两端最终互相吻合在一起的构想（掌声）实际上我们不得不把速度减半因为我们第一次做的时候每个人都吓坏了这是当它加速的情况
en:And so this is in Paddington in London.And it&#39;s a very boring bridge, as you can see.It&#39;s just steel and timber.But instead of what it is,our focus was on the way it worked.(Applause)So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of itwould end up kissing each other.(Applause)We actually had to halve its speed,because everyone was too scared when we first did it.So that&#39;s it speeded up.

zh-cn:近期我们着手的一个项目是设计一座生物化学能发电站—那种用有机废料的发电站在新闻界中我们未来水的来源和能源的来源相关的主题一直占据了所有的版面同时我们曾经对我们发电的方式表示自豪但是近期任何电力公司的年报都不会把发电站印在上面它们都印孩子跑过田野，或者类似的东西（TBR）
en:A project that we&#39;ve been working on very recentlyis to design a new biomass power station —so a power station that uses organic waste material.In the news,the subject of where our future water is going to come fromand where our power is going to come fromis in all the papers all the time.And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power.But recently,any annual report of a power companydoesn&#39;t have a power station on it.It has a child running through a field, or something like that.

zh-cn:所以当一个工程师联盟找到我们并询问我们和他们一起合作发电站项目我们的条件是我们能和他们合作还有，无论我们做什么我们不仅仅是在装修一座普通的发电站反而，我们需要学习—我们是逼迫他们教我们我们花时间和他们到处考察学习所有不同的设备并发现了有很多没有益处的低效率的设备那种找块地然后把所有设备组装在一起不是让它运作的最有效的方式
en:And so when a consortium of engineers approached usand asked us to work with them on this power station,our condition was that we would work with themand that, whatever we did,we were not just going to decorate a normal power station.And instead, we had to learn — we kind of forced them to teach us.And so we spent time traveling with themand learning about all the different elements,and finding that there were plenty of inefficienciesthat weren&#39;t being capitalized on.That just taking a field and banging all these things outisn&#39;t necessarily the most efficient way that they could work.
时间： 6:08
zh-cn:所以我们在寻找该如何组装所有的设备—而不只是胡乱的组装成型我们还发现—这块地区是英国最贫穷的地区之一这曾被票选为英国最不适合生活的地方未来将有2000户新房会建造在这发电站旁它引起来社会层面上的问题它拥有着象征性的意义我们应为我们能源的来源感到自豪而不是感到羞愧
en:So we looked at how we could compose all those elements —instead of just litter, create one composition.And what we found —this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain.It was voted the worst place in Britain to live.And there are 2,000 new homes being builtnext to this power station.So it felt this has a social dimension.It has a symbolic importance.And we should be proud of where our power is coming from,rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of.
时间： 6:38
zh-cn:我们正在寻找我们如何才能建造发电站而且，不是那种外围有很大的围栏把人们排斥在外的而是一个能吸引你的地方它要—让我想想—200尺高它就感觉好像我们在做的是一个电力公园并把整个地区都包括进去而且利用地区周边空余的土地我们能建造出一个安静的发电站因为土壤可以产生声波差同时我们也发现我们可以用一种更高效的建筑和一种划算的方式来建造这种建筑
en:So we were looking at how we could make a power station,that, instead of keeping people outand having a big fence around the outside,could be a place that pulls you in.And it has to be —I&#39;m trying to get my —250 feet high.So it felt that what we could try to dois make a power parkand actually bring the whole area in,and using the spare soil that&#39;s there on the site,we could make a power station that was silent as well.Because just that soilcould make the acoustic difference.And we also found that we could make a more efficient structureand have a cost-effective wayof making a structure to do this.
时间： 7:17
zh-cn:项目最终不仅仅只是一个发电站而已它成了一个你甚至可以在顶部开成人礼酒会的地方（笑声）这是一个电力公园人们可以切身的感受到还能眺望四周的景观并利用我们设计的高度
en:The finished projectis meant to be more than just a power station.It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.(Laughter)And it&#39;s a power park.So people can come and really experience thisand also look out all around the area,and use that height that we have to have for its function.

zh-cn:在上海我们被邀请建造—其实我们不是被邀请的；看我在说什么呢我们是赢得了比赛，这是一个艰辛的胜利（笑声）我们赢得了建造英国馆的比赛世博会完全就是件疯狂的事有250个场馆世上未曾有过的最大的世博会每天都有上百万的人参观有250个国家在竞争而英国政府说“你要进前五”这就成了政府的目标—就是，你如何在这混乱中脱颖而出在竞争如此刺激的世博会中？我们觉得我们要做一件事只要一件事而不是试着做每件事我们还觉得无论我们做什么我们也不能用廉价的方式展示英国
en:In Shanghai,we were invited to build —well we weren&#39;t invited; what am I talking about.We won the competition, and it was painful to get there.(Laughter)So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion.And an expois a totally bonkers thing.There&#39;s 250 pavilions.It&#39;s the world&#39;s biggest ever expo that had ever happened.So there are up to a million people there everyday.And 250 countries all competing.And the British government saying,&quot;You need to be in the top five.&quot;And so that becamethe governmental goal —is, how do you stand out in this chaos,which is an expo of stimulus?So our sense was we had to do one thing,and only one thing,instead of trying to have everything.And so what we also feltwas that whatever we did we couldn&#39;t do a cheesy advert for Britain.

zh-cn:（笑声）

zh-cn:但是有件事是真实的世博会是关于未来的城市特别是维多利亚时代的那些把自然融入城市的先驱世上现代社会中第一个大众开放的公园是在英国同时世上第一座大型植物机构是在伦敦它们有这一个特殊项目收集了地球上25%的植物我们突然间意识到这是件重要的事每个人都觉得树是美丽的我从来没听到有人说过 “我不喜欢树” 的花也是一样我从来没有听到有人说过 “我讨厌花” 的但是我们意识到种子—这已经进行为了一个很重要的项目—但是这些种子—在这些大型植物园种子是不展示的但是你只要去园地的角落它们在那小的纸袋里面但是这庞大的项目还在进行中我们意识到我们需要做这个项目利用种子，做成某种种子圣殿
en:But the thing that was true,the expo was about the future of cities,and particularly the Victorianspioneered integrating nature into the cities.And the world&#39;s first public park of modern timeswas in Britain.And the world&#39;s first major botanical institutionis in London,and they have this extraordinary projectwhere they&#39;ve been collecting 25 percentof all the world&#39;s plant species.So we suddenly realized that there was this thing.And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful,and I&#39;ve never met anyone who says, &quot;I don&#39;t like trees.&quot;And the same with flowers.I&#39;ve never met anyone who says, &quot;I don&#39;t like flowers.&quot;But we realized that seeds —there&#39;s been this very serious project happening —but that seeds —at these major botanical gardens,seeds aren&#39;t on show.But you just have to go to a garden center,and they&#39;re in little paper packets.But this phenomenal project&#39;s been happening.So we realized we had to make a projectthat would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral.

zh-cn:但是我们如何才能展示这种细小的东西呢？事实上电影 “侏罗纪公园” 帮了我们因为保留在琥珀里的恐龙DNA给了我们些思路那些细小的东西可以被保存也能做的很精致而不是看起来像坚果一样挑战就是我们将如何透过光展示这些东西？我们不想造一座独立的建造还独立的展示内容所以我们试想我们如何才能把事完整的展现出来提一下，我们的预算只有其他西方国家的一半这又要牵扯到足球场大小的场地问题有件特殊的玩具给了我们灵感
en:But how could we show these teeny-weeny things?And the film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; actually really helped us.Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the ambergave us some kind of cluethat these tiny thingscould be trapped and be made to seem precious,rather than looking like nuts.So the challenge was,how are we going to bring light and expose these things?We didn&#39;t want to make a separate building and have separate content.So we were trying to think,how could we make a whole thing emanate.By the way, we had half the budget of the other Western nations.So that was also in the mixwith the site the size of a football pitch.And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue.

zh-cn:好的，你懂了吧这想法就是用66000粒它们许诺给我们的种子把每个种子都包裹进这些昂贵的光学发丝让它通过盒子向外延伸一个很简易的盒子造型就让建造随风摆动以此整栋建筑可以在微风下轻轻的摆动而白天，内部—每根发丝都是一个光学设备并把光线带到每个角落晚上的话每根发丝的人造光发光并照射到外部的设施为了平衡项目的预算我们主攻能源板块而不是把建筑造的和足球场一样大我们把注意力集中到这一元素上政府同意这么做不做出其他调整而是集中在能源的方面所以地块其余部分就是公共场所每天一百万的游客提供一些公共空间也是合理的
en:Thomas Heatherwick: Okay, you get the idea.So the ideawas to take these 66,000 seedsthat they agreed to give us,and to take each seed and trap itin this precious optical hairand grow that through this box,very simple box element,and make it a buildingthat could move in the wind.So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows.And inside, the daylight —each one is an opticand it brings light into the center.And by night,artificial light in each oneemanates and comes out to the outside.And to make the project affordable,we focused our energy.Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch,we focused it on this one element.And the government agreed to do thatand not do anything else,and focus our energy on that.And so the rest of the site was a public space.And with a million people there a day,it just felt like offering some public space.

zh-cn:我们和 Astro Turf制造商合作打造一座小型版本的种子圣殿因此，就算你的视力不好这也会看起来蓬松柔软你看到这样感觉的景致接着，你知道宠物做手术的时候他们会把一部分的毛剃光露出一整块的皮肤—为了让你进入这种子圣殿实际上，我们也把它剃了
en:We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturerto develop a mini-me versionof the seed cathedral,so that, even if you&#39;re partially-sighted,that it was kind of crunchy and soft,that piece of landscape that you see there.And then, you know when a pet has an operationand they shave a bit of the skinand get rid of the fur —in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral,in effect, we&#39;ve shaved it.

zh-cn:内部空无一物没有著名演员的声音没有放映室没有电视；也没有色彩的变化有的只是安静和凉爽的温度如果乌云经过的话你们在从光线投入的顶层看到那乌云这是我们做的唯一的项目完成之后看起来更像是有自我的演示
en:And inside there&#39;s nothing;there&#39;s no famous actor&#39;s voice;there&#39;s no projections;there&#39;s no televisions; there&#39;s no color changing.There&#39;s just silenceand a cool temperature.And if a cloud goes past,you can see a cloud on the tipswhere it&#39;s letting the light through.This is the only project that we&#39;ve donewhere the finished thinglooked more like a rendering than our renderings.
时间：12:34
zh-cn:（笑声）
en:(Laughter)
时间：12:40
zh-cn:关键在于如何让人们与之互动我指，你能在世博会上有可能做的最疯狂的事情我刚刚给大家看的英国政府—任何政府都是世上你最不想要的最糟糕的客户因为它的要求太恐怖了但是它还是有基本的支持的所以在那时刻突然间—实际上，接下来的事情是英国贸易投资部的部长我们的客户和中国的孩子们，利用这块空间
en:A key thing was how people would interact.I mean, in a way it was the most serious thingyou could possible do at the expo.And I just wanted to show you.The British government —any government is potentially the worst client in the worldyou could ever possibly want to have.And there was a lot of terror.But there was an underlying support.And so there was a momentwhen suddenly — actually, the next thing.This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment,who was our client,with the Chinese children, using the landscape.

zh-cn:最后，质感是很重要的在我们着手的项目中这种精美的建筑它们可能有着奇幻的外形但是本质上是一样的是最近我们一直在尝试探索研究的替代物我们在拿来西亚建设的项目一个开发商的公寓大楼这是那块土地就在这里吉隆坡市长说，如果开发商能在开发的同时给予城市回报的话他们可以给予他们更多的未开发的建设用土地这激励开发商去尝试思考如何把城市建的更好
en:So finally, texture is something.In the projects we&#39;ve been working on,these slick buildings,where they might be a fancy shape,but the materiality feels the same,is something that we&#39;ve been trying to research really,and explore alternatives.And the project that we&#39;re building in Malaysiais apartment buildingsfor a property developer.And it&#39;s in a piece of landthat&#39;s this site.And the mayor of Kuala Lumpursaid that, if this developerwould give something that gave something back to the city,they would give them more gross floor area, buildable.So there was an incentive for the developerto really try to think aboutwhat would be better for the city.
时间：14:21
zh-cn:公寓建筑最平常的东西根据世界某些地域是你有自己的大楼你在边缘种植一些树开辟停车场其实你只有在底层几楼才能真正体验到其他的楼层得到的只是展示而已像这种大楼最底层价值是最低的如果我们去除这部分造个小型的底层我们就可以把价值附加到顶层去这样可以让开发商利润最大化通过连接这些我们可以把90%的土地变成雨林而不是只有10%的矮树和建筑周边的道路
en:And the conventional thing with apartment buildingsin this part of the worldis you have your tower,and you squeeze a few trees around the edge,and you see cars parked.It&#39;s actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience,and the rest of it is just for postcards.The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this.So if we could chop that awayand give the building a small bottom,we could take that bit and put it at the topwhere the greater commercial value is for a property developer.And by linking these together,we could have 90 percent of the siteas a rainforest,instead of only 10 percent of scrubby treesand bits of road around buildings.

zh-cn:（掌声）
en:(Applause)
时间：15:06
zh-cn:我们建设的这些建筑他们实际上是相同的，都符合成本效益只是用了不同高度但是关键是试着还给土地一片别致的景观而不是践踏它这是我最后一张幻灯片
en:So we&#39;re building these buildings.They&#39;re actually identical, so it&#39;s quite cost-effective.They&#39;re just chopped at different heights.But the key partis trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape,rather than engulf it.And that&#39;s my final slide.

zh-cn:我们在建造的时候做了一些测试一共有6万6千个这光学设备22尺长所以日光可以照射进去—从盒子的外面进入一直传输到每个种子的地方防水的大楼是有点疯狂的因为怎么说大楼防水就是很困难的更别提你是有66000个孔在上面了—我们的确耗费了很长时间在承包商中有个体型刚好的工作人员当然不是小孩—可以进入两者间的空隙做最后的大楼防水工作
en:TH: These are a few of the tests we didwhen we were building the structure.So there were 66,000 of these.This opticwas 22 feet long.And so the daylight was just coming —it was caught on the outside of the boxand was coming down to illuminate each seed.Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy.Because it&#39;s quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway,but if you say you&#39;re going to drill 66,000 holes in it —we had quite a time.There was one person in the contractors who was the right size —and it wasn&#39;t a child —who could fit between themfor the final waterproofing of the building.
