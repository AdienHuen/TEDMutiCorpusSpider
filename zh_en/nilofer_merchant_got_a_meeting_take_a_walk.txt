zh-cn:你正在做的事现在，此时此刻将造成致命伤害比汽车或网络甚至比我们不断讨论的移动设备更加致命这是一项几乎每一天你使用最多的技术就是这个，你的臀部现在人们每天坐 9.3 小时比睡眠时间－ 7.7 小时还多“坐”如同家常便饭我们甚至不曾质疑自己坐了多久因为每个人都这么做我们甚至不曾想过这并不健康因此“坐”已成为这个时代的烟害
en:What you&#39;re doing,right now, at this very moment,is killing you.More than cars or the Internetor even that little mobile device we keep talking about,the technology you&#39;re using the most almost every dayis this, your tush.Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day,which is more than we&#39;re sleeping, at 7.7 hours.Sitting is so incredibly prevalent,we don&#39;t even question how much we&#39;re doing it,and because everyone else is doing it,it doesn&#39;t even occur to us that it&#39;s not okay.In that way, sitting has becomethe smoking of our generation.

zh-cn:这当然对健康有所影响围绕腰部产生的可怕问题例如乳癌与大肠癌等疾病与缺乏活动息息相关以上两项疾病的罹患率因此增加10 %心脏病罹患率因此增加 6 %第二型糖尿病罹患率因此增加 7 %这正是我父亲的死因现在，这些统计应该能说服我们多起身走动但如果你像我这么懒，绝对办不到
en:Of course there&#39;s health consequences to this,scary ones, besides the waist.Things like breast cancer and colon cancerare directly tied to our lack of physical [activity],Ten percent in fact, on both of those.Six percent for heart disease,seven percent for type 2 diabetes,which is what my father died of.Now, any of those stats should convince each of usto get off our duff more,but if you&#39;re anything like me, it won&#39;t.

zh-cn:让我动起来的力量来自于一场社交活动某人邀请我参加一场会议但无法安排我进行一般室内会议，于是他说「我明天得遛狗，妳方便来吗？」这似乎有点怪事实上，记得首次进行这种会议时，我不断思索「我得设法开口问下一个问题」「因为我知道谈话进行时」「我将气喘如牛」但我借用这种做法，让它成了我的点子因此我不举行喝咖啡聊天的会议或在日光灯下进行室内会议我邀请人们进行散步会议平均每周步行 20 至 30 英哩这改变了我的生活
en:What did get me moving was a social interaction.Someone invited me to a meeting,but couldn&#39;t manage to fit me into a regular sort of conference room meeting, and said,&quot;I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?&quot;It seemed kind of odd to do,and actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking,&quot;I have to be the one to ask the next question,&quot;because I knew I was going to huff and puffduring this conversation.And yet, I&#39;ve taken that idea and made it my own.So instead of going to coffee meetingsor fluorescent-lit conference room meetings,I ask people to go on a walking meeting,to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week.It&#39;s changed my life.

zh-cn:但在此之前的实际情况是我曾经认为你可以设法顾及自己的健康或设法顾及应尽的职责但无法两者兼顾因此，历经数百次散步会议后我学到几件事
en:But before that, what actually happened was,I used to think about it as,you could take care of your health,or you could take care of obligations,and one always came at the cost of the other.So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later,I&#39;ve learned a few things.

zh-cn:首先，跳脱既有框架确实令人惊喜万分可激发出创造性思维无论原因在于大自然或运动本身，这确实有效
en:First, there&#39;s this amazing thingabout actually getting out of the boxthat leads to out-of-the-box thinking.Whether it&#39;s nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works.

zh-cn:其次，这或许是更让人深思的一点就是关于我们对对立问题的兼容性当问题本身并非如此时如果我们打算解决问题以截然不同的眼光看待世事无论是针对时政或商业或环境问题、就业问题或许我们可以思考如何跳脱问题的框架兼顾所有需求因为这是随着边走边谈的想法产生的念头使一切变得可行、兼容并蓄
en:And second, and probably the more reflective one,is just about how much each of uscan hold problems in oppositionwhen they&#39;re really not that way.And if we&#39;re going to solve problemsand look at the world really differently,whether it&#39;s in governance or businessor environmental issues, job creation,maybe we can think about how to reframe those problemsas having both things be true.Because it was when that happenedwith this walk-and-talk ideathat things became doable and sustainable and viable.

zh-cn:我以臀部作为这场演讲的开场白因此我将以一句话收&quot;尾&quot;，那就是边走边谈边谈边走你将惊讶于新鲜空气如何激发创新思维藉由这种方式你将为生活带来一套崭新的观点
en:So I started this talk talking about the tush,so I&#39;ll end with the bottom line, which is,walk and talk.Walk the talk.You&#39;ll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking,and in the way that you do,you&#39;ll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas.
