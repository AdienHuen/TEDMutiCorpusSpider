zh-cn:我在蒙太拿长大有两个梦想一个是成为古生物学家研究恐龙的古生物学家一个是拥有一个小恐龙作为宠物这是我整个生命中工作的动力我很幸运在我职业生涯的早期我在发掘方面很走运我不擅长于阅读事实上，我并不读什么文献我在阅读方面有障碍阅读对我来说是最难的事但是我走出去，发掘东西我就能获得信息基本上我是靠在街上捡钱来训练的（笑声）我对山陵感兴趣也发现了一些东西
en:When I was growing up in Montana,I had two dreams.I wanted to be a paleontologist,a dinosaur paleontologist,and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.And so that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been striving forall of my life.I was very fortunateearly in my career.I was fortunatein finding things.I wasn&#39;t very good at reading things.In fact, I don&#39;t read much of anything.I am extremely dyslexic,and so reading is the hardest thing I do.But instead, I go out and I find things.Then I just pick things up.I basically practice for finding money on the street.(Laughter)And I wander about the hills,and I have found a few things.

zh-cn:特别幸运的是我发现了西半球上第一个恐龙蛋第一个还在巢中的恐龙宝宝第一个恐龙胚胎还有数量巨大的恐龙骨头那时刚好是人们开始认识到恐龙并不是笨重的爬虫的时期人们从前这样想了很多年那时大家开始觉得恐龙其实挺特别的
en:And I have been fortunate enoughto find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphereand the first baby dinosaurs in nests,the first dinosaur embryosand massive accumulations of bones.And it happened to be at a timewhen people were just starting to begin to realizethat dinosaurs weren&#39;t the big, stupid, green reptilesthat people had thought for so many years.People were starting to get an ideathat dinosaurs were special.

zh-cn:所以那时候我有机会试验很多理论当然还有我的同僚们我们能够证明恐龙——从我们有的证据来看——恐龙能建巢群居生活能够照料幼小宝宝捕食回巢给宝宝吃迁移的时候是大群一起走的这些都很有趣我还进一步发现恐龙其实是非常社会性的动物我们有很多证据说明恐龙在从少年到成年的期间变化巨大它们的外表很不一样——这在社会性的动物中可见在动物的社会群体中少年们总是和成年动物看起来不一样的这样成年动物就能认出少年动物少年们也能认出成年动物我们这样就对恐龙是什么样的动物有了一个宏观的看法它们并不是仅仅乱追吉普车的
en:And so, at that time,I was able to make some interesting hypothesesalong with my colleagues.We were able to actually saythat dinosaurs — based on the evidence we had —that dinosaurs built nestsand lived in coloniesand cared for their young,brought food to their babiesand traveled in gigantic herds.So it was pretty interesting stuff.I have gone on to find more thingsand discover that dinosaurs really were very social.We have found a lot of evidencethat dinosaurs changedfrom when they were juveniles to when they were adults.The appearance of them would have been different —which it is in all social animals.In social groups of animals,the juveniles always look different than the adults.The adults can recognize the juveniles;the juveniles can recognize the adults.And so we&#39;re making a better pictureof what a dinosaur looks like.And they didn&#39;t just all chase Jeeps around.

zh-cn:我想正是这社会性引起了迈克尔·克赖顿的兴趣在他的书里，他讲到了这个社会性接着斯蒂文·斯皮尔伯格，当然了把恐龙们描绘成非常社会性的动物他们故事的主题是重造恐龙这样我们就有了“侏罗纪公园”的故事迈克尔·克赖顿其实是第一批人开始谈论怎么重新让恐龙复生的你们都知道这个故事吧我指假设每个人都看过“侏罗纪公园”
en:But it is that social thingthat I guess attracted Michael Crichton.And in his book, he talked about the social animals.And then Steven Spielberg, of course,depicts these dinosaursas being very social creatures.The theme of this story is building a dinosaur,and so we come to that part of &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;Michael Crichton really was one of the first peopleto talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.You all know the story, right.I mean, I assume everyone here has seen &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;

zh-cn:如果你想造出个恐龙你出去找一块石化的天然树脂——也就是所谓的琥珀——找一个有吸血昆虫的质量好的这样你有了昆虫，就钻个洞进去吸出一些DNA当然了，因为那时候所有的吸血昆虫都吸的是恐龙的DNA你把DNA拿回实验室克隆一把我猜是通过把DNA注射到一个鸵鸟蛋里或者别的什么大蛋你就等吧运气好的话，小恐龙就破壳而出啦皆大欢喜（笑声）皆大欢喜一次又一次之后他们不断克隆，不断造恐龙然后这么多恐龙就社交起来啦社会性十足它们聚到一起密谋策反当然了，这就成就了斯蒂文·斯皮尔伯格的电影——造反的恐龙把人追得到处跑
en:If you want to make a dinosaur,you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap —otherwise known as amber —that has some blood-sucking insects in it,good ones,and you get your insect and you drill into itand you suck out some DNA,because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those dayssucked dinosaur DNA out.And you take your DNA back to the laboratoryand you clone it.And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg,or something like that,and then you wait,and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.And everybody&#39;s happy about that.(Laughter)And they&#39;re happy over and over again.They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.And then, then, then, and then ...Then the dinosaurs, being social,act out their socialness,and they get together,and they conspire.And, of course, that&#39;s what makes Steven Spielberg&#39;s movie —conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.

zh-cn:我假定每个人都知道如果你真的拿一块琥珀，有昆虫的钻个洞得到一些原料克隆一把，重复做这件事你只能得到一屋子的蚊子（笑声）（掌声）可能还不济一些树木
en:So I assume everybody knowsthat if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it,and you drilled into it,and you got something out of that insect,and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again,you&#39;d have a room full of mosquitos.(Laughter)(Applause)And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.

zh-cn:你想要恐龙的DNA就要在恐龙身上找这正是我们的策略回溯到1993年，当这个电影开始放映时我们其实已经拿了国家科学基金，在试图从恐龙化石中提取DNA我们选了图上左边的恐龙是个暴龙化石，保存得很好的标本我当时的一个博士生现在是玛丽·施韦策博士了有做类似研究的基础所以她在这个暴龙的骨头里一条大腿骨里找到了一些非常有趣的组织他们发现了红色的，圆形的东西特别像红细胞它们正好在血管里在骨头中间所以她就想，不如一试她提取了一些组织出来这些不是DNA，她没找到DNA但是她发现了原血红素正是血红素的基础这是个大发现非常有趣这可是六千五百万年前的原血红素我们试了很久没得到任何结果
en:Now if you want dinosaur DNA,I say go to the dinosaur.So that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done.Back in 1993 when the movie came out,we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundationto attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur,and we chose the dinosaur on the left,a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.And one of my former doctoral students,Dr. Mary Schweitzer,actually had the backgroundto do this sort of thing.And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex,one of the thigh bones,and she actually foundsome very interesting structures in there.They found these red circular-looking objects,and they looked, for all the world,like red blood cells.And they&#39;re inwhat appear to be the blood channelsthat go through the bone.And so she thought, well, what the heck.So she sampled some material out of it.Now it wasn&#39;t DNA; she didn&#39;t find DNA.But she did find heme,which is the biological foundationof hemoglobin.And that was really cool.That was interesting.That was — here we have 65-million-year-old heme.Well we tried and triedand we couldn&#39;t really get anything else out of it.

zh-cn:几年过去了我们开始了地狱溪计划这个地狱溪计划是一场大发掘目的是挖出尽量多的恐龙化石希望发现一些恐龙化石是有更多的遗传物质的在蒙太拿东部那里有很多空地，很多不毛之地没有什么居民你可就出去找到很多东西我们也的确发现了很多东西我们发现了很多暴龙化石其中一种很特殊叫做B型暴龙B型暴龙是在一片上千立方的岩石群下发现的这并不完全是暴龙也不是特别大的暴龙但是这是一种十分特殊的B型暴龙我和同事们把化石切开我们能够确定从看骨头里的生长线，这个B型暴龙是十六岁时死的我们并不知道恐龙一般活多久因为我们还没找到最老的但是这只恐龙在十六岁时死去
en:So a few years went by,and then we started the Hell Creek Project.And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertakingto get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find,and hopefully find some dinosaursthat had more material in them.And out in eastern Montanathere&#39;s a lot of space, a lot of badlands,and not very many people,and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.And we did find a lot of stuff.We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs,but we found one special Tyrannosaur,and we called it B-rex.And B-rex was foundunder a thousand cubic yards of rock.It wasn&#39;t a very complete T. rex,and it wasn&#39;t a very big T. rex,but it was a very special B-rex.And I and my colleagues cut into it,and we were able to determine,by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it,that B-rex had died at the age of 16.We don&#39;t really know how long dinosaurs lived,because we haven&#39;t found the oldest one yet.But this one died at the age of 16.

zh-cn:我们把样本给玛丽·施韦策她能确定这个B型暴龙是雌性因为骨头里的髓状组织的样子髓状组织全是积累的钙也就是钙库动物怀孕时会产生鸟类怀孕时也会产生这是一个把鸟类和恐龙连起来的特征玛丽继续探索她把骨头放入酸中我们知道骨头已经变成化石了所以把化石放在酸里应该会全溶解但是这次有些东西不溶它们就是血管这些是柔韧的，透明的血管也是第一次在恐龙化石里发现软组织这非常了不起她还发现了骨细胞也就是组成骨头的细胞通过不断试验，我们还是没有发现DNA但是她发现了蛋白质
en:We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer,and she was actually able to determinethat B-rex was a femalebased on medullary tissuefound on the inside of the bone.Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up,the calcium storage basically,when an animal is pregnant,when a bird is pregnant.So here was the characterthat linked birds and dinosaurs.But Mary went further.She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.Now we all know that bones are fossilized,and so if you dump it into acid,there shouldn&#39;t be anything left.But there was something left.There were blood vessels left.There were flexible, clear blood vessels.And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.It was extraordinary.But she also found osteocytes,which are the cells that laid down the bones.And try and try, we could not find DNA,but she did find evidence of proteins.

zh-cn:我们认为——仅仅是认为在组织被发掘出来后，它们就很快降解了我们认为这些组织降解的很快所以我们就在一个十八轮的大方车里造了个实验室把实验室带到野外我们发掘样本的地方我们这样做了，也得到了更好的样本细胞看起来更好血管看起来更好胶原蛋白更好这都很完美但是还是找不到恐龙的DNA我们已经知道恐龙的DNA，或者说所有的DNA实在是降解的太快了我们就是不能够像电影“侏罗纪公园”里一样得到DNA我们不能用恐龙来重造恐龙
en:But we thought maybe —well, we thought maybethat the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.And so we built a laboratoryin the back of an 18-wheeler trailer,and actually took the laboratory to the fieldwhere we could get better samples.And we did. We got better material.The cells looked better.The vessels looked better.Found the protein collagen.I mean, it was wonderful stuff.But it&#39;s not dinosaur DNA.So we have discoveredthat dinosaur DNA, and all DNA,just breaks down too fast.We&#39;re just not going to be ableto do what they did in &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;We&#39;re not going to be able to make a dinosaurbased on a dinosaur.

zh-cn:但是还在鸟类就是恐龙鸟类是活恐龙我们其实把鸟类归为和恐龙一类我们现在管恐龙叫非鸟类恐龙管鸟类叫鸟类恐龙所以这些非鸟类恐龙就是那些已经灭绝了的大家伙鸟类恐龙就是我们现代的鸟类我们不需要造什么恐龙我们已经有啦
en:But birds are dinosaurs.Birds are living dinosaurs.We actually classify themas dinosaurs.We now call them non-avian dinosaursand avian dinosaurs.So the non-avian dinosaursare the big clunky ones that went extinct.Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.So we don&#39;t have to make a dinosaurbecause we already have them.

en:I know, you&#39;re as bad as the sixth-graders.(Laughter)The sixth-graders look at it and they say, &quot;No.&quot;(Laughter)&quot;You can call it a dinosaur,but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool.&quot;(Laughter)&quot;The chicken is not.&quot;(Laughter)So this is our problem,as you can imagine.The chicken is a dinosaur.I mean it really is.You can&#39;t argue with itbecause we&#39;re the classifiers and we&#39;ve classified it that way.(Laughter)(Applause)But the sixth-graders demand it.&quot;Fix the chicken.&quot;(Laughter)So that&#39;s what I&#39;m here to tell you about:how we are going to fix a chicken.
时间：10:48
zh-cn:我们有几种方法可以把鸡改造成恐龙因为有进化我们可以用进化的方法我们管它叫生物改良法我们可以选择我们也知道选择是可行的我们从一只狼一样的动物开始最后得到一个马耳他人我是说，这真的——真的是基因改良工程或者任何其它有趣的好看的小狗我们还有转基因技术转基因也是很有用的工具你把一个动物的基因拿出来，放在另一个动物里这就是怎么做荧光鱼的你拿一个荧光的基因从珊瑚或者水母中来放在斑马鱼体内它们就能发荧光很奇妙吧人们用这个赚大钱现在他们在做荧光兔荧光很多东西我就想我们可以做个荧光鸡（笑声）但是我不认为这能够说服六年级学生
en:So we have a number of waysthat we actually can fix the chicken.Because evolution works,we actually have some evolutionary tools.We&#39;ll call them biological modification tools.We have selection.And we know selection works.We started out with a wolf-like creatureand we ended up with a Maltese.I mean, that&#39;s —that&#39;s definitely genetic modification.Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.We also have transgenesis.Transgenesis is really cool too.That&#39;s where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.That&#39;s how people make GloFish.You take a glow geneout of a coral or a jellyfishand you stick it in a zebrafish,and, puff, they glow.And that&#39;s pretty cool.And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.And now they&#39;re making Glow-rabbitsand Glow-all-sorts-of-things.I guess we could make a glow chicken.(Laughter)But I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll satisfy the sixth-graders either.

zh-cn:还有一个武器叫做返祖激活返祖激活其实就是——返祖现象就是重现祖先的特征你听过有些孩子出生时有小尾巴这就是返祖现象有些返祖现象常常发生蛇有时有腿这就是个例子这是个生下来有牙齿的鸡一个叫马修·海瑞斯的人在威斯康辛麦迪逊大学工作发现了如何刺激牙齿基因的生长所以他能够让牙齿基因生长在鸡身上长牙齿这是个好的特征我们能保留这个科技我们能用这个我们可以让鸡生牙齿这离恐龙就近了一步比荧光鸡要有用
en:But there&#39;s another thing.There&#39;s what we call atavism activation.And atavism activationis basically —an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.You heardthat occasionally children are born with tails,and it&#39;s because it&#39;s an ancestral characteristic.And so there are a number of atavismsthat can happen.Snakes are occasionally born with legs.And here&#39;s an example.This is a chicken with teeth.A fellow by the name of Matthew Harrisat the University of Wisconsin in Madisonactually figured out a way to stimulatethe gene for teeth,and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene onand produce teeth in chickens.Now that&#39;s a good characteristic.We can save that one.We know we can use that.We can make a chicken with teeth.That&#39;s getting closer.That&#39;s better than a glowing chicken.

zh-cn:我有个朋友，一个同事在麦克吉尔大学的汉斯·拉尔森博士在研究返祖现象他研究返祖是通过研究鸟的胚胎发育看它们是怎么发育的他对鸟类的尾巴是怎么消失的感兴趣他同时也对前肢，爪子，和翅膀的变化感兴趣他也研究有关的基因我说：“如果你能找到这些基因，我就能靠让它们倒行逆施，得到六年级学生要求的恐龙鸡”他同意了这就是我们研究的东西
en:A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University,is actually looking at atavisms.And he&#39;s looking at themby looking at the embryo genesis of birdsand actually looking at how they develop,and he&#39;s interested in how birds actually lost their tail.He&#39;s also interested in the transformationof the arm, the hand, to the wing.He&#39;s looking for those genes as well.And I said, &quot;Well, if you can find those,I can just reverse themand make what I need to make for the sixth-graders.&quot;And so he agreed.And so that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking into.
时间：13:51
zh-cn:如果你注意恐龙的爪子迅猛龙有特殊的手掌，末端有爪子始祖鸟，其实是鸟，一个鸟类的先祖还有着先祖的手掌但是你可以看到，鸽子或者鸡，或者其它任何一个鸟类都有这样怪怪的手掌因为手变成了翅膀但是有趣的是如果你看它们的胚胎在胚胎发育的时候州长其实看起来像是始祖鸟的手掌三个手指，三个脚趾但是后来一个基因开始运作，使得手指脚趾都混合在一起了我们就在找这个基因我们希望防止这个基因运作不让手掌混合在一起我们就能得到三个手指的鸡就像始祖鸟一样对尾巴也一样鸟类其实有没发育完的尾巴我们知道在胚胎中当动物发育时有个其实很长的尾巴但是一个基因开始运作消融了尾巴，它就消失了这就是我们在找的另一个基因我们希望防止尾巴被消融
en:If you look at dinosaur hands,a velociraptorhas that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird,still has that very primitive hand.But as you can see, the pigeon,or a chicken or anything else, another bird,has kind of a weird-looking hand,because the hand is a wing.But the cool thing isthat, if you look in the embryo,as the embryo is developingthe hand actually lookspretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.It has the three fingers, the three digits.But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.And so what we&#39;re looking for is that gene.We want to stop that gene from turning on,fusing those hands together,so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,like the archaeopteryx.And the same goes for the tails.Birds have basicallyrudimentary tails.And so we knowthat in embryo,as the animal is developing,it actually has a relatively long tail.But a gene turns onand resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.So that&#39;s the other gene we&#39;re looking for.We want to stop that tail from resorbing.

zh-cn:所以我们试图做的是拿一只鸡改造它并造出鸡恐龙（笑声）这鸡看起来就酷多了但是这只是非常基本的改造这就是我们在做的东西人们总是问：“为什么做这个？为什么造那个？有什么好处？”这是个好问题事实上，我想这是教孩子进化论和发育生物学和其它很多东西的最好方法坦白说我认为如果肯德基山德士上校当年想得开阔一些，他的措辞留心一下说不定也能为鸡恐龙作上额外广告（笑声）
en:So what we&#39;re trying to do reallyis take our chicken,modify itand make the chickenosaurus.(Laughter)It&#39;s a cooler-looking chicken.But it&#39;s just the very basics.So that really is what we&#39;re doing.And people always say, &quot;Why do that?Why make this thing?What good is it?&quot;Well, that&#39;s a good question.Actually, I think it&#39;s a great way to teach kidsabout evolutionary biologyand developmental biologyand all sorts of things.And quite frankly, I thinkif Colonel Sanderswas to be careful how he worded it,he could actually advertise an extra piece.(Laughter)
