zh-cn:去年我把最美好的时光用于制作一部关于我自己的幸福的纪录片来试试我是否能用一种特殊方法来训练我的大脑就像锻炼身体一样,从而让我可以感觉到一种创造出来的幸福今年一月份的时候我妈过世了于是创作这部电影看起来就成为了唯一让我有兴趣的事情了因此在一种非常典型的，傻傻的设计下在多年有价值的工作之后我要展示的所有东西就是这部电影的标题
en:I spent the best part of last yearworking on a documentaryabout my own happiness —trying to seeif I can actually train my mindin a particular way,like I can train my body,so I can end up with an improved feelingof overall well-being.Then this January,my mother died,and pursuing a film like thatjust seemed the last thing that was interesting to me.So in a very typical, silly designer fashion,after years worth of work,pretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film.

zh-cn:他们仍然在创作当我和我的朋友们在印度尼西亚休假的时候我们可以看到第一部分是由猪设计的它的味道有点臭我们还需要一些女性的观点于是我们雇了一只鸭子它用更恰当的方式完成了创作—时尚我在巴厘岛的工作室距离一个猴子森林仅有10分钟的路程猴子，当然被认为是最快乐的动物于是我们训练它们创作出三个不同的字母并把它们摆好你可以看到这里还是有点明显的问题那衬线字体没完全到位当然,你自己没有做好的事情从来都不能算真正的完成因此 这是我们自己爬上树并且放在印度尼西亚的萨扬谷上
en:They were still donewhen I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia.We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs.It was a little bit too funky,and we wanted a more feminine point of viewand employed a duckwho did it in a much more fitting way —fashion.My studio in Baliwas only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest,and monkeys, of course,are supposed to be the happiest of all animals.So we trained them to be able to do three separate words,to lay out them properly.You can see,there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there.The serif is not really in place.So of course, what you don&#39;t do properly yourselfis never deemed done really.So this is us climbing onto the treesand putting it up over the Sayan Valleyin Indonesia.

zh-cn:去年，我做的最多的事情就是看了各种调查看了在这个领域的许多数据这些数据显示男人和女人幸福的程度非常相似快速地浏览一下我了解过的研究气候对幸福感没什么影响如果你住在气候最好的地方在美国的圣地亚哥或者在气候最差的地方，纽约州水牛城幸福感在这两个地方是相同的如果你在美国一年挣超过5万美元薪水的增长只会对你总体的幸福感有很小很小的影响黑人和白人的幸福感是相同的不论年老还是年少幸福感都没什么区别不论你是丑，还是热别特别漂亮幸福感也没什么差别你会适应和习惯它如果你患有可控的疾病一般也没什么差别
en:In that year, what I did do a lotwas look at all sorts of surveys,looking at a lot of data on this subject.And it turns outthat men and womenreport very, very similar levels of happiness.This is a very quick overviewof all the studies that I looked at.That climate plays no role.That if you live in the best climate,in San Diego in the United States,or in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York,you are going to be just as happyin either place.If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S.,any salary increase you&#39;re going to experiencewill have only a tiny, tiny influenceon your overall well-being.Black people are just as happy as white people are.If you&#39;re old or youngit doesn&#39;t really make a difference.If you&#39;re ugly or if you&#39;re really, really good-lookingit makes no difference whatsoever.You will adapt to it and get used to it.If you have manageable health problemsit doesn&#39;t really matter.

zh-cn:现在有差别的来了右边的女性实际上要远幸福于左边的男性也就是说，如果你有许多朋友并且你有真正的友谊这就会造成很大的差异了已婚者—你们可能比那些单身的人幸福的多
en:Now this does matter.So now the woman on the rightis actually much happier than the guy on the left —meaning that, if you have a lot of friends,and you have meaningful friendships,that does make a lot of difference.As well as being married — you are likely to be much happierthan if you are single.

zh-cn:一个TED的演讲者，乔纳森·海特用了一个很好的比喻来形容意识和潜意识他说意识就像这个小小的骑手骑在大象上大象则代表潜意识骑手觉得他可以告知大象去做什么但是大象实际上也有它自己的想法如果我看看自己的生活我生在1962年的奥地利如果我早生100年有些人生命运其实早就注定了—我也许将会待在我出生的城镇很有可能从事我父辈所从事的领域也很有可能会娶一位母亲为我挑选的女孩儿我，当然，我们所有的人都可以自己为自己人生中的重大决定做主我们生活在自己喜欢的地方—至少在西部我们做着我们确实感兴趣的事情我们自己选择专业领域自己选择伙伴真是太奇妙了我们中的大部分让自己的潜意识影响了我们所作的决定这些影响的方法我们都没意识到
en:A fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt,came up with this beautiful little analogybetween the conscious and the unconscious mind.He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rideron this giant elephant, the unconscious.And the rider thinksthat he can tell the elephant what to do,but the elephant really has his own ideas.If I look at my own life,I&#39;m born in 1962 in Austria.If I would have been born a hundred years earlier,the big decisions in my life would have been made for me —meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in;I would have very much likelyentered the same profession that my dad did;and I would have very much likely married a womanthat my mom had selected.I, of course, and all of us,are very much in chargeof these big decisions in our lives.We live where we want to be —at least in the West.We become what we really are interested in.We choose our own profession,and we choose our own partners.And so it&#39;s quite surprisingthat many of uslet our unconscious influence those decisionsin ways that we are not quite aware of.

zh-cn:如果你看一下数据你会发现一个叫做乔治的人当他决定他希望住在哪时—佛罗里达还是北达科他？—他住在了佐治亚如果你看一个叫丹尼斯的人但他决定做什么职业的时候—是做一名律师，或者是一位医生亦或是老师？—最大的可能性是他想成为一名牙医如果保拉选择是应该嫁给乔还是杰克不知道为什么保罗这个名字听起来最有兴趣所以即使我们因为一个可笑的原因作出重要的决定它在统计学上仍然是正确的比如确实是有更多的叫做乔治的人住在佐治亚确实是牙医中叫做丹尼斯更多一些以及确实很多叫做保拉的人嫁给了保罗这些事实统计更可行（笑声）现在，我，当然，我知道这些是美国的数据我认为，好吧，是那些愚蠢的美国人的数据他们被一些自己都没有意识到的事情所影响了这是十分荒谬的然后，我看了看我的父亲和母亲—（笑声）卡罗莉娜和卡尔以及奶奶和爷爷约瑟芬和约瑟夫所以我仍在寻求一位叫做斯蒂芬妮的女孩儿我要指出
en:If you look at the statisticsand you see that the guy called George,when he decides on where he wants to live —is it Florida or North Dakota? —he goes and lives in Georgia.And if you look at a guy called Dennis,when he decides what to become —is it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctoror a teacher? —best chance is that he wants to become a dentist.And if Paula decidesshould she marry Joe or Jack,somehow Paul sounds the most interesting.And so even if we makethose very important decisionsfor very silly reasons,it remains statistically truethat there are more Georges living in Georgiaand there are more Dennises becoming dentistsand there are more Paulas who are married to Paulthan statistically viable.(Laughter)Now I, of course, thought,&quot;Well this is American data,&quot;and I thought, &quot;Well, those silly Americans.They get influenced by thingsthat they&#39;re not aware of.This is just completely ridiculous.&quot;Then, of course, I looked at my mom and my dad —(Laughter)Karolina and Karl,and grandmom and granddad,Josefine and Josef.So I am looking still for a Stephanie.I&#39;ll figure something out.

zh-cn:如果我做整个这件事情更加个人化一点并且看看作为一名设计师什么使我更快乐最简单的回单，当然就是最更多我喜欢做的事情少做我讨厌的事情—这将对了解我到底喜欢做什么有所帮助我很喜欢列清单因此我列了一个清单其中一项是不要带着压力去思考这是我们正在着手做的项目项目的期限很合理它是一个关于文化的书就像大家所看到的文化是快速变化着的做一些事情就像我现在做的—去嘎纳电影节现在这个例子是一个椅子，出现在巴厘岛的那一年明显的被当地的制作手法和文化所影响了不要被局限在电脑屏幕的后面一整天在这里或者那里具有很强意识的一个设计项目需要各种各样不同的技术本质上说反对直接简单的改编
en:If I make this whole thing a little bit more personaland see what makes me happy as a designer,the easiest answer, of course,is do more of the stuff that I like to doand much less of the stuff that I don&#39;t like to do —for which it would be helpfulto know what it is that I actually do like to do.I&#39;m a big list maker,so I came up with a list.One of them is to think without pressure.This is a project we&#39;re working on right nowwith a very healthy deadline.It&#39;s a book on culture,and, as you can see,culture is rapidly drifting around.Doing things like I&#39;m doing right now —traveling to Cannes.The example I have hereis a chair that came out of the year in Bali —clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture,not being stuck behinda single computer screen all day longand be here and there.Quite consciously, design projectsthat need an incredible amount of various techniques,just basically to fightstraightforward adaptation.

zh-cn:贴近内容本身—那就是真正贴近内心的内容这是一辆公车，或者说是一辆交通工具为一个慈善非政府组织工作他们呼吁提高美国的教育预算—很细心的设计它比立交桥低两英寸，可以顺利通过拥有最终结果—打印好的一些东西像这个小名片对于一个动画公司来说被称为透镜衬箔上的杂耍从事于有实际影响的项目就像为了已故的德国艺术家做一本书他的遗孀找到我们希望可以让他的已故的丈夫出名它是半年前创造的正在德国引起不可思议的反响还有，我觉得他的遗孀的要求将会非常成功
en:Being close to the content —that&#39;s the content really is close to my heart.This is a bus, or vehicle,for a charity, for an NGOthat wants to double the education budget in the United States —carefully designed,so, by two inches, it still clears highway overpasses.Having end results — things that come back from the printer well,like this little business card for an animation companycalled Sideshowon lenticular foils.Working on projectsthat actually have visible impacts,like a book for a deceased German artistwhose widow came to uswith the requirement to make her late husband famous.It just came out six months ago,and it&#39;s getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany.And I think that his widowis going to be very successful on her quest.

zh-cn:最近, 参与其中的项目中我大约了解其中一半技术主导的项目另一半应该是新项目因此在这种情况下因此对于新加坡来说 这是个户外的投影在这些巨大的如时代广场的屏幕上作为一个设计师，我当然了解关于印刷样式的东西虽然我和那些动物合作的不怎么成功但是我还不太清楚那些关于动作或者影像从那个观点看，我们创造了一个很好的项目当时同样因为内容非常接近这种情况下，坚持写日记帮助个人的发展我十二岁的时候开始写日记.我发现它影响了我的生活和工作通过特别奇妙的方式在这情况下, 也是因为它是我们创造的很多情绪的其中的一个部分这所有的情绪原本都来自日记之中
en:And lately, to be involved in projectswhere I know about 50 percent of the projecttechnique-wiseand the other 50 percent would be new.So in this case,it&#39;s an outside projection for Singaporeon these giant Times Square-like screens.And I of course knew stuff, as a designer,about typography,even though we worked with those animals not so successfully.But I didn&#39;t quite knowall that much about movement or film.And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project.But also because the content was very close.In this case, &quot;Keeping a DiarySupports Personal Development&quot; —I&#39;ve been keeping a diary since I was 12.And I&#39;ve found that it influenced my life and workin a very intriguing way.In this case also becauseit&#39;s part of one of the many sentimentsthat we build the whole series on —that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary.
