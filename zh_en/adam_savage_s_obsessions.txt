zh-cn:大概四年前，《纽约客》刊登了一篇文章说在毛里求斯岛上的一个矿坑里发现了许多埋藏的渡渡鸟遗骨毛里求斯岛位于印度洋在马达加斯加海岸的东边渡渡鸟在那里被发现也在那里灭绝这一过程仅仅用了150年的时间这次考古发现让每个人欢呼雀跃因为这意味着人们终于有机会组装出单只渡渡鸟的完整骨架
en:About four years ago, the New Yorker published an articleabout a cache of dodo bones that was foundin a pit on the island of Mauritius.Now, the island of Mauritius is a small islandoff the east coast of Madagascarin the Indian Ocean, and it is the placewhere the dodo bird was discoveredand extinguished, all within about 150 years.Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find,because it meant that they might finally be ableto assemble a single dodo skeleton.

zh-cn:尽管世界上有很多博物馆收藏有渡渡鸟的骨架但即使是毛里求斯岛的自然历史博物馆也没有一具骨架标本是由单只渡渡鸟遗体制成的呃，其实这么不完全准确事实上，在大英博物馆直到18世纪还收藏有一副完整的渡渡鸟标本实际上这是个保有皮肤的完整的木乃伊标本但是为了满足节省空间的热情他们竟把头和脚都切下来然后把其它的部分丢进篝火烧掉了现在如果你登陆他们的网站会看到他们列出了这些标本并说其它部分在火灾中丢失了
en:See, while museums all over the worldhave dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody —not even the actual Natural History Museumon the island of Mauritius — has a skeleton that&#39;s madefrom the bones of a single dodo.Well, this isn&#39;t exactly true.The fact is, is that the British Museumhad a complete specimen of a dodo in their collectionup until the 18th century —it was actually mummified, skin and all —but in a fit of space-saving zeal,they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feetand they burned the rest in a bonfire.If you go look at their website today,they&#39;ll actually list these specimens, saying,the rest was lost in a fire.

zh-cn:不管怎么说，跟事实很接近了文章的第一页便是这张图片我觉得蒂娜·布朗很了不起他为《纽约客》提供了许多图片而这张图片彻底震撼了我的世界我被它完全迷住了不仅仅因为美丽的图片本身还有它的颜色、薄薄的触摸感、可见的细节你能看到鸟喙上的金属线那是用来连接起整个骨架的这整个就是一个故事我自己在想如果能有个属于自己的渡渡鸟骨架该有多棒（笑）
en:Not quite the whole truth. Anyway.The frontispiece of this article was this photo,and I&#39;m one of the people that thinks that Tina Brownwas great for bringing photos to the New Yorker,because this photo completely rocked my world.I became obsessed with the object —not just the beautiful photograph itself,and the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that&#39;s visible,the wire you can see on the beak therethat the conservator used to put this skeleton together —there&#39;s an entire story here.And I thought to myself,wouldn&#39;t it be greatif I had my own dodo skeleton?(Laughter)

zh-cn:好，此刻我想指出的一点是我的整个人生都在迷恋着事物，极其背后的故事这是最近的一个所以我开始四处寻找看是否有人出售一套类似模型的给我我找到大量的参考材料和精美的图片不行，没有找到渡渡鸟骨架。但错误已经铸成在我的“创造性项目”文件夹里我已经保存了几百张渡渡鸟骨架的图片那里就像我大脑的仓库，储藏着一切我可能感兴趣的东西每一次连上互联网就有无数的东西涌了进来从漂亮的指环到驾驶室图片拉法叶为庆祝攻陷巴士底狱送给华盛顿的钥匙俄罗斯核武器的发射钥匙上面那张图片是我在eBay上找到的底下那张则是我自己制作的因为我买不起eBay上的那张纳粹的制服；中土世界的地图——我自己手绘的那就是渡渡鸟骨架的文件夹里面有17000张图片超过20G的信息容量而且还在不断增加几个星期后的某一天，或许已经过了一年了我和孩子走进艺术商店想买些黏土材料我们准备过一个手工艺日我买了一些雕塑土，一些铁线支架和其他材料看着雕塑土我忽然想到也许也许我可以自己来做个渡渡鸟头骨
en:I want to point out here at this point thatI&#39;ve spent my life obsessedby objects and the stories that they tell,and this was the very latest one.So I began looking around for —to see if anyone sold a kit,some kind of model that I could get,and I found lots of reference material, lots of lovely pictures.No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletonsinto my &quot;Creative Projects&quot; folder —it&#39;s a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.Any time I have an internet connection,there&#39;s a sluice of stuff moving into there,everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washingtonto celebrate the storming of the Bastille.Russian nuclear launch key:The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay;the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself,because I couldn&#39;t afford the one on eBay.Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth —that&#39;s one I hand-drew myself. There&#39;s the dodo skeleton folder.This folder has 17,000 photos —over 20 gigabytes of information —and it&#39;s growing constantly.And one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have beenmaybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids,and I was buying some clay tools — we were going to have a craft day.I bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought,maybe,yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.

zh-cn:我得先说一下——我并不是个雕塑家我只是一个硬边模型制作者给我一张图纸，就给了我复制的动力给我一台起重机，脚手架，不给我看《星球大战》尤其不能给我看《星球大战》然后我就能一整天鼓捣这些玩意这就是我15年来如何谋生的但如果你给我这样的东西我的朋友迈克·默南做了这个雕塑这是为《星球大战》第二部所做的初步模型这不是我要做的这是给别的人做的——龙，一些软活
en:I should point out at this time — I&#39;m not a sculptor;I&#39;m a hard-edged model maker.You give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate,you give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from &quot;Star Wars&quot; —especially parts from &quot;Star Wars&quot; —I can do this stuff all day long.It&#39;s exactly how I made my living for 15 years.But you give me something like this —my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this;it&#39;s a maquette for &quot;Star Wars, Episode Two&quot; —this is not my thing —this is something other people do — dragons, soft things.

zh-cn:但我觉得自己已经看了足够多的渡渡鸟骨架图片实际上已经能够理解它的解剖结构或许也可以复制一个了我是说，这并不是那么难我开始看能找到的最好的那些图片我搜寻所有的参考资料找到了这篇可爱的材料它是某人在eBay上出售的东西这是，明显是，很可能是一只女人的手假设它的大小和我妻子的手差不多我测量了她的拇指，然后把数据扩展到头骨大小扩展到实际尺寸之后我就开始把这些数据与其他的资料进行比较弄清楚鸟喙实际到底应该有多大实际应该有多长，等等
en:However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skullsto actually be able tounderstand the topology and perhaps replicate it —I mean, it couldn&#39;t be that difficult.So, I started looking at the best photos I could find.I grabbed all the reference,and I found this lovely piece of reference.This is someone selling this on eBay;it was clearly a woman’s hand, hopefully a woman&#39;s hand.Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife&#39;s hand,I made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that,along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to itas size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be,exactly how long, etc.
时间： 4:18
zh-cn:几小时后我终于搞清楚什么才是比较合理的渡渡鸟头骨不过我没有继续下去这有点像在清理一个超乱的房间时你只能每次收拾一件东西，你不能想到所有的一切我当时没有想到渡渡鸟骨架我只注意到自己完成了这个头骨用来固定的支架金属线从原本应该是脊柱的位置穿了出来多年来我一直感兴趣并着迷的另一种东西便是脊柱和骨架，我已经搜集了数百个实际上我已经足够了解椎骨的力学机制似乎可以模仿一下了接着我就一步一步，一块椎骨接着一块椎骨自己鼓捣了起来最后到那天结束，我已经有了个不错的头骨一个恰到好处的脊椎和半个骨盆
en:And over a few hours, I eventually achievedwhat was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn&#39;t mean to continue, I —it&#39;s kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy roomby picking up one thing at a time; you can&#39;t think about the totality.I wasn&#39;t thinking about a dodo skeleton;I just noticed that as I finished this skull,the armature wire that I had been used to holding it upwas sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.And one of the other things I&#39;d been interested in and obsessed with over the yearsis spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.I actually understood the mechanicsof vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.And so button by button,vertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.And actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull,a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.

zh-cn:我继续寻找着更多的参考资料绘画、漂亮的图片，以及一切能找到的资料我爱这个家伙！他把渡渡鸟腿骨和尺子放到了扫描器里这就是我想要的“精确”每一块我复制了每一块骨头然后放进去大概过了六个星期我安装、上漆完成了属于我自己的渡渡鸟骨架你能看到我还给它做了个博物馆标签写上有关渡渡鸟历史的简短介绍而TAP塑料公司还做了个博物馆陈列橱窗给我我没拍下来我屋里没空间摆放这个东西但我必须完成我已经开始的工作
en:And again, I kept on going, looking for more reference,every bit of reference I could find — drawings, beautiful photos.This guy — I love this guy! He put a dodo leg bones on a scannerwith a ruler.This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted,and Ireplicated every last bone and put it in.And after about six weeks,I finished, painted, mountedmy own dodo skeleton.You can see that I even made a museum label for itthat includes a brief history of the dodo.And TAP Plastics made me — although I didn&#39;t photograph it —a museum vitrine.I don&#39;t have the room for this in my house,but I had to finish what I had started.

zh-cn:实际上，这代表了我的某种彻底的转变如我所说，我的生活都是关于对事物及其背后的故事着迷还有为自己制作、获得这些东西欣赏它们，沉浸其中而在这个“创造性项目”文件夹里有许许多多我正在进行的项目有的已经有所进展，有的将在未来某一天开始着手还有一些东西我只是想找到、买到看一看，摸一摸现在还有了一类新的东西我能够雕塑的东西这很不一样我有了自己的R2D2（星球大战里的机器人）说实话对我来说，跟雕刻比起来，这简单多了
en:And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.Again, like I said, my life has been aboutbeing fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell,and also making them for myself, obtaining them,appreciating them and diving into them.And in this folder, &quot;Creative Projects,&quot;there are tons of projects that I&#39;m currently working on,projects that I&#39;ve already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day,and things that I may just want to find and buy and haveand look at and touch.But now there was potentially this new category of thingsthat I could sculptthat was different, that I — you know,I have my own R2D2, but that&#39;s —honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that&#39;s easy.

zh-cn:因此我回头仔细审视了“创造性项目”文件夹突然发现了《马耳他之鹰》很有意思我爱上了汉密特小说里的一件东西因为如果它存在，世界上的人就将分为两种类型“钱德勒”人和“汉密特”人，我绝对属于钱德勒人（钱德勒和汉密特均为美国侦探小说家）不过这里与作者无关与书或电影或故事无关只与这件物品自身有关在这里，这个物品具有许多层的意义
en:And so I went back and looked through my &quot;Creative Projects&quot; folder,and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.Now, this is funny for me:to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel,because if it&#39;s true that the world is divided into two types of people,Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.But in this case,it&#39;s not about the author, it&#39;s not about the book or the movie or the story,it&#39;s about the object in and of itself.And in this case, this object is —plays on a host of levels.
时间： 6:52
zh-cn:首先，是有这么个东西这就是“Kniphausen Hawk”一个仪式用的浇筑模型是1700年为一位瑞典伯爵所制作的它很可能就是汉密特写《马耳他之鹰》的灵感来源因此就有了汉密特为小说所创作的鸟由词汇制成驱动着书的内容，以及电影情节的发展故事中还创造了另一件东西一个代表汉密特在书中所描述物品的道具道具代表了电影中的猎鹰，其实还是受Kniphauser Hawk的启发然后就到了第四个层次世界上又一个完全崭新的物品为电影而做的这个道具凭其本身成为一个完全不一样的物品一个完全的新的欲望象征
en:First of all, there&#39;s the object in the world.This is the &quot;Kniphausen Hawk.&quot;It is a ceremonial pouring vesselmade around 1700 for a Swedish Count,and it is very likely the object from whichHammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.Built out of words, it is the enginethat drives the plot of his book and also the movie,in which another object is created:a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words,inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.And then there is this fourth level, which isa whole new object in the world:the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing,becomes, in its own right,a whole other thing,a whole new object of desire.
时间： 7:37
zh-cn:所以是时候做些研究了实际上我在几年前已经做了一部分研究所以才有个文件夹在那里我还在eBay上买了一个“马耳他之鹰”的复制品一个十分蹩脚的复制品我还下载了足够多的图片作为适当的参考但在做了更多研究后特别是需要精确参考的时候我发现一只原版的铅制雕塑1994年在克里斯蒂拍卖行被拍卖了所以我就联系了一位爱好古董的书商他有克里斯蒂拍卖行目录的原稿我从中找到了这张极好的图片还附有尺寸参照由此我便能扫描图片，将它放大到完整的尺寸
en:And so now it was time to do some research.I actually had done some researcha few years before — it&#39;s why the folder was there.I&#39;d bought a replica, a really crappy replica,of the Maltese Falcon on eBay,and had downloaded enough pictures to actuallyhave some reasonable reference.But I discovered,in researching further,really wanting precise reference, thatone of the original lead birdshad been sold at Christie&#39;s in 1994,and so I contacted an antiquarian booksellerwho had the original Christie&#39;s catalogue,and in it I found this magnificent picture,which included a size reference.I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.
时间： 8:15
zh-cn:我还找到另一个参照，来自Avi [Ara] Chekmayan新泽西的一位编辑是他于1991年在一个跳蚤市场上发现了这个树脂制的马耳他雄鹰因为争议很大他总共花了五年时间才验明这就是拍卖商说明书描述的真品它是用树脂做的这在当时并不是一种做电影道具的常见材料有意思的是，我花了好一会才鉴定它是真的当它和这一个比较我能保证，这的的确确是真的都是从一个模子里出来的这一个，因为拍卖会实际上很有争议我记得Profiles in History拍卖行1995年时为它拍出了10万美金可以从底部看到他们不仅仅提供了正面图还提供了侧面、背面和其他角度的视图
en:I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan,a New Jersey editor, actually found thisresin Maltese Falconat a flea market in 1991,although it took him five yearsto authenticate this bird tothe auctioneers&#39; specifications,because there was a lot of controversy about it.It was made out of resin, which wasn&#39;t a common material for movie propsabout the time the movie was made.It&#39;s funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it,because I can see it compared to this thing,and I can tell you — it&#39;s real, it&#39;s the real thing,it&#39;s made from the exact same mold that this one is.In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial,Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this —I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars —they actually included — you can see here on the bottom —not just a front elevation, but alsoa side, rearand other side elevation.

zh-cn:这样，我就有了所需的结构资料来复制马耳他之鹰他们怎么做的，如何开始？我一无所知所以这一次，我就跟做渡渡鸟头骨那样把参照材料放大到完整尺寸然后删去不合适的材料再利用那些模版作为形状参考接着我就用Sculpey雕塑土做了一个雏形直到我获得正确的侧面图之后我才慢慢地，一根羽毛一根羽毛地逐渐逐渐做出了想要的结果——在电视前鼓捣雕塑土这是我坐在妻子旁边这也是整个过程中我拍的唯一一张照片到最后，我终于做成了一个很不错的马耳他之鹰复制品但我仍然不是一个雕塑家
en:So now, I had all the topology I neededto replicate the Maltese Falcon.What do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don&#39;t know.So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull,I blew all my reference up to full size,and then I began cutting out the negatives and usingthose templates as shape references.So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it,and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail,I worked out and achieved —working in front of the television and Super Sculpey —here&#39;s me sitting next to my wife —it&#39;s the only picture I took of the entire process.As I moved through, I achieveda very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.But again, I am not a sculptor,

zh-cn:有好多技巧我都不知道我不知道老友Mike做的雕塑表面为何既漂亮又光彩照人我就是没办法做到所以我去到我的店里做了个模型，用树脂铸了一个因为用树脂做，我就绝对能进行玻璃光面精整有很多填充和光面精整的方法我喜欢的是用这种粗糙的黑色汽车底漆涂上大概70层我喷了三四天，油漆滴个不停不过得到的磨砂表面相当的不错我才可以对它做玻璃抛光噢，最后以000#钢丝绒收尾现在，这件非同寻常的作品就出炉了因为在电影里，当他们最后把鸟拿出来的时候他们把它放在桌上，旋转它所以我可以利用屏幕截图和停格显示来确定我按照电影里的灯光照射方式确保用同样位置的灯光照射能取得相同的反射光这就是我想达到的细节水平最后我得到了这个：我的马耳他之鹰它很漂亮。而且此时此刻我可以负责任地说当我完成这个作品时在所有的复制品——其实也很少——中它是最最精确表现马耳他之鹰原件的而原件，我可以告诉你们
en:and so I don&#39;t know a lot of the tricks, like,I don&#39;t know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey;I certainly wasn&#39;t able to get it.So, I went down to my shop,and I molded it and I cast it in resin,because in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.Now there&#39;s a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.My preference is about 70 coats of this —matte black auto primer.I spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell,but it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surfaceand I can get it glass-smooth.Oh, finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was thatbecause in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end,and they place it on the table, they actually spin it.So I was able to actuallyscreen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.And I&#39;m following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I&#39;m holding the lightin the same position, I&#39;m getting the same type of reflection on it —that&#39;s the level of detail I&#39;m going into this thing.I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.And it&#39;s beautiful. And I can state with authorityat this point in time, when I&#39;d finished it,of all of the replicas out there — and there is a few —this is by far the most accuraterepresentation of the original Maltese Falconthan anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you,

en:is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.This is where it gets weird.Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.Terrifying guy — agreed by many to be the killerof the Black Dahlia.Now, James Ellroy believesthat Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon,killed James Elroy&#39;s mother.I&#39;ll go you one stranger than that: In 1974,during the production of a weird comedy sequel to &quot;The Maltese Falcon,&quot;called &quot;The Black Bird,&quot; starring George Segal,the Los Angeles County Museum of Arthad a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon —one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie —stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thoughtit was a publicity stunt for the movie.John&#39;s Grill, which actuallyis seen briefly in &quot;The Maltese Falcon,&quot;is still a viable San Francisco eatery,counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook,who played Wilmer Cook in the movie,and he gave themone of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years,until it got stolenin January of 2007.It would seem that the object of desireonly comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly.

en:So here I had this Falcon,and it was lovely. It looked really great,the light worked on it really well,it was better than anything that I could achieveor obtain out in the world.But there was a problem. And the problem was that:I wanted the entirety of the object,I wanted the weight behind the object.This thing was made of resin and it was too light.There&#39;s this group online that I frequent.It&#39;s a group of prop crazies just like mecalled the Replica Props Forum, and it&#39;s people who trade,make and travel in information about movie props.And it turned out that one of the guys there,a friend of mine that I never actually met,but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.He took my master Falcon pattern,he actually did lost wax castingin bronze for me,and this is the bronze I got back.And this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with.

There&#39;s my first casting,there&#39;s my master and there&#39;s my bronze.There&#39;s a thing that happens when you mold and cast things,which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin,you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one,it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.Yeah, no, really, this was like aah —why didn&#39;t I remember this?Why didn&#39;t I start and make it bigger?So what do I do? I figure I have two options.One, I can fire a freaking laser at it,which I have already done,to do a 3D scan — there&#39;s a 3D scan of this Falcon.I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achievedgoing from a wax master to a bronze masterand blown this up big enough to makea 3D lithography master of this,which I will polish, then I will send to the mold makerand then I will have it done in bronze.
