zh-cn:就是这个地方那时我还年轻我的音乐首演就是在这里特别强调一下，这是一个声音效果非常棒的房间墙面凹凸不平，到处都是垃圾它的音效实际上却非常不错这首歌就是在那里录制的（音乐）不过照片里的还不是传声头像（著名摇滚乐队）（音乐：&quot;A Clean Break (Let&#39;s Work)&quot; 传声头像）这房间的结构让吐字变得易于理解歌词很容易听清音响系统相当不错房间里的混响也不太大因此旋律保存得相当完好相当凝练国内还有很多地方有这样的房间这是纳什维尔的Tootsie&#39;s Orchid Lounge这里的音乐有些不同但结构和形式却很相似客人的行为习惯也很类似因此在Tootsie&#39;s和CBGB（纽约传奇摇滚音乐俱乐部）里表演的乐队都必须演奏得非常大声——音量要大得足以压过人们跌倒、大吼大叫或者发出的其他声音
en:This is the venuewhere, as a young man,some of the music that I wrote was first performed.It was, remarkably,a pretty good sounding room.With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere,it actually sounded pretty good.This is a song that was recorded there.(Music)This is not Talking Heads,in the picture anyway.(Music: &quot;A Clean Break (Let&#39;s Work)&quot; by Talking Heads)So the nature of the roommeant that words could be understood.The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.The sound system was kind of decent.And there wasn&#39;t a lot of reverberation in the room.So the rhythmscould be pretty intact too,pretty concise.Other places around the country had similar rooms.This is Tootsie&#39;s Orchid Lounge in Nashville.The music was in some ways different,but in structure and form,very much the same.The clientele behavior was very much the same too.And so the bands at Tootsie&#39;sor at CBGB&#39;shad to play loud enough —the volume had to be loud enough to overcomepeople falling down, shouting outand doing whatever else they were doing.

zh-cn:在那以后，我还在其他更高级的场所表演过我在这里的迪斯尼音乐厅或是卡内基音乐厅之类的地方演奏过都是激动人心的经历但我也发现，有时候我之前或是当时谱写的歌曲在其中的一些音乐厅表现得并不理想我们尽量做了调整但有些时候，那些地方和我创作的音乐就是显得不太协调我问自己我是不是在为着什么特定的场所进行创作呢？在我创作时，脑海中是不是有一个地点、一个场所呢？这算不算是一种创作模式呢？我们创作时是不是脑海中都有着某个场所、某个情境？
en:Since then, I&#39;ve played other placesthat are much nicer.I&#39;ve played the Disney Hall hereand Carnegie Hall and places like that.And it&#39;s been very exciting.But I also noticed that sometimes the musicthat I had written,or was writing at the time,didn&#39;t sound all that greatin some of those halls.We managed,but sometimes those halls didn&#39;t seem exactly suitedto the music I was makingor had made.So I asked myself:Do I write stufffor specific rooms?Do I have a place, a venue,in mind when I write?Is that a kind of model for creativity?Do we all make things witha venue, a context, in mind?

zh-cn:好了，这是非洲（音乐： &quot;Wenlenga&quot; / 多名艺术家)当今我们所知的大部分流行音乐有很大一部分是源于西非的而这里的音乐要我说，这乐器这复杂的节奏演奏的方式，背景，情境一切都很完美，协调得天衣无缝在那种背景下，这样的音乐是完美的没有大房间制造混响，干扰节奏乐器的声音也够大即使没有功放之类的设备也能听得一清二楚这不是偶然的这音乐只在特定情境下才表现得如此完美如果改成这样的场所那就会一团糟。这是一座哥特式大教堂（音乐：&quot;Spem In Alium&quot; 托马斯·塔利斯）在哥特式大教堂，这类的音乐才是完美的不改变音调，音符拖得很长基本上没有节奏而这个房间则为音乐锦上添花实际上，它提升了音乐这里是巴赫为其创作乐曲的地方。这是管风琴这里并没有哥特式大教堂那么大所以他可以创作更繁复的作品他可以标新立异改变调子而不会发生不协和和音（音乐：&quot;Fantasia On Jesu, Mein Freunde&quot; 约翰·S·巴赫）
en:Okay, Africa.(Music: &quot;Wenlenga&quot; / Various artists)Most of the popular music that we know nowhas a big part of its roots in West Africa.And the music there,I would say, the instruments,the intricate rhythms,the way it&#39;s played, the setting, the context,it&#39;s all perfect. It all works perfect.The music works perfectly in that setting.There&#39;s no big roomto create reverberation and confuse the rhythms.The instruments are loud enoughthat they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.It&#39;s no accident.It&#39;s perfect for that particular context.And it would be a messin a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.(Music: &quot;Spem In Alium&quot; by Thomas Tallis)In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.It doesn&#39;t change key, the notes are long,there&#39;s almost no rhythm whatsoever,and the room flatters the music.It actually improves it.This is the room that Bachwrote some of his music for. This is the organ.It&#39;s not as big as a gothic cathedral,so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate.He can, very innovatively,actually change keyswithout risking huge dissonances.(Music: &quot;Fantasia On Jesu, Mein Freunde&quot; by Johann S. Bach)

zh-cn:这是晚些时候类似莫扎特创作时所在的房间我想大概是1770年左右的建筑它们空间更小，混响也更小所以他能作出可谓华丽的曲子他的音乐非常繁复——而且效果甚佳（音乐：&quot;F小调奏鸣曲&quot; 乌夫冈·A·莫扎特）它完美地契合了这个房间这是斯卡啦剧院（位于意大利米兰）它和之前的那个房间差不多建造于同一时期我想大概建于1776年在歌剧院建成的时期里面的听众常常互相嚷嚷他们经常一边大吃大喝，一边和舞台上的人大喊大叫就像CBGB这类场所的观众一样如果他们喜欢其中一段咏叹调会大喊着建议这一段再演一次不是在演出最后再演一次，而是马上重演（笑声）嗯，那就是看歌剧的经验之谈这是瓦格纳自己建造的歌剧院剧院的规模不是很大比这里要小但是瓦格纳进行了革新他想要一支更大的乐队多一点浮华的感觉于是他增加了乐池的面积这样就可以容纳更多的低音乐器（音乐：&quot;罗恩格林/第三幕序曲&quot; 理查德·瓦格纳）
en:This is a little bit later.This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.I think we&#39;re in like 1770, somewhere around there.They&#39;re smaller, even less reverberant,so he can write really frilly musicthat&#39;s very intricate — and it works.(Music: &quot;Sonata in F,&quot; KV 13, by Wolfgang A. Mozart)It fits the room perfectly.This is La Scala.It&#39;s around the same time,I think it was built around 1776.People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built,they used to yell out to one another.They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage,just like they do at CBGB&#39;s and places like that.If they liked an aria,they would holler and suggestthat it be done again as an encore,not at the end of the show, but immediately.(Laughter)And well, that was an opera experience.This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.And the size of the room is not that big.It&#39;s smaller than this.But Wagner made an innovation.He wanted a bigger band.He wanted a little more bombast,so he increased the size of the orchestra pitso he could get more low-end instruments in there.(Music: &quot;Lohengrin / Prelude to Act III&quot; by Richard Wagner)

zh-cn:好了这是卡内基音乐厅这类的建筑显然已经流行起来音乐厅规模更大。卡内基音乐厅的大小和集市差不多比一些交响乐厅还大那里的混响比斯卡拉剧院的更大与此同时根据Alex Ross给《纽约客》所写的文章可以看出这样的规则孕育而生：观众必须保持安静在演出的过程中，不能再吃吃喝喝向舞台上大喊大叫或者和别人交头接耳他们必须非常安静结合这两件事来看有一种不同类型的音乐在这样的音乐厅中效果最好它可以气势磅礴这是之前某些种类的音乐所不具有的安静的部分也听得到虽然很容易被悄悄话和叫喊声淹没但由于混响的关系在卡内基音乐厅之类的地方音乐的节奏得稍微降低质地却稍微提高（音乐：“降E大调第八交响曲” 古斯塔夫·马勒）这是马勒虽然看上去像鲍勃·迪伦，但这确实是马勒哈，这是鲍勃的最后一张唱片
en:Okay.This is Carnegie Hall.Obviously, this kind of thing became popular.The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall&#39;s fair-sized.It&#39;s larger than some of the other symphony halls.And they&#39;re a lot more reverberantthan La Scala.Around the same,according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker,this kind of rule came into effectthat audiences had to be quiet —no more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage,or gossiping with one anotherduring the show.They had to be very quiet.So those two things combined meant thata different kind of musicworked best in these kind of halls.It meant that there could be extreme dynamics,which there weren&#39;t in some of theseother kinds of music.Quiet parts could be heardthat would have been drowned outby all the gossiping and shouting.But because of the reverberationin those rooms like Carnegie Hall,the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmicand a little more textural.(Music: &quot;Symphony No. 8 in E Flat Major&quot; by Gustav Mahler)This is Mahler.It looks like Bob Dylan, but it&#39;s Mahler.That was Bob&#39;s last record, yeah.

zh-cn:流行音乐同时也诞生了这是一支爵士乐队据斯科特·乔普林所说，这支乐队曾经在游船和夜总会中表演过这一次的环境又很嘈杂。他们为跳舞的人伴奏有些段落舞者特别喜欢——一首歌中有好几个段落他们会说：“把那部分再演奏一次。”有很多时候为了满足舞者，你会一次又一次地演奏同一个段落因此，乐队开始即兴创作新的曲子一种音乐的新类型诞生了（音乐：&quot;皇家花园蓝调&quot; W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters）爵士乐主要在空间较小的室内演奏人们跳舞、叫喊、畅饮所以，音乐的声音必须够大盖过别的声音有些事情成真了。——那是在这个世纪之初对整个20世纪的流行音乐来说无论是摇滚还是拉丁音乐对音乐的改变都不是很大
en:Popular music, coming along at the same time.This is a jazz band.According to Scott Joplin, the bands were playingon riverboats and clubs.Again, it&#39;s noisy. They&#39;re playing for dancers.There&#39;s certain sections of the song — the songs had different sectionsthat the dancers really liked.And they&#39;d say, &quot;Play that part again.&quot;Well, there&#39;s only so many timesyou can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.So the bands started to improvise new melodies.And a new form of music was born.(Music: &quot;Royal Garden Blues&quot; by W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters)These are played mainly in small rooms.People are dancing, shouting and drinking.So the music has to be loud enoughto be heard above that.Same thing goes true for — that&#39;s the beginning of the century —for the whole of 20th-century popular music,whether it&#39;s rock or Latin music or whatever.[Live music] doesn&#39;t really change that much.

zh-cn:但当它成为音乐的主要媒介之一后在20世纪的前30年间流行音乐就发生了很大改变而这是音乐传播到那里的方法之一麦克风完全改变了音乐家、作曲家特别是歌手创作的作品迄今为止，收音机上大多播放的都是现场演奏但有些歌手，比如法兰克·辛纳屈（Frank Sinatra）可以用麦克风制造一些不用麦克风根本无法达到的效果在他之后，更有一些歌手把这种做法发扬光大（音乐：&quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; Chet Baker）这是Chet Baker（著名爵士乐手）这种效果没有麦克风绝对做不出来如果没有录成唱片，那也无法达到他就在你的耳畔歌唱在你的耳畔低语这种效果就像过了电一样仿佛歌手就坐在你的身边和你说着什么东西
en:It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century,when this becameone of the primary venues for music.And this was one waythat the music got there.Microphones enabled singers, in particular,and musicians and composers,to completely change the kind of musicthat they were writing.So far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music,but singers, like Frank Sinatra,could use the micand do thingsthat they could never do without a microphone.Other singers after himwent even further.(Music: &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; by Chet Baker)This is Chet Baker.And this kind of thingwould have been impossible without a microphone.It would have been impossible without recorded music as well.And he&#39;s singing right into your ear.He&#39;s whispering into your ears.The effect is just electric.It&#39;s like the guy is sitting next to you,whispering who knows what into your ear.

zh-cn:从那个时候起，音乐开始分化既有现场音乐也有唱片音乐它们不再完全相同现在还有迪斯科舞厅这样的地方在酒吧里也有自动点唱机这些地方就不需要乐队了不需要那些现场乐队之类的角色那里的音响不错人们开始专门为迪斯科和这些音响创作音乐此外，和爵士一样跳舞的人会特别喜欢其中一些片段所以早期的嘻哈歌手会来回重复某些段落（音乐：&quot;Rapper&#39;s Delight&quot; The Sugarhill Gang）歌手会即兴创作歌词就像爵士演奏者会即兴创作曲子一样此外，还诞生了新的音乐模式
en:So at this point, music diverged.There&#39;s live music,and there&#39;s recorded music.And they no longer have to be exactly the same.Now there&#39;s venues like this, a discotheque,and there&#39;s jukeboxes in bars,where you don&#39;t even need to have a band.There doesn&#39;t need to be anylive performing musicians whatsoever,and the sound systems are good.People began to make musicspecifically for discosand for those sound systems.And, as with jazz,the dancers liked certain sectionsmore than they did others.So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections.(Music: &quot;Rapper&#39;s Delight&quot; by The Sugarhill Gang)The MC would improvise lyricsin the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies.And another new form of music was born.

zh-cn:现场演出，它取得了空前的成功而它诞生的场所从音响效果上来看这恐怕是世界上最不适合听音乐的地方了体育场篮球场，还有冰球场音乐家们尽了最大努力他们创作了“舞台摇滚”（arena rock）听起来像是中速的谣曲（音乐：&quot;I Still Haven&#39;t Found What I&#39;m Looking For&quot; U2）他们已经尽了全力写出了这样的歌曲节拍不快不慢，听起来很浑厚比起音乐场所那里更像是一个社交场所在某些方面他们为那里创作的音乐非常契合
en:Live performance, when it was incredibly successful,ended up in what is probably, acoustically,the worst sounding venues on the planet:sports stadiums,basketball arenas and hockey arenas.Musicians who ended up there did the best they could.They wrote what is now called arena rock,which is medium-speed ballads.(Music: &quot;I Still Haven&#39;t Found What I&#39;m Looking For&quot; by U2)They did the best they couldgiven that this is what they&#39;re writing for.The tempos are medium. It sounds big.It&#39;s more a social situationthan a musical situation.And in some ways, the musicthat they&#39;re writing for this placeworks perfectly.

zh-cn:那么，还有更多新的环境其中一个是汽车我是在汽车中的收音机边长大的但如今它进化了整辆汽车变成了一个环境（音乐：&quot;Who U Wit&quot; Lil&#39; Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz）这种音乐，让我说，是写给汽车音响系统的完美地匹配了这个环境这也许不是你想在家里听的音乐但在车子里听起来却很棒——频谱很宽重低音，发烧天碟，你懂的人声一般集中在中频我们可以和朋友一起享受汽车音乐
en:So there&#39;s more new venues.One of the new ones is the automobile.I grew up with a radio in a car.But now that&#39;s evolved into something else.The car is a whole venue.(Music: &quot;Who U Wit&quot; by Lil&#39; Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz)The music that, I would say, is writtenfor automobile sound systemsworks perfectly on it.It might not be what you want to listen to at home,but it works great in the car —has a huge frequency spectrum,you know, big bass and high-endand the voice kind of stuck in the middle.Automobile music, you can share with your friends.

zh-cn:还有另一种新的环境私人MP3播放器这一个大概只用来听基督教音乐吧（笑声）在某个方面，这和卡内基音乐厅有点像听音乐的人必须安静因为你能听到所有的细节在别的方面，它又更像西非音乐因为如果MP3播放器里的音乐太过于安静你把音量调高了，而下一秒钟你的耳朵会被另一段嘈杂的音乐震聋所以这并不很好用我想，当前创作的大多数流行音乐可以说是写给这类播放器这种个人体验的你能听出细枝末节又不怎么改变音乐的本质
en:There&#39;s one other kind of new venue,the private MP3 player.Presumably, this is just for Christian music.(Laughter)And in some ways it&#39;s like Carnegie Hall,or when the audience had to hush up,because you can now hear every single detail.In other ways, it&#39;s more like the West African musicbecause if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet,you turn it up, and the next minute,your ears are blasted out by a louder passage.So that doesn&#39;t really work.I think pop music, mainly,it&#39;s written today,to some extent, is written for these kind of players,for this kind of personal experiencewhere you can hear extreme detail,but the dynamic doesn&#39;t change that much.

zh-cn:我自问好了，这是不是一种创作的模式呢？我们是不是在适应环境呢？这又是不是放之四海而皆准呢？根据大卫·爱登堡（David Attenborough，著名生物纪录片主持人）和其他人所说鸟儿们也是这么做的树冠上的鸟在树枝浓密的地方它们的叫声通常调子更高，急促，反复而地面上的鸟叫声通常调子更低这样当它们在森林的地面上蹦蹦跳跳时声音也不会被扰乱像这只草原雀（Savannah sparrow）它们的叫声更接近嘤嘤作响（声音片段：草原雀之歌）的类型事实证明这样的声音能最有效、实用地利用体内能量传播它们的叫声穿越田野和草原其他的鸟，像这只唐纳雀（tananger）是同一鸟种中适应环境后的种类唐纳雀生活在美国东海岸那里的森林更茂盛一些它们的叫声是这样的而这一只唐纳雀则生活在对面，西边（声音片段：猩红唐纳雀之歌）它有着另一种叫声（声音片段：猩红唐纳雀之歌）因此，鸟儿也一样这么做
en:So I asked myself:Okay, is thisa model for creation,this adaptation that we do?And does it happen anywhere else?Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people,birds do it too —that the birds in the canopy,where the foliage is dense,their calls tend to behigh-pitched, short and repetitive.And the birds on the floortend to have lower pitched calls,so that they don&#39;t get distortedwhen they bounce off the forest floor.And birds like this Savannah sparrow,they tend to have a buzzing(Sound clip: Savannah sparrow song)type call.And it turns out thata sound like thisis the most energy efficient and practical wayto transmit their callacross the fields and savannahs.Other birds, like this tanager,have adapted within the same species.The tananger on the East Coast of the United States,where the forests are a little denser,has one kind of call,and the tananger on the other side, on the west(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)has a different kind of call.(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)So birds do it too.

zh-cn:然后我想好吧，如果这是一种创作模式如果我们创作音乐时主要得符合情境至少在形式上如此如果我们根据画廊或者博物馆的墙壁来绘制作品如果我们根据现有的操作系统来编写软件这就是事情进行的方式吗？对，我想这是一种进化一种适应能力但乐趣、激情和愉悦仍然存在这是和传统的浪漫情怀正好相反的观点在浪漫的观点看来首先有激情然后才有洋溢的感情接着，它再被塑造成不同的东西我要说的确，激情不可或缺但容器那即将被填满、充实的容器在最初就根据直觉已经创造出来了我们之前就知道激情会走向何方然而，这两个观点冲突的地方有一点挺有趣
en:And I thought:Well, if this is a model for creation,if we make music,primarily the form at least,to fit these contexts,and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls,and if we write software to fit existing operating systems,is that how it works?Yeah. I think it&#39;s evolutionary.It&#39;s adaptive.But the pleasure and the passion and the joyis still there.This is a reverse view of thingsfrom the kind of traditional Romantic view.The Romantic view is thatfirst comes the passionand then the outpouring of emotion,and then somehow it gets shaped into something.And I&#39;m saying,well, the passion&#39;s still there,but the vesselthat it&#39;s going to be injected into and poured into,that is instinctively and intuitivelycreated first.We already know where that passion is going.But this conflict of views is kind of interesting.

zh-cn:一名作家托马斯·弗兰克曾说也许有一种解释可以说明为什么有些选民给自己利益的对立面投了一票这些选民和我们的大多数人一样假设，如果他们觉得某一方听起来很真诚发自内心，激情洋溢那一方就是更可靠的他们会投上一票所以，如果有人假装真诚假装富有激情靠着这种方法，当然有一点风险但他们就有更大的机会被选上我要说，激情和快乐并不是势不两立的
en:The writer,Thomas Frank,says thatthis might be a kind of explanationwhy some voters voteagainst their best interests,that voters, like a lot of us,assume, that if they hear something that sounds like it&#39;s sincere,that it&#39;s coming from the gut, that it&#39;s passionate,that it&#39;s more authentic.And they&#39;ll vote for that.So that, if somebody can fake sincerity,if they can fake passion,they stand a better chanceof being selected in that way,which seems a little dangerous.I&#39;m saying the two, the passion, the joy,are not mutually exclusive.
