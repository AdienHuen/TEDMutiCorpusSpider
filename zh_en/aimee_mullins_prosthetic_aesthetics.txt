zh-cn:我曾经和一群大约300人的六到八岁的孩子们在儿童博物馆交谈我随身带着一个装满义肢的包和你们在这里所看到的相像然后我把它们摆在一个桌子上，给孩子们看从我的经验来看，要知道，孩子们天生对他们不知道、不明白或者不熟悉的东西好奇。只有在成年人的影响下他们才会学会去害怕与生俱来的好奇心就这样被抹杀或者是约束孩子们问问题好让他们做有礼貌的好孩子想象一下，大厅里一个一年级老师带着一群不守规矩的孩子，老师会说：”好啦，不管你干什么，就是别盯着她的腿看。“
en:I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,ages six to eight, at a children&#39;s museum,and I brought with me a bag full of legs,similar to the kinds of things you see up here,and had them laid out on a table for the kids.And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curiousabout what they don&#39;t know, or don&#39;t understand,or is foreign to them.They only learn to be frightened of those differenceswhen an adult influences them to behave that way,and maybe censors that natural curiosity,or you know, reins in the question-askingin the hopes of them being polite little kids.So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobbywith these unruly kids, saying, &quot;Now, whatever you do,don&#39;t stare at her legs.&quot;

zh-cn:但是，问题就在这儿我之所以会在那儿，就是想让孩子们观察和探索所以我就和成年人达成了协议让孩子们在们有成人陪伴下自己待两分钟门打开后，孩子们俯身摆弄起义肢他们这儿戳戳那儿碰碰，摇摇脚趾头还试着把整个身体压在短跑义肢上看看会有什么反应我说道：”孩子们，抓紧啊—我早上起来，一心想要能够一下子跳过比房子没什么大不了的，不过两三层的高度但是，想想哪些动物、哪些超级英雄、那些卡通人物你能想到的任何一个你会给我造一副什么样的腿呢？“
en:But, of course, that&#39;s the point.That&#39;s why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.So I made a deal with the adultsthat the kids could come in without any adults for two minuteson their own.The doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,and they are poking and prodding, and they&#39;re wiggling toes,and they&#39;re trying to put their full weight on the sprinting legto see what happens with that.And I said, &quot;Kids, really quickly —I woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house —nothing too big, two or three stories —but, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,anything you can dream up right now,what kind of legs would you build me?&quot;

zh-cn:立即有孩子答道：“袋鼠！”“不对，不对！应该是青蛙！”“不对，应该是神探佳杰特（上世纪80年代动画人物）！”“不对，不对，都不对！应该是超人特工队（迪斯尼2004年出品动画电影）”还有其他一些我不太熟悉的然后，一个8岁的孩子说道，“嗨，为什么你不想飞呢？”所有在场的人，包括我，惊叹道“对啊”（笑）就这样，我从女人一个这些孩子被教育成看待的“残疾人”到一个一个潜能尚待开发的人一个很有可能有超人能力的人很有趣吧
en:And immediately a voice shouted, &quot;Kangaroo!&quot;&quot;No, no, no! Should be a frog!&quot;&quot;No. It should be Go Go Gadget!&quot;&quot;No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles.&quot;And other things that I don&#39;t — aren&#39;t familiar with.And then, one eight-year-old said,&quot;Hey, why wouldn&#39;t you want to fly too?&quot;And the whole room, including me, was like, &quot;Yeah.&quot;(Laughter)And just like that, I went from being a womanthat these kids would have been trained to see as &quot;disabled&quot;to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn&#39;t have yet.Somebody that might even be super-abled.Interesting.

zh-cn:在座的有些人11年前在TED见过我当时人们热烈讨论这个会议是如何如何改变人生不管你是听众还是发言人，我也不例外TED可以说是我接后10年探索的发射台当时，我展示的义肢是修复术的前沿技术我当时接上了碳纤维制成的仿猎豹后肢的短跑义肢可能你们昨天见过这些栩栩如生的喷漆硅胶义肢
en:So some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.And there&#39;s been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference isfor both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life&#39;s exploration.At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legsmodeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,which you may have seen on stage yesterday.And also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs.

zh-cn:当时，我有机会在传统医学修复领域创新把他们的才智与科学、艺术相结合制造义肢这样我们就不必把外观、功能和美学划分开来并赋予不同的价值幸运的是，很多人做出了响应旅程就这样开始了，很有趣的是，有一个TED参会者琪 皮尔曼，希望她今天也在场她当时是一本名为《ID》的杂志的编辑她把我作为封面故事刊登在杂志上
en:So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call outto innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic communityto come bring their talent to the science and to the artof building legs.So that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,and assigning them different values.Well, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.And the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee —Chee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.She was the editor then of a magazine called ID,and she gave me a cover story.

zh-cn:接下来我开始了一场奇妙的旅程当时我奇妙地碰到了很多人和事我被邀请去做了很多演讲在世界各地讨论仿猎豹义肢技术人们在演讲后找到我不论男女谈话内容不外乎“要知道艾美，你很迷人。一点不像有残疾的。”（笑）我想“这还挺神的，因为我一点也不感到残疾。”我的有关演讲的视野也被打开了美也可以被探索一个美丽的女人应该长什么样？什么是性感的身体？很有趣的是，从一个身份角度残疾意味着什么？我是说，有人—比如帕米拉·安德森（美国艳星，以其硕大的隆胸著称）的修复程度可大大高过我可没人说她残疾（笑）
en:This started an incredible journey.Curious encounters were happening to me at the time;I&#39;d been accepting numerous invitations to speakon the design of the cheetah legs around the world.And people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,men and women.And the conversation would go something like this,&quot;You know Aimee, you&#39;re very attractive.You don&#39;t look disabled.&quot;(Laughter)I thought, &quot;Well, that&#39;s amazing,because I don&#39;t feel disabled.&quot;And it really opened my eyes to this conversationthat could be explored, about beauty.What does a beautiful woman have to look like?What is a sexy body?And interestingly, from an identity standpoint,what does it mean to have a disability?I mean, people — Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.Nobody calls her disabled.(Laughter)

zh-cn:后来这期《ID》杂志，经美术设计师皮特·萨维耶之手传到了时装设计师亚历山大·麦昆和摄影师尼克·奈特手中他们也对探索相关方面很感兴趣参加完TED几个月后，我就搭上了前往伦敦的航班，摄制我的第一组时尚杂志照片结果可以从这本杂志封面看出—时尚吗？3个月后，我为亚历山大·麦昆做了第一场时装秀腿着一副硬木手工义肢没人知道—大家都以为是木制长靴事实上，它们就在台上葡萄藤、木兰花，惊人的美诗意很重要诗歌能把陈腐和受忽视的东西提升到高层次进入艺术的境界能把令人生畏的东西转化成引人入胜的东西让人驻足良久也许会让人们理解
en:So this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville,went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,who were also interested in exploring that conversation.So, three months after TED I found myself on a planeto London, doing my first fashion shoot,which resulted in this cover —&quot;Fashion-able&quot;?Three months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueenon a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.Nobody knew — everyone thought they were wooden boots.Actually, I have them on stage with me:grapevines, magnolias — truly stunning.Poetry matters.Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected objectto a realm of art.It can transform the thing that might have made people fearfulinto something that invites them to look,and look a little longer,and maybe even understand.

zh-cn:这些是我从我的下一个冒险中第一手学到的艺术家马修·巴尼在他的影片《悬丝》这部影片真是醍醐灌顶我的双腿竟可以成为雕塑品这时，我就游离开模仿人体开始探索美学的理想后来我们研制了人们昵称为玻璃腿的义肢虽然它们实际上是剔透的聚亚安酯制作的也就是制造保龄球的材料相当重的！后来我们用根与土壤的东西塑造这种义肢把土豆根系植于其中，把甜菜根植在上头还装上了很可爱的铜质脚趾就这样完成了一个杰作另一个造型是半人半兽是对我运动员生涯的小小致敬14个小时的义肢彩绘才看起来像有灵活爪子、摇来摇去的尾巴的生物有点像壁虎（笑）另一付我们合作创作的义肢看起来有那么一点像水母同样也是聚亚安酯制成的这副义肢唯一的用途就是除了电影里的展示，就是给人们感官刺激并激发人们的想象所以诡谲多变很重要
en:I learned this firsthand with my next adventure.The artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the &quot;The Cremaster Cycle.&quot;This is where it really hit home for me —that my legs could be wearable sculpture.And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-nessas the only aesthetic ideal.So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legseven though they&#39;re actually optically clear polyurethane,a.k.a. bowling ball material.Heavy!Then we made these legs that are cast in soilwith a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,and a very lovely brass toe.That&#39;s a good close-up of that one.Then another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah —a little homage to my life as an athlete.14 hours of prosthetic make-upto get into a creature that had articulated paws,claws and a tail that whipped around,like a gecko.(Laughter)And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these —look like jellyfish legs,also polyurethane.And the only purpose that these legs can serve,outside the context of the film,is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.So whimsy matters.

zh-cn:今天，我带了至少12副义肢它们是由不同的人为我制作的不同的义肢给了我与我脚下大地的不同体验我还可以改变身高我有5个不同的身高（笑）今天，我有6尺1（约186cm）我身上这副义肢大概是一年前做的在英国的多西特整形外科做的当我把它们带回曼哈顿的家里我回来后第一次出来是去一个化妆舞会舞会上有个姑娘我认识多年了不过那时我只有5尺8（约177cm）她看到我惊讶不已她说道“你怎么那么高！”我说道“是啊，挺好玩的，不是吗？”有点像站在高跷上踩高跷但我从此对门框有了全新体验始料未及的新天地我乐在其中她看着我说道：“但是，艾美，这可不公平。”（笑）（鼓掌）最奇妙的是她是认真的能随意改变身高可不公平
en:Today, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legsthat various people have made for me,and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,and I can change my height —I have a variable of five different heights.(Laughter)Today, I&#39;m 6&#39;1&quot;.And I had these legs made a little over a year agoat Dorset Orthopedic in Englandand when I brought them home to Manhattan,my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.And a girl was there who has known me for yearsat my normal 5&#39;8&quot;.Her mouth dropped open when she saw me,and she went, &quot;But you&#39;re so tall!&quot;And I said, &quot;I know. Isn&#39;t it fun?&quot;I mean, it&#39;s a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,but I have an entirely new relationship to door jamsthat I never expected I would ever have.And I was having fun with it.And she looked at me,and she said, &quot;But, Aimee, that&#39;s not fair.&quot;(Laughter)(Applause)And the incredible thing was she really meant it.It&#39;s not fair that you can change your height,as you want it.

zh-cn:那时我才知道—那时我才知道社会交往的巨大变革在近10年来这不再是克服先天障碍是关于增量是关于潜能义肢的作用不再仅局限于代替身体缺失部分它们可以作为佩戴者身份的象征可以创造佩戴者天马行空的想象在这个空间所以那些社会一度认为是残障的人可以成为自己塑造身份的建筑师并且切实继续改变身份仅凭设计自己的身体从一个强大的源泉获取灵感现在令我激动不已的是通过尖端科技机器人技术、仿生学—及由来已久的诗意我们向自身的集体人性迈进了一步我认为要发掘自身人性的的潜质我们要赞美那些令人心碎的力量那些人人都有的光荣的残障我认为莎士比亚笔下的夏洛克“你们要是用刀剑刺我们，我们不是也会出血的吗？你们要是搔我们的痒，我们不是也会笑起来的吗？”这就是我们的人性及其所有的潜质是这些让我们熠熠生辉谢谢（鼓掌）
en:And that&#39;s when I knew —that&#39;s when I knew that the conversation with societyhas changed profoundlyin this last decade.It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.It&#39;s a conversation about augmentation.It&#39;s a conversation about potential.A prosthetic limb doesn&#39;t represent the need to replace loss anymore.It can stand as a symbol that the wearerhas the power to create whatever it is that they want to createin that space.So people that society once considered to be disabledcan now become the architects of their own identitiesand indeed continue to change those identitiesby designing their bodiesfrom a place of empowerment.And what is exciting to me so much right nowis that by combining cutting-edge technology —robotics, bionics —with the age-old poetry,we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.I think that if we want to discover the full potentialin our humanity,we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengthsand those glorious disabilities that we all have.I think of Shakespeare&#39;s Shylock:&quot;If you prick us, do we not bleed,and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?&quot;It is our humanity,and all the potential within it,that makes us beautiful.Thank you.(Applause)
