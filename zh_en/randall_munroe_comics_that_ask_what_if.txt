zh-cn:我的网站有个功能每周人们提出他们的假设问题让我解答我试图用数学 科学还有漫画方式来回答这些问题
en:So, I have a feature on my website where every weekpeople submit hypothetical questionsfor me to answer,and I try to answer them using math, scienceand comics.

zh-cn:比如 有人问道如果你试着击打一个以90%的光速投出的棒球会怎么样？于是我做了一些计算通常来说 当一个物体在空中飞过空气会环绕在物体周围但在这个例子里 球飞得太快了所以空气分子来不及避开物体球体会直接撞击并穿过它们和空气分子的这种相撞会将球体上的氮原子碳原子和氢原子击走把棒球变成极小的粒子而且会激发球体周围空气发生热核聚变波那会导致大量X射线随着外来粒子变成一个气泡扩散开里面是等离子体 聚集在投手区这些射线将会以比球还稍微快的速度远离投手区这些事大约发生在30纳秒本垒就离得太远光还没有来得及接触它这就意味着棒球击手仍然看见投球手准备抛球还不知道事情很不对劲（笑声）现在 在70纳秒以后球会达到本垒或至少是曾经是球的等离子体会把球棒 棒球击手本垒 捕球手以及裁判吞没然后他们开始全部分解同时球会承载着这些分解物穿过挡球网 它同时也在开始分解那么当你从山坡上观看这整个过程时最好是离得远远的你会看见一道明亮的闪光几秒钟钟后消失了接着是一片冲击波扩散出来粉碎了树木和房屋当它从球场离开的时候最终是一片蘑菇云在一片毁坏的城市上空升起（笑声）
en:So for example, one person asked,what would happen if you tried to hit a baseballpitched at 90 percent of the speed of light?So I did some calculations.Now, normally, when an object flies through the air,the air will flow around the object,but in this case, the ball would be going so fastthat the air molecules wouldn&#39;t have timeto move out of the way.The ball would smash right into and through them,and the collisions with these air moleculeswould knock away the nitrogen,carbon and hydrogen from the ball,fragmenting it off into tiny particles,and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusionin the air around it.This would result in a flood of x-raysthat would spread out in a bubblealong with exotic particles,plasma inside, centered on the pitcher&#39;s mound,and that would move away from the pitcher&#39;s moundslightly faster than the ball.Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,the home plate is far enough awaythat light hasn&#39;t had time to reach it,which means the batterstill sees the pitcher about to throwand has no idea that anything is wrong.(Laughter)Now, after 70 nanoseconds,the ball will reach home plate,or at least the cloud of expanding plasmathat used to be the ball,and it will engulf the bat and the batterand the plate and the catcher and the umpireand start disintegrating them allas it also starts to carry them backwardthrough the backstop, whichalso starts to disintegrate.So if you were watching this whole thingfrom a hill,ideally, far away,what you&#39;d see is a bright flash of lightthat would fade over a few seconds,followed by a blast wave spreading out,shredding trees and housesas it moves away from the stadium,and then eventually a mushroom cloudrising up over the ruined city. (Laughter)

zh-cn:所以 棒球联盟的规则有点儿模糊但是针对规则6.02 和5.09我认为在这个情形下棒球击手会认为是被投球手击中了会有资格上一垒如果它依然存在的话
en:So the Major League Baseball rulesare a little bit hazy,but — (Laughter) — under rule 6.02 and 5.09,I think that in this situation,the batter would be considered hit by pitchand would be eligible to take first base,if it still existed.

zh-cn:这就是我常回答的问题我收到了大家留下的很多稀奇古怪的问题有某人问我从科学角度 隐藏一具尸体最佳最快办法是什么？你能快点解答这个问题吗？还有人写道以前也有人这样问你能否能证明心碎以后还能再次找到爱情？我还有人发信问很明显是家庭作业的问题他们希望我能帮忙
en:So this is the kind of question I answer,and I get people writing in witha lot of other strange questions.I&#39;ve had someone write and say,scientifically speaking, what is the bestand fastest way to hide a body?Can you do this one soon?And I had someone write in,I&#39;ve had people write in about,can you prove whether or not you can find love againafter your heart&#39;s broken?And I&#39;ve had people send inwhat are clearly homework questionsthey&#39;re trying to get me to do for them.

zh-cn:但几个月以前的某一周我收到一个关于谷歌的问题如果世界上所有的电子数据都储存在打孔卡上那么谷歌的仓库会有多大？现在 谷歌对他们的运营十分保密所以没人知道谷歌到底有多少数据实际上 没人真正知道谷歌有多少数据中心除了谷歌自己的人以外我也试图弄清楚 我跟他们碰过几次头想问他们 他们却不透露任何消息
en:But one week, a couple months ago,I got a question that was actually about Google.If all digital data in the worldwere stored on punch cards,how big would Google&#39;s data warehouse be?Now, Google&#39;s pretty secretiveabout their operations,so no one really knows how much data Google has,and in fact, no one really knowshow many data centers Google has,except people at Google itself.And I&#39;ve tried, I&#39;ve met them a few times,tried asking them, and theyaren&#39;t revealing anything.
时间： 3:28
zh-cn:于是我决定自己来搞清楚我注意到几件事我先从资金开始谷歌透露了他们的总支出那就可以估计他们可以建立多少个数据中心因为大的中心需要一定数额的预算你也可以在他们占世界硬件市场得份额上押宝结果是份额相当大我曾看到过一个估算我认为谷歌大约每一两分有一个驱动器失败而且他们只是把硬盘驱动丢掉更换一个新的所以他们消耗了大量硬盘驱动器因此通过支出你可以得知他们到底有多少个中心你也可以观察用电量看他们需要用多少电因为需要一定的电力来维持服务器当然谷歌比大部分的公司更有效率他们还是有基本的需求量那可以让你得知他们服务器数量的底线你还可以看已知的数据中心面积有多大？有多少房间？里面可以放多少个服务器？对于一些数据中心你也许可以得到这些信息中的两个你知道他们的开销同样 因为他们必须同所在地的政府签约来得到能源供应你会知道他们交易的内容从而得知消耗了多少能源你可以查看这些数字的比值然后计算一个没有这些信息的数据中心你可以弄清楚也许你只有这些条件中的一个你知道面积 那么你就可以推出电力也许是按比例的你可以用不同的数据进行同样的运算通过总储存库数量服务器的数量 每个服务器所需要的驱动器数量在每一项上用已知数据建出一个模型缩小对未知对象的猜测范围有些像在你想得知的数据中循环十分有趣这个数学计算并不很高级是真的不比解决数独更难
en:So I decided to try to figure this out myself.There are a few things that I looked at here.I started with money.Google has to reveal how much they spend,in general, and that lets you put some capson how many data centers could they be building,because a big data center costsa certain amount of money.And you can also then put a cap onhow much of the world harddrive market are they taking up,which turns out, it&#39;s pretty sizable.I read a calculation at one point,I think Google has a drive failureabout every minute or two,and they just throw out the hard driveand swap in a new one.So they go through a huge number of them.And so by looking at money,you can get an idea of howmany of these centers they have.You can also look at power.You can look at how much electricity they need,because you need a certain amountof electricity to run the servers,and Google is more efficient than most,but they still have some basic requirements,and that lets you put a limiton the number of servers that they have.You can also look at square footage and seeof the data centers that you know,how big are they?How much room is that?How many server racks could you fit in there?And for some data centers,you might get two of these pieces of information.You know how much they spent,and they also, say, because they had to contractwith the local governmentto get the power provided,you might know what they made a deal to buy,so you know how much power it takes.Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers,and figure out for a data centerwhere you don&#39;t have that information,you can figure out,but maybe you only have one of those,you know the square footage,then you could figure outwell, maybe the power is proportional.And you can do this same thingwith a lot of different quantities,you know, with guesses aboutthe total amount of storage,the number of servers, thenumber of drives per server,and in each case using what you knowto come up with a model that narrows downyour guesses for the things that you don&#39;t know.It&#39;s sort of circling around thenumber you&#39;re trying to get.And this is a lot of fun.The math is not all that advanced,and really it&#39;s like nothing more thansolving a sudoku puzzle.

zh-cn:我所做的 就是用了所有这些信息花了一两天的时间来调查有一些事情我未曾注意你可以上谷歌看他们贴出的招人信息你可以得知他们从何处发掘人才有时当人们去访问数据中心他们会用手机拍照 然后贴出来虽然他们不该这么做但是你可以由此了解硬件情况事实上 你还可以留意送皮萨的送餐员他们其实知道谷歌所有数据中心的位置至少是有人工作的数据中心
en:So what I did, I went through all of this information,spent a day or two researching.And there are some things I didn&#39;t look at.You could always look at the Googlerecruitment messages that they post.That gives you an idea of where they have people.Sometimes, when people visit a data center,they&#39;ll take a cell-cam photo and post it,and they aren&#39;t supposed to,but you can learn things abouttheir hardware that way.And in fact, you can justlook at pizza delivery drivers.Turns out, they know where allthe Google data centers are,at least the ones that have people in them.

zh-cn:但是我有一个让我感觉不错的估测就是覆盖整个谷歌的操作系统的差不多10EB的数据量另外还有5EB的离线数据保存在磁带驱动器里这印证了谷歌是世界上最大的消费者
en:But I came up with my estimate,which I felt pretty good about,that was about 10 exabytes of dataacross all of Google&#39;s operations,and then another maybe five exabytes or soof offline storage in tape drives,which it turns out Google isabout the world&#39;s largest consumer of.
时间： 6:20
zh-cn:我推断出来的这个估测这是惊人的数据量这比世界上任何其它的机构都大得多 据我们目前所知的。同时有几个竞争对手尤其是众所周知的美国国家安全局用同样一些方法我们可以观察安全局的数据中心虽然我们我们不清楚哪里的情况但很清楚他们的操作系统谷歌的大小不同
en:So I came up with this estimate, and this isa staggering amount of data.It&#39;s quite a bit more than any other organizationin the world has, as far as we know.There&#39;s a couple of other contenders,especially everyone always thinks of the NSA.But using some of these same methods,we can look at the NSA&#39;s data centers,and figure out, you know, wedon&#39;t know what&#39;s going on there,but it&#39;s pretty clear that their operationis not the size of Google&#39;s.

zh-cn:统计起来我想出了另一个我们可以回答的问题这些需要多少打孔卡？一个打孔卡大约能写下80个字母一个盒子大约可以装下2000张卡片然后你把它们放到 比如我的家乡新英格兰大概会以将近5千米的深度覆盖整个地区这大约是上一个冰河时期冰川厚度的三倍那大约是两万年前
en:Adding all of this up, I came up withthe other thing that we can answer, which is,how many punch cards would this take?And so a punch card can holdabout 80 characters,and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box,and you put them in, say,my home region of New England,it would cover the entire regionup to a depth of a little less than five kilometers,which is about three times deeperthan the glaciers during the last ice ageabout 20,000 years ago.
时间： 7:13
zh-cn:这并不切实际 但是我想这是我能推断出来的最好的答案于是我把它在网站上贴了出来我并没有期望得到谷歌回应因为他们那么神秘他们不会回答我的任何问题所以我只是贴出来顺便说我猜我们永远不会知道
en:So this is impractical, but I thinkthat&#39;s about the best answer I could come up with.And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up.And I didn&#39;t expect to get an answer from Google,because of course they&#39;ve been so secretive,they didn&#39;t answer of my questions,and so I just put it up and said,well, I guess we&#39;ll never know.

zh-cn:但是过了一阵几星期以后 我从谷歌得到一个信息嗨 这儿有一封给你的信我拿到后打开一看是打孔卡（笑声）谷歌出产的打孔卡在这个打孔卡上有很多孔我说 谢谢 谢谢啊后来怎么样了呢？我用软件开始阅读打孔卡并且扫描他们 结果这是一个谜语有一堆密码我得到一些朋友的帮助我们解破了密码 而里面是另一个密码有一些方程然后我们解决了这些方程最后显出了从谷歌发来的信息是他们对我文章的官方回复：“不予评置“（笑声）（鼓掌）
en:But then a little while laterI got a message, a couple weeks later, from Google,saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you.So I go and get it, open it up,and it&#39;s punch cards. (Laughter)Google-branded punch cards.And on these punch cards,there are a bunch of holes,and I said, thank you, thank you,okay, so what&#39;s on here?So I get some software and start reading it,and scan them, and it turns outit&#39;s a puzzle.There&#39;s a bunch of code,and I get some friends to help,and we crack the code, and theninside that is another code,and then there are some equations,and then we solve those equations,and then finally out pops a message from Googlewhich is their official answer to my article,and it said, &quot;No comment.&quot;(Laughter) (Applause)

zh-cn:我喜欢计算这类奇怪的东西并不是因为我就喜欢做数学我做很多演算但我不因为数学和喜欢数学我喜欢的是它让你利用一些已知的东西只是在纸上将一些符号移来移去就可以发现一些未知的东西这令人惊奇我有很多愚蠢的问题我喜欢数学给予了我能解决它们的力量
en:And I love calculating these kinds of things,and it&#39;s not that I love doing the math.I do a lot of math,but I don&#39;t really like math for its own sake.What I love is that it lets you takesome things that you know,and just by moving symbolsaround on a piece of paper,find out something that you didn&#39;t knowthat&#39;s very surprising.And I have a lot of stupid questions,and I love that math gives the powerto answer them sometimes.

zh-cn:但有时行不通这是我从一个读者那里得到的一个问题一个匿名的读者主题只是写了“紧急”邮件内容如下：“如果人们有轮子而且能够飞我们怎样把他们和飞机区分开来？”紧急（笑声）
en:And sometimes not.This is a question I got from a reader,an anonymous reader,and the subject line just said, &quot;Urgent,&quot;and this was the entire email:&quot;If people had wheels and could fly,how would we differentiate them from airplanes?&quot;Urgent. (Laughter)
时间： 9:10
zh-cn:我认为有些问题是数学不能回答的谢谢（鼓掌）
en:And I think there are some questionsthat math just cannot answer.Thank you.(Applause)
