zh-cn:我现在要讲的这个故事你们很多人已经知道了因为Steve的专栏后来成了一本书的基础，然后又被拍成电影其中Robert Downey Jr 扮演Steve LopezJamie Foxx扮演了Nathaniel Anthony Ayer他原本是茱莉亚音乐学院培训的双重贝斯手不料他的职业生涯却因为患上偏执型精神分裂症而不幸中断Nathaniel从茱莉亚音乐学院辍学，他完全崩溃了30年后的他流落在洛杉矶 Skid Row 大街上无家可归我鼓励大家都去看看Steve的书， 或者看看电影不光是去理解这两个男人之间建立的美好的纽带而且也看看音乐是如果帮助建立这种纽带的而那是最终改变Nathaniel流浪生活的最有用的工具
en:And I&#39;m telling a story that many of you know,because Steve&#39;s columns became the basisfor a book, which was turned into a movie,with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,the Juilliard-trained double bassistwhose promising career was cut shortby a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,and 30 years later he was living homelesson the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.I encourage all of you to read Steve&#39;s book or to watch the movieto understand not only the beautiful bondthat formed between these two men,but how music helped shape that bond,and ultimately was instrumental — if you&#39;ll pardon the pun —in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.

zh-cn:我和Ayers 先生在2008年相见那是两年前在迪斯尼音乐厅他才听了贝多芬第一，第四交响乐到后天来自我介绍他说话很愉快，很合群提到了马友友和希拉里.克林顿道奇队不可能进入世界联赛而这都是因为最后一刻贝多芬第四交响乐中开始的那段变幻莫测的小提琴演奏起的作用我们谈了一会儿音乐。 几天后我收到Steve的来信告诉我Nathaniel有兴趣跟我说学小提琴
en:I met Mr. Ayers in 2008,two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.He had just heard a performance of Beethoven&#39;s First and Fourth symphonies,and came backstage and introduced himself.He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious wayabout Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clintonand how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series,all because of the treacherous first violin passage workin the last movement of Beethoven&#39;s Fourth Symphony.And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days latersaying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.

zh-cn:我应该提一下的是Nathaniel拒绝治疗因为当初他接受的是电击疗法用的是镇静剂和手铐那些伤疤从此留在了他的生活中结果呢， 他的精神分裂症现在变得更容易发作最糟糕的表现是他发作后会消失几天在Skid Row大街上流浪暴露着内心的恐惧，让心灵的煎熬在身上释放
en:Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatmentbecause when he was treated it was with shock therapyand Thorazine and handcuffs,and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.But as a result now, he is prone tothese schizophrenic episodes,the worst of which can manifest themselves ashim explodingand then disappearing for days,wandering the streets of Skid Row,exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mindunleashed upon him.

zh-cn:Nathaniel当初就是处在这样的一种状态下我们在迪斯尼音乐厅开始了第一课的时候他的目光中夹杂着狂躁他是一个迷失了方向的人他提到了无形的恶魔和烟雾有人怎样在他睡觉时给他下毒
en:And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitationwhen we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall —he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,he was lost.And he was talking aboutinvisible demons and smoke,and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.

zh-cn:我感到很害怕不是为我自己的安全担心， 而是害怕我会失去他他又会沉浸到他的某一种他的状态中而我会毁了他和小提琴建立起来的关系如果我开始讲音阶和琶音和其他形式的精彩的说教式的小提琴教学法(笑声)于是， 我开始拉琴我演奏了贝多芬小提琴协奏曲的第一乐章
en:And I was afraid,not for myself, but I was afraidthat I was going to lose him,that he was going to sink into one of his states,and that I would ruin his relationship with the violinif I started talking about scalesand arpeggios and other exciting forms ofdidactic violin pedagogy.(Laughter)So, I just started playing.And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.

zh-cn:当我演奏的时候我知道Nathaniel的眼睛里有一种奥妙的变化好象他抓住了什么隐形的药象是经历了化学反应，而我的演奏就是催化剂他的狂躁愤怒也转化成理解安静的好奇， 和优雅神奇的是，他拿起了他的小提琴他也跟着开始演奏小提琴协奏曲的某些片断然后他又要我来完成，门德尔松柴可夫斯基，西贝柳斯于是我们开始谈论音乐：从巴赫到贝多芬，布拉姆斯布鲁克纳， 所有名字以B打头的人从巴托克一直到艾沙·佩卡·萨洛宁
en:And as I played,I understood that there was a profound changeoccurring in Nathaniel&#39;s eyes.It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,a chemical reaction, for which my playing the musicwas its catalyst.And Nathaniel&#39;s manic ragewas transformed into understanding,a quiet curiosity and grace.And in a miracle, he lifted his own violinand he started playing, by ear,certain snippets of violin concertoswhich he then asked me to complete — Mendelssohn,Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.And we started talking about music, from Bachto Beethoven and Brahms,Bruckner, all the B&#39;s,from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.

zh-cn:我了解到他不但是一本音乐大百科全书而且他能将这些音乐跟他个人的感受联系起来他讲到那些东西时充满了激情和对音乐深刻的理解，仿佛是我跟我在洛杉矶交响乐团的同事们之间交流时一样通过演奏音乐， 谈论音乐这个人从一个偏执，不安的刚才还在洛杉矶大街上晃悠的流浪汉变成了一个迷人，博学优秀的受过朱丽亚音乐学院教育的音乐家
en:And I understood that he not onlyhad an encyclopedic knowledge of music,but he related to this music at a personal level.He spoke about it with the kind of passionand understanding that I share with my colleaguesin the Los Angeles Philharmonic.And through playing music and talking about music,this man had transformedfrom the paranoid, disturbed manthat had just come from walking the streetsof downtown Los Angelesto the charming, erudite,brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.

zh-cn:音乐是良药。音乐改变着我们对nathaniel来说， 音乐是帮助他开启心智因为音乐可以帮他将他的思维妄想，转换成形通过他的想象力和创造力变成现实而正是这个帮助他从煎熬中解脱出来而我知道这就是艺术的真髓这正是我们创造音乐的原因我们用我们每个人都拥有的一种内在我们的最根本的核心我们的感情通过我们的艺术的镜头通过我们的创造力，将我们的情感塑造成现实而这种现实的表达传递给我们所有的人感动我们， 启迪我们，团结我们
en:Music is medicine. Music changes us.And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.Because music allows him to take his thoughtsand delusions and shape themthrough his imagination and his creativity,into reality.And that is an escapefrom his tormented state.And I understood that this was the very essence of art.This was the very reason why we made music,that we take something that exists within all of usat our very fundamental core,our emotions,and through our artistic lens,through our creativity, we&#39;re able to shape those emotions into reality.And the reality of that expressionreaches all of usand moves us, inspires and unites us.

en:And for Nathaniel,music brought him back into a fold of friends.The redemptive power of music brought him backinto a family of musiciansthat understood him,that recognized his talentsand respected him.And I will always make music with Nathaniel,whether we&#39;re at Walt Disney Concert Hallor on Skid Row, because he reminds mewhy I became a musician.Thank you.(Applause)
