zh-cn:照片里的人是Maurice DruonL&#39;Academie francaise的荣誉终身秘书长—也就是法兰西学院穿着价值六万八千美元的豪华制服对法兰西学院来说倒很适合因为它规范着法语的正确用法使这门语言永世长存法兰西学院有两个主要任务它编纂官方的法语词典—他们目前在编第九部从1930年就开始了，现在编到了P字头。他们还规范正确的用法比如，电子邮件（email）在法语里的正确说法应该是&quot;courriel&quot;他们告诉法国人，万维网（World Wide Web）应该被叫做&quot;la toile d&#39;araignee modiale&quot;—“环球蜘蛛网”诸如此类法国人民欣然忽略的建议
en:This is a picture of Maurice Druon,the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L&#39;Academie francaise,the French Academy.He is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform,befitting the role of the French Academyas legislating thecorrect usage in Frenchand perpetuating the language.The French Academy has two main tasks:it compiles a dictionary of official French.They&#39;re now working on their ninth edition,which they began in 1930, and they&#39;ve reached the letter P.They also legislate on correct usage,such as the proper term for what the French call &quot;email,&quot;which ought to be &quot;courriel.&quot;The World Wide Web, the French are told,ought to be referred to as&quot;la toile d&#39;araignee mondiale&quot; — the Global Spider Web —recommendations that the French gaily ignore.

zh-cn:这是语言产生的众多模型之一：也就是说，由一个学院来进行规范但任何懂得语言的人都意识到这是愚蠢的自负语言产生于人类心灵间的互动而在语言的不停变化中，这是显而易见的事实上，当法兰西学院完成他们的词典时它早已经过时了。
en:Now, this is one model of how language comes to be:namely, it&#39;s legislated by an academy.But anyone who looks at language realizesthat this is a rather silly conceit,that language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language —the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary,it will already be well out of date.

zh-cn:我们看到俗语和术语不断产生历史上语言在变化方言在分支新的语言在形成所以语言并不只是创造、塑造人性之物同样是反映人性的窗口我正在写的一本书中我希望能阐明人性的一些方面包括认知机能人们靠这个把世界概念化还有掌管人类互动的各类关系。今天早上，我将对它们逐一简要介绍。
en:We see it in theconstant appearance of slang and jargon,of the historical change in languages,in divergence of dialectsand the formation of new languages.So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature,so much as a window onto human nature.In a book that I&#39;m currently working on,I hope to use language to shed light ona number of aspects of human nature,including the cognitive machinerywith which humans conceptualize the worldand the relationship types that govern human interaction.And I&#39;m going to say a few words about each one this morning.

zh-cn:让我从一个语言中的技术性问题开始我研究这个问题已经有一段时间了希望你们能包涵一下，包涵我对动词，和它们用法的热情问题在于，哪个动词用于哪个构式？动词是句子的基座，其他部分都安在这个基座上。
en:Let me start off with a technical problem in languagethat I&#39;ve worried about for quite some time —and indulge mein my passion for verbs and how they&#39;re used.The problem is, which verbs go in which constructions?The verb is the chassis of the sentence.It&#39;s the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.
时间： 2:35
zh-cn:让我提醒你们一下这是你们早已忘记的东西。不及物动词，比如“用餐”(dine)不能带有直接的宾语你得说：“山姆用餐了(Sam dined)&quot;,而不是“山姆用餐了比萨饼(Sam dined the pizza.&quot;一个及物动词要求必须有宾语：“山姆吞吃比萨饼(Sam devoured the pizza)”。你不能只是说“山姆吞吃(Sam devoured)”。有许许多多这类的动词每个都塑造着句子。所以在解释孩子们如何学习语言时候，有一个问题同样也是教成人学外语语法时的一个问题以及给电脑编使用语言的程序时—在哪个构式里该用哪个动词？
en:Let me give you a quick reminderof something that you&#39;ve long forgotten.An intransitive verb, such as &quot;dine,&quot; for example,can&#39;t take a direct object.You have to say, &quot;Sam dined,&quot; not, &quot;Sam dined the pizza.&quot;A transitive verb mandatesthat there has to be an object there:&quot;Sam devoured the pizza.&quot; You can&#39;t just say, &quot;Sam devoured.&quot;There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type,each of which shapes its sentence.So, a problem in explaining how children learn language,a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don&#39;t make grammatical errors,and a problem in programming computers to use language iswhich verbs go in which constructions.
时间： 3:15
zh-cn:比如，英语中的与格构式—可以说“Give a muffin to a mouse”，前置词与格，或者“Give a mouse a muffin”，双宾语与格，&quot;Promise anything to her“，”Promise her anything“，等等。上百的动词可以两用。对于孩子，很容易去做的一个归纳—对于大人和电脑来说也一样—就是任何可以在下面这个构式中出现的动词“主语-动词-物体-to-a 接受者”也可以表达成“主语-动词-接受者-东西”。这是很顺手的事因为语言是无穷的对于你学过的句子不能只是鹦鹉学舌。你必须得做出归纳这样你才能制造、理解新句子。这就是这样做的一个例子
en:For example, the dative construction in English.You can say, &quot;Give a muffin to a mouse,&quot; the prepositional dative.Or, &quot;Give a mouse a muffin,&quot; the double-object dative.&quot;Promise anything to her,&quot; &quot;Promise her anything,&quot; and so on.Hundreds of verbs can go both ways.So a tempting generalization for a child,for an adult, for a computeris that any verb that can appear in the construction,&quot;subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient&quot;can also be expressed as &quot;subject-verb-recipient-thing.&quot;A handy thing to have,because language is infinite,and you can&#39;t just parrot back the sentences that you&#39;ve heard.You&#39;ve got to extract generalizationsso you can produce and understand new sentences.This would be an example of how to do that.

zh-cn:不幸的是，这方面有例外。你可以说，“Biff drove the car to Chicago”。但不是“Biff drove Chicago the car”。你可以说：“Sal gave Jason a headache”，但“Sal gave a headache to Jason”就很别扭了。原因是这些构式，尽管一开始相似但并不是同义句。当你搬出显微镜对准在人类认知上，你会看到很多微妙的差别存在于它们的意思里。所以“Give the X to the Y”—这个构式对应的想法是：“Cause X to go to Y”，而“Give the Y the X”对应的想法是“cause Y to have X”。
en:Unfortunately, there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions.You can say, &quot;Biff drove the car to Chicago,&quot;but not, &quot;Biff drove Chicago the car.&quot;You can say, &quot;Sal gave Jason a headache,&quot;but it&#39;s a bit odd to say, &quot;Sal gave a headache to Jason.&quot;The solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance,are not synonymous,that when you crank up the microscopeon human cognition, you see that there&#39;s a subtle differencein meaning between them.So, &quot;give the X to the Y,&quot;that construction corresponds to the thought&quot;cause X to go to Y.&quot; Whereas &quot;give the Y the X&quot;corresponds to the thought &quot;cause Y to have X.&quot;

zh-cn:许多时候我们都有理解偏差类似于经典的“形象-背景”颠倒的幻术你要么吧注意力放在某个物体上使周围的空间从注意力中退去要么你集中注意观察空间的构造这样前景中的物体就从意识中退去这些理解如何反应在语言当中？在两种情况里，那个被解释为受影响的东西被表达成了直接宾语：动词之后的名词。当你想到“使蛋糕去某处”时当你对蛋糕实施动作时你说：“Give the muffin to the mouse.”当你理解成“使老鼠拥有某物”你对老鼠实施动作所以你把它表达成：“Give the mouse the muffin.”
en:Now, many events can be subject to either construal,kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions,in which you can either pay attentionto the particular object,in which case the space around it recedes from attention,or you can see the faces in the empty space,in which case the object recedes out of consciousness.How are these construals reflected in language?Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affectedis expressed as the direct object,the noun after the verb.So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere —where you&#39;re doing something to the muffin —you say, &quot;Give the muffin to the mouse.&quot;When you construe it as &quot;cause the mouse to have something,&quot;you&#39;re doing something to the mouse,and therefore you express it as, &quot;Give the mouse the muffin.&quot;
时间： 5:21
zh-cn:所以，在哪个构式里用哪个动词我一开始提出的问题取决于动词是否指出某种运动或者某种所有权的变化&quot;给出某物“当中包含&quot;使某物前往&quot;也包含”使某人拥有“开车只能使某物走开因为芝加哥不是那种能拥有某物的东西。只有人才能拥有东西。“令人头痛”使人具有头痛但你并不会把头痛从手里给出去让它到另一个人那里去然后再放进对方脑袋里。你只可能是说话太大声，或者讨人厌或者用其他的方法使对方头疼。所以这是我工作内容的一个例子。
en:So which verbs go in which construction —the problem with which I began —depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motionor a kind of possession change.To give something involves both causing something to goand causing someone to have.To drive the car only causes something to go,because Chicago&#39;s not the kind of thing that can possess something.Only humans can possess things.And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache,but it&#39;s not as if you&#39;re taking the headache out of your headand causing it to go to the other person,and implanting it in them.You may just be loud or obnoxious,or some other way causing them to have the headache.So, that&#39;san example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.

zh-cn:那为什么有人要在乎这工作呢？这是因为有许多有趣的结论从这个例子，还有类似的对很多英语动词的分析中可以得出。首先，存在着一个精细的概念结构我们自动、无意识地计算产生它每当我们想到或者说出一个主导我们对语言的使用的句子你可以把它理解成“思想的语言”，或者“思想语”。
en:So why should anyone care?Well, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think,from this and many similar kinds of analysesof hundreds of English verbs.First, there&#39;s a level of fine-grained conceptual structure,which we automatically and unconsciously computeevery time we produce or utter a sentence, that governs our use of language.You can think of this as the language of thought, or &quot;mentalese.&quot;
时间： 6:28
zh-cn:它看上去是建立在一套固定的概念之上这套概念管理着数十个构式和数千个动词不仅仅是英文的，而是所有语言的最基本概念，比如空间时间、因果以及人的意愿比如，什么是手段，什么是目的？这些跟康德所主张的，构成人类思想的基本框架的那些范畴很相似很有趣的是，我们对语言的无意识的使用好像在折射着这些康德主义的范畴—不在乎感官的性质比如颜色、材质、重量和速度上述这些都几乎从不区分动词在不同构式中的用法。
en:It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts,which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs —not only in English, but in all other languages —fundamental concepts such as space,time, causation and human intention,such as, what is the means and what is the ends?These are reminiscent of the kinds of categoriesthat Immanuel Kant arguedare the basic framework for human thought,and it&#39;s interesting that our unconscious use of languageseems to reflect these Kantian categories.Doesn&#39;t care about perceptual qualities,such as color, texture, weight and speed,which virtually never differentiatethe use of verbs in different constructions.
时间： 7:07
zh-cn:此外，英语中的所有构式不仅仅有字面意义还有准隐喻的用法。就拿与格来说，不仅用来转移事物，还用来比喻思想的转移，比如，&quot;She told a story to me&quot;或者&quot;told me a story&quot;&quot;Max taught Spanish to the student&quot;或者&quot;taught the students Spanish.&quot;这都是完全一样的构式但里面没有蛋糕或者老鼠。完全没有运动。这使人想起语言交流中的&quot;容器隐喻&quot;在这里面我们把想法理解成实物句子就像容器语言交流就像快递当我们说&quot;gather&quot;（收集）我们的想法，并&quot;&#39;put&#39; them &#39;into&#39; word&quot;（把它们付诸语言）如果我们说的话并不&quot;empty&quot;(空)或者&quot;hollow&quot;（空洞）我们就可以把意思传达“过去”(“across&quot;)让一个能够”拆解“(&quot;unpack&quot;)我们的语言而提取“内涵”(&quot;content&quot;)
en:An additional twist is that all of the constructions in Englishare used not only literally,but in a quasi-metaphorical way.For example, this construction, the dative,is used not only to transfer things,but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas,as when we say, &quot;She told a story to me&quot;or &quot;told me a story,&quot;&quot;Max taught Spanish to the students&quot; or &quot;taught the students Spanish.&quot;It&#39;s exactly the same construction,but no muffins, no mice, nothing moving at all.It evokes the container metaphor of communication,in which we conceive of ideas as objects,sentences as containers,and communication as a kind of sending.As when we say we &quot;gather&quot; our ideas, to &quot;put&quot; them &quot;into&quot; words,and if our words aren&#39;t &quot;empty&quot; or &quot;hollow,&quot;we might get these ideas &quot;across&quot; to a listener,who can &quot;unpack&quot; our words to &quot;extract&quot; their &quot;content.&quot;
时间： 7:55
zh-cn:诸如此类的修辞法不是个例，而是广泛规则想找到纯抽象的而非实物隐喻的表达的例子难之又难譬如说，你可以用动词&quot;go&quot;以及介词&quot;to&quot;和&quot;from&quot;来表达字面意思：“信使从巴黎去了伊斯坦布尔。”(&quot;The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul.&quot;)你也可以说，”比夫从病中康复。(&quot;Biff went from sick to well.&quot; )他哪里都没”去“，而是可能一直呆在床上但是我们说话时仿佛他的健康状况是空间中的点你给它一种动的概念或者，“会从3点一直开到4点，”(&quot;The meeting went from three to four,&quot;)这里我们把时间想成分布在一条直线上与此相似地，我们用力的概念来表示不仅仅是物理的力比如，&quot;Rose forced the door to open,&quot;（罗斯用力把门打开）也包括人际间的作用力比如，&quot;Rose forced Sadie to go&quot;（罗斯把萨蒂逼走了）—不一定要推推搡搡的而是通过威胁—或者&quot;Rose forced Sadie to go&quot;（罗斯逼她自己离开）仿佛罗斯的头脑里有两个东西在进行拔河
en:And indeed, this kind of verbiage is not the exception, but the rule.It&#39;s very hard to find any example of abstract languagethat is not based on some concrete metaphor.For example, you can use the verb &quot;go&quot;and the prepositions &quot;to&quot; and &quot;from&quot;in a literal, spatial sense.&quot;The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul.&quot;You can also say, &quot;Biff went from sick to well.&quot;He needn&#39;t go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time,but it&#39;s as if his health is a point in state spacethat you conceptualize as moving.Or, &quot;The meeting went from three to four,&quot;in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line.Likewise, we use &quot;force&quot; to indicatenot only physical force,as in, &quot;Rose forced the door to open,&quot;but also interpersonal force,as in, &quot;Rose forced Sadie to go,&quot; not necessarily by manhandling her,but by issuing a threat.Or, &quot;Rose forced herself to go,&quot;as if there were two entities inside Rose&#39;s head,engaged in a tug of a war.

zh-cn:第二个结论是用不同方式构思同一事件的能力比如，“使某物到某人那里，”和“使某人拥有某物，”我认为这是人类思维的基本特点而且是人类论辩的基础论辩中人们争议的一般不是事实而是应该如何理解它们这里是一些例子：是“终止怀孕”还是“杀死胚胎”“一个细胞聚合的小球”还是“一个尚未出生的孩子”“侵略伊拉克”或是“解放伊拉克”“收入重新分配”抑或“没收财产”而整个图景中最显著的一部分是要看到一点：就是我们对抽象事件的描述大多都是基于实体的隐喻这反映出人类智能本身是由一整套概念组成比如物体、空间、时间，因果关系与意图—对我们这种群居的、知识密集型的种群非常有用我们能想象人类的进化和语言的隐喻抽象化过程齐轨并行慢慢地这些概念里原先的实际内容就淡化了空间、时间和力—而它们却被用在全新的抽象领域里如此就使得我们这个原本是进化出来和石头、工具与动物打交道的种群能够形成数学、物理、法律等等概念涉足其他抽象的领域
en:Second conclusion is that the ability to conceiveof a given event in two different ways,such as &quot;cause something to go to someone&quot;and &quot;causing someone to have something,&quot;I think is a fundamental feature of human thought,and it&#39;s the basis for much human argumentation,in which people don&#39;t differ so much on the factsas on how they ought to be construed.Just to give you a few examples:&quot;ending a pregnancy&quot; versus &quot;killing a fetus;&quot;&quot;a ball of cells&quot; versus &quot;an unborn child;&quot;&quot;invading Iraq&quot; versus &quot;liberating Iraq;&quot;&quot;redistributing wealth&quot; versus &quot;confiscating earnings.&quot;And I think the biggest picture of allwould take seriously the factthat so much of our verbiage about abstract eventsis based on a concrete metaphorand see human intelligence itselfas consisting of a repertoire of concepts —such as objects, space, time, causation and intention —which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species,whose evolution you can well imagine,and a process of metaphorical abstractionthat allows us to bleach these conceptsof their original conceptual content —space, time and force —and apply them to new abstract domains,therefore allowing a species that evolvedto deal with rocks and tools and animals,to conceptualize mathematics, physics, lawand other abstract domains.

zh-cn:我曾说过我要谈谈人性的两扇窗户我们用来概念化世界的知性机能现在我要说说几种人际关系它们支配着人类的社交活动同样，这些都体现在语言里我要从间接话语行为这个谜题开始我相信你们中大多数人都看过《冰血暴》(或译为法哥镇）这部电影你们可能还记得其中的一段：一个警官要绑匪把车开到路边叫他出示驾照绑匪把钱包拿出来有一张50美元的钞票以一个小角度从钱包里伸出来然后绑匪说，“我在想或许在法哥镇这个鬼地方我们俩得共同保管这个”—每个人，包括观众都理解为含蓄地提出贿赂这种间接表意在语言中泛滥比如说在礼貌地提要求时如果有人说，“如果你把鳄梨色拉酱递过来就太棒了”我们太清楚他是什么意思了尽管字面上表达出来是个很别扭的概念
en:Well, I said I&#39;d talk about two windows on human nature —the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world,and now I&#39;m going to say a few words about the relationship typesthat govern human social interaction,again, as reflected in language.And I&#39;ll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts.Now, I&#39;m sure most of you have seen the movie &quot;Fargo.&quot;And you might remember the scene in whichthe kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer,is asked to show his driver&#39;s licenseand holds his wallet outwith a 50-dollar bill extendingat a slight angle out of the wallet.And he says, &quot;I was just thinkingthat maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo,&quot;which everyone, including the audience,interprets as a veiled bribe.This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language.For example, in polite requests,if someone says, &quot;If you could pass the guacamole,that would be awesome,&quot;we know exactly what he means,even though that&#39;s a rather bizarreconcept being expressed.

zh-cn:“您愿意来看一下我的蚀刻版画吗？”我想大多数人理解这么说的意图同样的，倘若有人说“呦，你的店真不错。要是发生了点什么事儿可就不好了”—（笑）我们知道这是个委婉的威胁而不是在思考假设的可能性所以我们说的谜题就是：为什么贿赂礼貌的要求、恳请、威胁经常要遮遮掩掩的？没人是傻子双方都知道谈话人说的是什么谈话人也知道听者心里清楚谈话人知道听者心里清楚，等等，等等所以这是在干嘛呢？
en:&quot;Would you like to come up and see my etchings?&quot;I think most peopleunderstand the intent behind that.And likewise, if someone says,&quot;Nice store you&#39;ve got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it&quot; —(Laughter) —we understand that as a veiled threat,rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.So the puzzle is, why are bribes,polite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled?No one&#39;s fooled.Both parties know exactly what the speaker means,and the speaker knows the listener knowsthat the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.So what&#39;s going on?

zh-cn:关键是在于语言是磋商人际关系的一种途径而人际关系分为许多种人类学家Alan Fiske给出了一个关于影响力的分类法其中人际关系可以被或多或少地归为“公社性”，它的作用原则是“我的就是你的，你的就是我的”—家庭内部的一种心态，例如—统治心态，其原则就是“别惹我，”互惠心态：“你帮我挠背，我帮你挠背，”性心理：如Cole Porter的不朽名言所说，“来吧”
en:I think the key idea is that languageis a way of negotiating relationships,and human relationships fall into a number of types.There&#39;s an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske,in which relationships can be categorized, more or less,into communality, which works on the principle&quot;what&#39;s mine is thine, what&#39;s thine is mine,&quot;the kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example;dominance, whose principle is &quot;don&#39;t mess with me;&quot;reciprocity, &quot;you scratch my back, I&#39;ll scratch yours;&quot;and sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, &quot;Let&#39;s do it.&quot;
时间：12:26
zh-cn:人际关系的类型是可以通过磋商决定的尽管经常有某种默认情况指定了上面心态中的一种人际关类型可以被拉伸、调整比如说“公社性”在家庭和朋友们中最自然但它可以被用来把分享的心态转移给平时并不习惯于分享的群体—例如帮派或者男生联谊会女生联谊会，像“男人之家”这样的表达法这样就让非亲非故的人们能够采用一般都是近亲之间才有的关系类型
en:Now, relationship types can be negotiated.Even though there are default situationsin which one of these mindsets can be applied,they can be stretched and extended.For example, communality applies most naturallywithin family or friends,but it can be used to try to transferthe mentality of sharingto groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations,sororities, locutions like &quot;the family of man,&quot;you try to get people who are not relatedto use the relationship type that would ordinarilybe appropriate to close kin.
时间：13:05
zh-cn:可是当一方采用某一种关系类型而另一方用了另一种— 搭配错误的时候就尴尬了假如你走过去随手就从你老板的盘子里弄了一只虾吃打个比方的话，这就是一个尴尬的情况或者是餐后有一位客人掏出钱包说要付钱给你这也会相当尴尬在不那么明显的例子中还是有一种磋商在进行着比如说在工作场所在员工是否能和老板套近乎这一点上都有一点紧张不安或者是称呼他或她首名（而不是叫XX先生或女士）如果两个朋友进行一笔交易，比如卖一辆车大家都知道这可能是紧张和尴尬的来源比如约会中从友谊到性关系的过度众所周知，可能导致各种各样的尴尬局面工作场所的性也是我们把两种关系类型—支配关系和性关系—间的冲突叫做“性骚扰”
en:Now, mismatches — when one person assumes one relationship type,and another assumes a different one — can be awkward.If you went over and you helped yourselfto a shrimp off your boss&#39; plate,for example, that would be an awkward situation.Or if a dinner guest after the mealpulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal,that would be rather awkward as well.In less blatant cases,there&#39;s still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.In the workplace, for example,there&#39;s often a tension over whether an employeecan socialize with the boss,or refer to him or heron a first-name basis.If two friends have areciprocal transaction, like selling a car,it&#39;s well known that this can be a sourceof tension or awkwardness.In dating, the transitionfrom friendship to sexcan lead to, notoriously, various forms of awkwardness,and as can sex in the workplace,in which we call the conflict between adominant and a sexual relationship &quot;sexual harassment.&quot;
时间：14:03
zh-cn:这个和语言有什么关系呢？语言作为一种社会相互作用必须满足两个条件你得传达内容—这里我们又回到容器的隐喻你想表达贿赂、命令、许诺的意思恳请以及其他但是你还得磋商并保持你和那个人的关系我认为解决的答案是我们在两个层面上使用语言字面意思表达的是与听者的最安全的关系而引伸义我们留给听者自己去领会的言外之意—则使他发掘出这个语境中最恰当的解释而这有可能促成一种新的人际关系
en:Well, what does this have to do with language?Well, language, as a social interaction,has to satisfy two conditions.You have to convey the actual content —here we get back to the container metaphor.You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise,the solicitation and so on,but you also have to negotiateand maintain the kind of relationshipyou have with the other person.The solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels:the literal form signalsthe safest relationship with the listener,whereas the implicated content —the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform —allows the listener to derive the interpretationwhich is most relevant in context,which possibly initiates a changed relationship.
时间：14:45
zh-cn:最简单的例子出自于礼貌的要求倘若你用一个条件句表达请求：“您要是能开一下窗子就太好了，”尽管内容是祈使句仅仅因为你没有用祈使语态就显示出你并没有按照一种支配的人际关系行事你并没有假设他人必须服从可另一方面，你想要那个该死的鳄梨沙拉酱用一个“如果—那么”巨型，你把意思说清楚了却不会让人觉得你在指使他
en:The simplest example of this is in the polite request.If you express your request as a conditional —&quot;if you could open the window, that would be great&quot; —even though the content is an imperative,the fact that you&#39;re not using the imperative voicemeans that you&#39;re not acting as if you&#39;re in a relationship of dominance,where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.By expressing it as an if-then statement,you can get the message acrosswithout appearing to boss another person around.

zh-cn:我认为这样挺微妙，效果也不错种种含蓄的言行保留了拒绝的可能：贿赂、威胁、提议恳请等等有一种理解方式就是想象当语言只能表达字面义你可以把它当作博弈论中的得失矩阵来思考把你放在那个想贿赂警官的绑匪的位置上全部的赌注都压在这两种可能性上：警官不老实或者他是老实人假如你不贿赂他，你得吃罚单—或者，就像《冰风血》中的情况一样，那更糟不管那个警官到底老实不老实：爱拼才会赢这种情况下，后果很严重换一方面，你要是掏出钱来如果警官吃贿赂，你全身而退，讨了个大巧如果警官是老实人，你因为行贿被逮起来所以情况挺复杂的
en:And in a more subtle way, I think, this worksfor all of the veiled speech actsinvolving plausible deniability:the bribes, threats, propositions,solicitations and so on.One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be likeif language — where it could only be used literally.And you can think of it in terms of agame-theoretic payoff matrix.Put yourself in the position of thekidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.There&#39;s a high stakesin the two possibilitiesof having a dishonest officer or an honest officer.If you don&#39;t bribe the officer,then you will get a traffic ticket —or, as is the case of &quot;Fargo,&quot; worse —whether the honest officeris honest or dishonest.Nothing ventured, nothing gained.In that case, the consequences are rather severe.On the other hand, if you extend the bribe,if the officer is dishonest,you get a huge payoff of going free.If the officer is honest, you get a huge penaltyof being arrested for bribery.So this is a rather fraught situation.

zh-cn:然而，你要是含沙射影地说如果你含蓄地提出给钱那么不老实的警官可以把它理解为你要使银子你就可以走了而诚实的警官也不能硬说你贿赂他因此你领一张讨厌的罚单不过你两种可能中都受益最大化了我觉得同样的分析方法可以用在可能出现尴尬的提出性的要求的时候以及其他的当保留拒绝可的能性对你有利的情况这就应证了一个外交官们早已深谙的秘密—那就是：语言的模糊根本不是什么故障或缺憾而很可能是语言的特征一个我们能在社交中善加利用的特征
en:On the other hand, with indirect language,if you issue a veiled bribe,then the dishonest officercould interpret it as a bribe,in which case you get the payoff of going free.The honest officer can&#39;t hold you to it as being a bribe,and therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket.So you get the best of both worlds.And a similar analysis, I think,can apply to the potential awkwardnessof a sexual solicitation,and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset.I think this affirmssomething that&#39;s long been known by diplomats —namely, that the vagueness of language,far from being a bug or an imperfection,actually might be a feature of language,one that we use to our advantage in social interactions.
