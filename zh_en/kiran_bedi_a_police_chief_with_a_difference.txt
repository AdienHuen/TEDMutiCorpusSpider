zh-cn:让我给大家讲个故事。这是个发生在印度的故事，关于一个印度女性和她的心路历程。让我从我的父母开始讲。我是这对远见卓识的父母的产物。多年前当我出生时，正是五十年代 —在印度五十年代，六十年代，是不属于女性的。这是个属于男性的时代。这个时代属于自己创业的男性，以及从父母那里继承家业的男性。女孩子们则像洋娃娃一样打扮起来嫁人。我的家庭，在我的城市 —甚至整个国家 — 是非常特殊的。我们姐妹四个，很幸运没有一个兄弟，我们是四姐妹。我的父母是祖祖代代拥有地产的家庭。我的父亲为了教育我们四姐妹，和我的祖父争执，几乎丢掉了继承权。他把我们送进了城里最好的学校给了我们最好的教育。我曾说，当我们出生时，我们不能选择父母。当我们上学时，我们也没法选择学校。（在印度）孩子们不能选学校，只是去上父母替他们选好的学校。所以这个时期给我打下了基础。我自由成长，我的三个姐妹也是。我父亲曾说，“我要把我的四个女儿送到世界的四个角落去。”我不知道他是不是真的想让我们远走，但是这的确发生了。我是唯一留在印度的。我的姐妹们一个在英国，一个在美国，一个在加拿大。我们四个天各一方。
en:Now I&#39;m going to give you a story.It&#39;s an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.Let me begin with my parents.I&#39;m a product of thisvisionary mother and father.Many years ago, when I was born in the &#39;50s —&#39;50s and &#39;60sdidn&#39;t belong to girls in India.They belonged to boys.They belonged to boys who would join businessand inherit business from parents,and girls would be dolled up to get married.My family, in my city,and almost in the country, was unique.We were four of us, not one,and fortunately no boys.We were four girls and no boys.And my parents were partof a landed property family.My father defied his own grandfather,almost to the point of disinheritance,because he decided to educateall four of us.He sent us to one of the best schools in the cityand gave us the best education.As I&#39;ve said, when we&#39;re born, we don&#39;t choose our parents,and when we go to school, we don&#39;t choose our school.Children don&#39;t choose a school.They just get the school which parents choose for them.So this is the foundation time which I got.I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters.And my father used to say at that time,&quot;I&#39;m going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world.&quot;I don&#39;t know if he really meant [that], but it happened.I&#39;m the only one who&#39;s left in India.One is a British, another is an Americanand the third is a Canadian.So we are four of us in four corners of the world.

zh-cn:我提过我的模范典型就是我的父母，我从他们身上继承了两样东西。一个是他们说的：“生命像爬斜坡，不进则退。”第二件，一直伴随我，它成为了我的生命哲学，让我的生命截然不同，就是一百件事发生在你的生命中，不管好的坏的。九十件是你自己创造的。九十件中有好事，你创造的就享受它们。要是你做了坏事，就从中学习。一百件中只有十件是自然控制的，你无能为力。这就好像亲友去世，龙卷风，飓风，地震，你是无能为力的。你只能被动作出反应。但是你的反应也包含在这九十件能够掌控的事情之中。我是这个哲学下的产物，九成一成哲学（90/10），也同时相信生命像爬斜坡。这就是我的成长之路 —珍视我所得。我得到了很多机会，很多非常珍贵的机会，那是五六十年代的女孩子很少得到的。我也认识到我父母给我的教育是非常独特的。因为所有我学校里的好朋友都被打扮起来连同大批陪嫁嫁人了。而我背着个网球拍子，整天就是上学，参加各种业余活动。我觉得我必须给你们讲这个故事，因为这是我的背景。
en:And since I said they&#39;re my role models,I followed two things which my father and mother gave me.One, they said, &quot;Life is on an incline.You either go up,or you come down.&quot;And the second thing, which has stayed with me,which became my philosophy of life,which made all the difference,is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.Out of 100, 90 are your creation.They&#39;re good. They&#39;re your creation. Enjoy it.If they&#39;re bad, they&#39;re your creation. Learn from it.Ten are nature-sent over which you can&#39;t do a thing.It&#39;s like a death of a relative,or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake.You can&#39;t do a thing about it.You&#39;ve got to just respond to the situation.But that response comes out of those 90 points.Since I&#39;m a product of this philosophy,of 90/10,and secondly, &quot;life on an incline,&quot;that&#39;s the way I grew upto be valuing what I got.I&#39;m a product of opportunities,rare opportunities in the &#39;50s and the &#39;60s,which girls didn&#39;t get,and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving mewas something unique.Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled upto get married with a lot of dowry,and here I was with a tennis racket and going to schooland doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.I thought I must tell you this.Why I said this, is the background.

zh-cn:现在我要讲我做了什么。我成了一个作风强硬的女性，加入了印度警察局，我也是一个具有不屈不挠毅力的女性，因为我曾是网球冠军等等。但是我参加了印度警察局。之后开始了新的治安政策。我认为警察应该负责纠察，预防和侦察。这给了印度警察系统一个新的定义 —预防。因为通常我们只强调侦查。或者惩戒。但是我认为不是这样的，第一位是预防，因为这是我从我的成长经历学到的：怎么能够预防百分之十的事故发生?怎么能够不发生更多事故?这是我怎么进行工作的思考，和男性的工作思维模式大不相同。我并没有刻意求异，但是我的理念确实不同于男人。因为我就是有所不同。这样我修改了印度的警察理念。我将介绍给大家两个改革，一个是警察系统的改革，一个是我的监狱改革。这里我们看到的，如果你看这个标题，它叫作：“总理车被扣。”这是有史以来第一次印度总理的车子被罚停车票。（众笑）印度史上第一次，我也不怕说，也是最后一次。以后在印度这再也不会发生了，因为现在的政策是一次被扣永不发还。这是因为我为人很敏感，有同情心，在公正性方面也很敏感，又好见义勇为。这也是我作为女人参加警察部门的原因。我有其他的选择，但是我没有选它们。
en:This is what comes next.I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman,a woman with indefatigable stamina,because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.But I joined the Indian Police Service,and then it was a new pattern of policing.For me the policing stood for power to correct,power to prevent and power to detect.This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India —the power to prevent.Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that&#39;s it,or power to punish.But I decided no, it&#39;s a power to prevent,because that&#39;s what I learned when I was growing up.How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?So this was how it came into my service,and it was different from the men.I didn&#39;t want to make it different from the men, but it was different,because this was the way I was different.And I redefined policing concepts in India.I&#39;m going to take you on two journeys,my policing journey and my prison journey.What you see, if you see the titlecalled &quot;PM&#39;s car held.&quot;This was the first time a prime minister of Indiawas given a parking ticket.(Laughter)That&#39;s the first time in India,and I can tell you, that&#39;s the last time you&#39;re hearing about it.It&#39;ll never happen again in India,because now it was once and forever.And the rule was, because I was sensitive,I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice,and I was very pro-justice.That&#39;s the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.I had other options, but I didn&#39;t choose them.

zh-cn:下一个要讲的是，我的政策是严格执法，公平执法。如今我被认为是个不听管教的女性。所以我常被派到所有恣意妄为的部门，那些别人都不愿意去的部门。目前我被派到一个监狱作警察，通常警察是不愿直接在监狱工作的。他们（警察局）送我去，把我也关起来，认为从此重要人物的车子不会被罚停车票了。想把我关起来。结果我就真去了。这个监狱是个重犯云集的窝点，当然，过去是现在不了。这个监狱有一万个罪犯，只有四百个女性罪犯 — 一万个里面 —九千六百个罪犯是男性，恐怖分子，强奸犯，窃贼，黑帮 —有些还是我亲手捕获的在我作警察的时候。现在我又该怎么对付他们呢？第一天我走进监狱，我都不知道怎么正视他们。我就问他们：“你祈祷么？” 我看着他们，问他们：“你们祈祷么？”他们看着我，一个年轻的小个子女人，一身戎装。我问：“你们祈祷么？”他们什么也没有回答。我又问：“你们每天祈祷么？现在来祈祷怎么样？”他们说：“好的。”我就说：“那好，让我们来祈祷吧。”我为他们祈祷，从那时事情开始有了变化。这是一张在监狱内施教的照片。
en:So I&#39;m going to move on.This is about tough policing, equal policing.Now I was known as &quot;here&#39;s a woman that&#39;s not going to listen.&quot;So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings,postings which others would say no.I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.Normally police officers don&#39;t want to do prison.They sent me to prison to lock me up,thinking, &quot;Now there will be no carsand no VIPs to be given tickets to.Let&#39;s lock her up.&quot;Here I got a prison assignment.This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals.Obviously, it was.But 10,000 men,of which only 400 were women — 10,000 —9,000 plus about 600were men.Terrorists, rapists,burglars, gangsters —some of them I&#39;d sent to jailas a police officer outside.And then how did I deal with them?The first day when I went in,I didn&#39;t know how to look at them.And I said, &quot;Do you pray?&quot; When I looked at the group, I said, &quot;Do you pray?&quot;They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.I said, &quot;Do you pray?&quot;And they didn&#39;t say anything.I said, &quot;Do you pray? Do you want to pray?&quot;They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I said, &quot;All right, let&#39;s pray.&quot;I prayed for them, and things started to change.This is a visual of education inside the prison.

zh-cn:在座的朋友们，这是前所未有的，监狱里的每个人都学习。这是靠着公众支持搞起来的，政府没有资金。这是世界上所有监狱中最好的，最大的志愿者队伍。德里监狱是头一例子。你可以看到一个关于一个囚犯给别人上课的例子。那里有成百上千堂课。九点到十一点，所有的囚犯都来受教育 —正是在这里他们认为把我派到监狱就天下太平了。我们把这个监狱改造成了一个静修之所 —靠着教育。我认为这是个更大的改变。这还只是个开始。这些老师都是囚犯，都是志愿教课的。书都是学校捐的。设备都是靠捐献的。所有的一切都是志愿贡献的。因为对于监狱教育，我们没有任何预算。如果我当初没有这样做，现在这个监狱会成为一个地狱。
en:Friends, this has never happened,where everybody in the prison studies.I started this with community support.Government had no budget.It was one of the finest, largest volunteerismin any prison in the world.This was initiated in Delhi prison.You see one sampleof a prisoner teaching a class.These are hundreds of classes.Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program —the same den in which they thoughtthey would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.We converted this into an ashram —from a prison to an ashram through education.I think that&#39;s the bigger change.It was the beginning of a change.Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.Books came from donated schoolbooks.Stationery was donated.Everything was donated,because there was no budget of education for the prison.Now if I&#39;d not done that,it would have been a hellhole.

zh-cn:这是第二个我要分享的改革。现在我想向你们展示我的历程中的一些片断，恐怕大家在别处是看不到的。一来是你看不到具体数字，二来这些概念也不会被提起。这是一个监狱里的冥想课程，这个监狱有上千的囚犯。一千个囚犯全在静坐冥想。这是我在管理监狱时，实施的最前卫的改革之一。这个改革也在不断进步。如果你感兴趣，请去看这部电影：“铁窗后，静坐冥想”你能了解更多，而且你绝对会喜欢这个电影。或者你也可以给我写信到我的网站（KiranBedi.com），我都会回复大家。让我再给你们看一张幻灯片。我（对警察们）同样运用了正念的力量。因为，为什么我在监狱里推广静坐呢？因为罪行是由恶念引发的。恶念需要被加以控制，而不是靠说教，道听途说，或者阅读，而是靠掌控你自己的意念。我同样向警察们推荐了这个方法，因为警察，同样的，也是他们自己意念的囚徒，警察把世界分成了我们（警察）和他们（罪犯），这样大家就不能一同协作。这个方法在警察身上同样奏效。
en:That&#39;s the second landmark.I want to show you some moments of history in my journey,which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world.One, the numbers you&#39;ll never get to see.Secondly, this concept.This was a meditation program inside the prisonof over 1,000 prisoners.One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation.This was one of the most courageous stepsI took as a prison governor.And this is what transformed.You want to know more about this,go and see this film, &quot;Doing Time, Doing Vipassana.&quot;You will hear about it, and you will love it.And write to me on KiranBedi.com,and I&#39;ll respond to you.Let me show you the next slide.I took the same concept of mindfulness,because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?Because crime is a product of a distorted mind.It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control.Not by preaching, not by telling,not by reading, but by addressing your mind.I took the same thing to the police,because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds,and they felt as if it was &quot;we&quot; and &quot;they,&quot;and that the people don&#39;t cooperate.This worked.

zh-cn:这是个意见箱，叫做“请愿箱”。这是另一个我引进的概念，来听取意见，听取抱怨。这是个魔术箱。这是个感应计。这是罪犯画的关于监狱生活的绘画，如果你看得见那个蓝衣服的人 —就是这个男的 —他是个教师，也是个罪犯。你可以看到每个人都很忙碌，没有时间浪费。
en:This is a feedback box called a petition box.This is a concept which I introducedto listen to complaints, listen to grievances.This was a magic box.This was a sensitive box.This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.If you see somebody in the blue —yeah, this guy —he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher.And you see, everybody&#39;s busy. There was no time to waste.

zh-cn:让我在此说个结束语吧。我现在热衷的很多运动，对于没有足够教育的儿童加强教育，印度有成千上万儿童缺乏教育。在印度很多问题都涉及到数以千计的人口。其次是在印度反腐败的运动。路漫漫其修远兮，作为一小群活动家，我们已经向印度政府起草了申诉专员条例草案。在座的朋友们将会听到很多我们的声音。这是现在我正努力推动的运动，这也是我生命的动力和抱负。
en:Let me wrap it up.I&#39;m currently into movements,movements of educationof the under-served children,which is thousands — India is all about thousands.Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.That&#39;s a big waywe, as a small group of activists,have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.Friends, you will hear a lot about it.That&#39;s the movement at the moment I&#39;m driving,and that&#39;s the movement and ambition of my life.
