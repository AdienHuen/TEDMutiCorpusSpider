zh-cn:2010年12月的一天墨西哥米却肯州沿海城市阿帕兹甘市的人们被枪炮声惊醒在接下来的两天城市变成了战场联邦军队和米可安卡那家族那是一个组织严密的地方黑社会团伙展开了激战这个城市的居民不仅经历了连续不断的枪炮声同时也目睹了无处不在的爆炸和那些用作弹幕的燃烧着的汽车所以跟战场没什么两样经过了两天的战斗一场恶战之后米可安卡那家族传说中的首领Nazario Moreno据信已经战亡
en:In December of 2010,the city of Apatzingánin the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,awoke to gunfire.For two straight days,the city became an open battlefieldbetween the federal forcesand a well-organized group,presumably from the local criminal organization,La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.The citizens didn&#39;t only experience incessant gunfirebut also explosionsand burning trucks used as barricades across the city,so truly like a battlefield.After these two days,and during a particularly intense encounter,it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,Nazario Moreno, was killed.

zh-cn:对于此次可怕的暴力阿帕廷干市市长决定号召市民举行一次呼吁和平的游行想法是呼吁州政府采用更加温和的方式处理犯罪活动于是，在按计划游行的那天上千人走上了街头当市长在准备宣布游行开始前的演讲的时候他们发现参与游行的人中有一半的人穿着得体的白色衣服举着呼吁和平的标语另一半的人实际是为支持之前被打击的犯罪团伙以及据信已经死亡的集团头目来的市长震惊了，回避了放弃了这场表面是为了支持犯罪集团的游行他的团队也集体回避了两支游行队伍汇合了一起继续朝着州政府进发
en:In response to this terrifying violence,the mayor of Apatzingándecided to call the citizens to a march for peace.The idea was to ask for a softer approachto criminal activity in the state.And so, the day of the scheduled procession,thousands of people showed up.As the mayor was preparing to deliverthe speech starting the march,his team noticedthat, while half of the participantswere appropriately dressed in white,and bearing banners asking for peace,the other half was actually marchingin support of the criminal organizationand its now-presumed-defunct leader.Shocked, the mayor decided to step asiderather than participate or lead a processionthat was ostensibly in support of organized crime.And so his team stepped aside.The two marches joined together,and they continued their pathtowards the state capital.

zh-cn:这个骇人的暴力故事是墨西哥如今局势的一个完美缩影联邦政府和地方政府之后采取的笨拙手段是在试图重新控制被犯罪集团控制的社区这让我们意识到我们目前对于毒品暴力犯罪及其成因的理解至少是非常局限的
en:This story of horrific violencefollowed by a fumbled approachby federal and local authorities as they triedto engage civil society,who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,is a perfect metaphor for what&#39;s happening in Mexico today,where we see that our current understandingof drug violence and what leads to itis probably at the very least incomplete.

zh-cn:如果你决定花30分钟时间去调研一下墨西哥现在的毒品暴力现状比如说，在网上搜索一下你会首先发现虽然法律赋予了每个墨西哥公民平等的权利但事实上这些人的生命是有贵贱之分的因为你马上就会发现过去的六年中有6~10万墨西哥人死于跟毒品交易有关的暴力活动客观的看这个数字它是伊拉克和阿富汗伤亡人数总和的八倍这个可怕的数字接近于叙利亚内战的死亡人数一场活跃的内战而这就发生在南部边境
en:If you decided to spend 30 minutes tryingto figure out what&#39;s going on with drug violence in Mexicoby, say, just researching online,the first thing you would find out is thatwhile the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,there are some that are moreand there are some that are much less equal than others,because you will quickly find outthat in the past six yearsanywhere between 60 and 100,000 peoplehave lost their lives in drug-related violence.To put these numbers in perspective,this is eight times larger than the number of casualtiesin the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.It&#39;s also shockingly close to the number of peoplewho have died in the Syrian civil war,which is an active civil war.This is happening just south of the border.

zh-cn:现在你们看到这些数字可能会非常惊讶自己竟然这么快就对这样的死亡数字麻木了因为你们面对的这些都只是抽象的数字数字的背后是已经死去的无名无姓的人或多或少的，人们可能会猜想死掉的那些人都跟毒品交易有些关系我们推断的原因是这些人有的被人用老练的手法折磨过有的被人用熟练的手法杀死多数是兼而有之很明显，这些人死掉的方式透露出他们生前一定是罪犯于是故事就变成了这些人都是自做自受他们都是坏人这个推断让很多的人不会再对这个死亡数字在意
en:Now as you&#39;re reading, however,you will be maybe surprised that you will quicklybecome numb to the numbers of deaths,because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbersof faceless, nameless dead people.Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrativethat all the people who are dyingwere somehow involved in the drug trade,and we infer this because they were either torturedor executed in a professional manner,or, most likely, both.And so clearly they were criminalsbecause of the way they died.And so the narrative is that somehow these peoplegot what they were deserved.They were part of the bad guys.And that creates some form of comfortfor a lot of people.

zh-cn:然而，对我们来说通常会认为我们自己，市民，警察，军队都是好人而那些毒贩子， 黑帮都是坏人但是如果你仔细想想后者不过是为前者提供一种服务而已不管你是否喜欢这个说法美国都是世界上最大的违禁药物消费国消费了超过全球一半的毒品美国跟墨西哥有着上千公里的边界线这是从南部进入美国的唯一途径因此，正如墨西哥过去的统治波菲里奥·迪亚斯曾经感慨过的,“可怜的墨西哥啊&quot;&quot;离上帝如此之远，却离美国如此之近！&quot;
en:However, while it&#39;s easier to thinkof us, the citizens, the police, the army,as the good guys, and them, the narcos,the carteles, as the bad guys,if you think about it,the latter are only providing a service to the former.Whether we like it or not,the U.S. is the largest marketfor illegal substances in the world,accounting for more than half of global demand.It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexicothat is its only route of access from the South,and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,used to say, &quot;Poor Mexico,so far from God and so close to the United States.&quot;

zh-cn:联合国的调查分析表明美国有大约5500万人使用违禁药物即使是非常非常保守的估计由此带来的毒品零售市场的销售额也在 300~1500 亿美元之间如果我们假设毒贩只负责大宗毒品批发的业务当然现实不是这样那么零售市场的销售额依然在150~600亿美元之间做一个直观的比较微软公司每年的年收入也就是600亿美元而这个产品有一个特点这是由它的本质决定的想要做这样的生意你需要保证自己的供货商能够将货物安全可靠的送到最终的消费者手里由于这项生意是违法的，要做到这点唯一的方法就是对毒品运输的边界线实现绝对控制暴力活动也变得理所当然如果你们看过黑帮影响力和暴力活动的分布地图就会发现这些几乎都是发生在穿越南北的那些必经之路上这些黑帮其实也只是想要保护自己的生意
en:The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million usersof illegal drugs in the United States.Using very, very conservative assumptions,this yields a yearly drug market on the retail sideof anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.If we assume that the narcos only have accessto the wholesale part, which we know is false,that still leaves you with yearly revenuesof anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.To put these numbers in perspective,Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.And it so happens that this is a product that,because of its nature, a business modelto address this market requires youto guarantee to your producersthat their product will be reliably placedin the markets where it is consumed.And the only way to do this, because it&#39;s illegal,is to have absolute control of the geographic corridorsthat are used to transport drugs.Hence the violence.If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,you will see that it almost perfectly alignswith the most efficient routes of transportationfrom the south to the north.The only thing that the cartels are doingis that they&#39;re trying to protect their business.

zh-cn:这不仅是一个数百亿美元规模的市场它还有着复杂的运作机制例如， 古柯是一种很脆弱的植物只能生长在特定的纬度这就意味着这个市场的商业模式需要一个遍布全球的分散的生产基地同时也需要对毒品的纯度(品质)有很好的把握因为瘾君子希望能够在他们需要的时候随时能买到好货而货的纯度又不至于把他们毒死这也就意味着他们需要美国南部的安全生产和质量控制同时需要保证有足够快速便捷的物流渠道能够将自己的毒品送到瘾君子手中我鼓励你，但是不要勉强因为我不希望你因此惹上麻烦去四处打听想要随时随地买到自己想要的任何毒品有多么困难在任何时间、在美国的任何地方然后你们中的某些人可能会惊讶于周围居然有那么多的小毒品贩子甚至你发条短信都可以买到毒品而且他们保证能够在30分钟之内送货上门
en:It&#39;s not only a multi-billion dollar market,but it&#39;s also a complex one.For example, the coca plant is a fragile plantthat can only grow in certain latitudes,and so it means that a business modelto address this market requires you to havedecentralized, international production,that by the way needs to have good quality control,because people need a good highthat is not going to kill themand that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.And so that means they need to secureproduction and quality control in the south,and you need to ensure that you haveefficient and effective distribution channelsin the markets where these drugs are consumed.I urge you, but only a little bit,because I don&#39;t want to get you in trouble,to just ask around and see how difficult it would beto get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,and some of you may be surprised to knowthat there are many dealers that offer a servicewhere if you send them a text message,they guarantee delivery of the drugin 30 minutes or less.

zh-cn:现在，我作为一名研究商业行为的教授首先告诉你们一些商业领域公认的结论一个高效的组织必须要有一套整合的战略措施包括良好的组织架构，有效的激励机制严格的品牌和形象管理这是我接下来要告诉你们的第二个事实或许你上网半个小时也能了解得到因为你很快就会发现或许这还会让你感到困惑就是在墨西哥毒品犯罪的相关文章中有三个犯罪集团的名字反复出现你一定会听到&quot;洛斯塞塔斯&quot;&quot;圣殿骑士团&quot;就是我一开始就提到的米克阿卡那家族还有 &quot;锡纳罗亚贩毒集团&quot; 集团你可能会相关文章中得知洛斯塞塔斯是这些团伙中最为残暴的一个他们在渗透过的每一个城市制造恐怖、压制舆论当然，这些多少或者大部分都是真实的但是这些其实都是精细的品牌策略和商业手段的效果洛斯塞塔斯并不简单并不是一群乌合之众的散漫组织它实际上是由另外一个叫做“海湾集团”的犯罪集团创建的这个犯罪集团曾经控制了墨西哥东部运输通道后来运输通道的竞争开始变得激烈他们决定要训练一支专业的武装队伍于是他们训练出了洛斯塞塔斯成员都来自于墨西哥军队的军人由伞兵中的精英组成作为海湾集团意志的执行者，他们的确非常精干直到有一天他们干掉了海湾集团决定自己单干所以我跟你们说， 别把老虎当猫养因为它们迟早会要长大因为洛斯塞塔斯是叛变出来的他们没有办法做可卡因之类的利润丰厚的生意因为他们没法控制生产和分销环节但是他们有自己擅长的源于他们的军队背景他们的命令传达效率非常之高组织结构清晰人员的提拔机制和激励措施很明确这使得他们在多种多样的非法生意中脱颖而出而做这些生意最需要的就是执行力由于他们没有办法插手利润丰厚的毒品市场这迫使他们，也是他们有了机会参与各种各样的犯罪活动包括绑架勒索， 卖淫嫖娼地区毒品零售以及贩卖人口包括从墨西哥偷渡非法移民到美国境内所以他们经营的生意靠的是名副其实的&quot;特许经营权&quot;他们主要从军队吸纳新人他们公开宣扬自己能够提供更多的薪水更好的福利以及更快的晋升途径更不要提吃得也很好比军队能提供的好多了他们手法类似于&quot;黑吃黑&quot;每到一个新的地盘他们先制造点动静让人知道他们来了然后他们去找当地实力最强的黑帮对他们说&quot;我允许你们成为我们洛斯塞塔斯的加盟店&quot;如果当地黑帮同意了——你不会想知道不同意的下场他们就训练和指导当地的黑帮教他们如何在当地高效率的经营各种违法生意用&quot;特许经营权&quot;换取在当地的威望显然，这种商业模式能够成功完全依赖于他们深烙在民众心里的恐惧烙印所以洛斯塞塔斯很推崇骨子里的暴力犯罪但是他们做事之前也会慎重规划尤其是当他们刚刚进入一个城市时再提醒一下，这都是为了树立威望我不是说他们不暴力我说的意思是即使你看到的资料中说他们是最残暴的当你从死亡人数的角度来看所有的黑帮都是一样的
en:Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,an effective organization requiresan integrated strategy that includesa good organizational structure, good incentives,a solid identity and good brand management.This leads me to the second thing that you would learnin your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.Because you would quickly realize,and maybe be confused by the fact,that there are three organizationsthat are constantly named in the articles.You will hear about Los Zetas,the Knights Templar, which is the new brandfor the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,and the Sinaloa Federation.You will read that Los Zetas is this assortmentof sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enterand they silence the press,and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.But this is the result of a very careful brandingand business strategy.You see, Los Zetas is not justthis random assortment of individuals,but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.When that corridor became contested, they decidedthat they wanted to recruita professional enforcement arm.So they recruited Los Zetas:an entire unit of elite paratroopersfrom the Mexican Army.They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,so much so that at some point, they decidedto just take over the operations,which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,because they grow up.Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason,they lost some of the linkages to the production and distributionin the most profitable markets like cocaine,but what they did have,and this is again based on their military origin,was a perfectly structured chain of commandwith a very clear hierarchyand a very clear promotion path that allowed themto supervise and operate across many, many marketsvery effectively,which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.And so because they didn&#39;t have accessto the more profitable drug markets,this pushed them and gave them the opportunityto diversify into other forms of crime.That includes kidnapping, prostitution,local drug dealing and human trafficking,including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.So what they currently run is trulyand quite literally a franchise business.They focus most of their recruiting on the army,and they very openly advertise for better salaries,better benefits, better promotion paths,not to mention much better food,than what the army can deliver.The way they operate is thatwhen they arrive in a locality,they let people know that they are there,and they go to the most powerful local gangand they say, &quot;I offer youto be the local representative of the Zeta brand.&quot;If they agree — and you don&#39;t want to knowwhat happens if they don&#39;t —they train them and they supervise themon how to run the most efficient criminal operationfor that town, in exchange for royalties.This kind of business model obviously dependsentirely on having a very effective brand of fear,and so Los Zetascarefully stage acts of violencethat are spectacular in nature,especially when they arrive first in a city,but again, that&#39;s just a brand strategy.I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re not violent,but what I am saying is that even though you will readthat they are the most violent of all,when you count, when you do the body count,they&#39;re actually all the same.

zh-cn:跟他们相反的是来自米克阿坎的圣殿骑士团实际上是为了抵御洛斯塞塔斯占领米克阿坎市而联合起来的米克阿坎在地理上是战略重地因为她拥有墨西哥最大的港口之一同时拥有一条交通枢纽可以直达墨西哥中部提供了到达美国的直接通道圣殿骑士团很快就意识到他们单打独斗是干不过洛斯塞塔斯的他们摸索出一种新策略把自己改造成公益企业的样子他们标榜自己是米克阿坎市民的代表和保护者保护市民，抵御其它帮派的有组织的犯罪他们标榜的公益事业要求他们需要在改善市民生活方面投入很多力量所以他们在当地公共服务上大把的投入像是处理家庭暴力侦破某些类型的犯罪，强制戒毒并禁止毒品进入他们占据的当地市场上并且，理所当然的，保护当地人免受其它黑社会的骚扰现在, 他们也杀了很多的人但是他们杀人的时候会小心的准备一份&quot;杀人声明&quot;或&quot;故事背景&quot;解释为什么要杀这些人他们会在报纸上，YouTube 上以及室外广告牌上解释：他们是杀了人但他们杀人是因为那些死者显然对当地群众造成了威胁而不是对他们自己造成了威胁所以实际上&quot;我们是来保护你们的&quot;就像是别的公益企业一样他们有自己的道德准则和伦理信条并且广为宣扬对这些准则的遵守也近于苛刻现在你们已经知道了他们如何解释他们的某些类型的(犯罪)行为的他们有效的控制了毒品交易这一暴利行业但他们的做法有些独特，他们完全控制了米克阿坎市又控制了拉萨罗·卡德纳斯港口基于这些条件，他们的生意模式类似于从米克阿坎出口合法生产和出口的黄铜到中国非法的从中国带回来麻黄碱这是制作冰毒的重要原材料他们制作出来冰毒之后，通过跟锡纳罗亚贩毒集团这样的更大的组织合作将自己的产品投放到美国市场
en:In contrast to them, the Knights Templarthat arose in Michoacánemerged in reaction to the incursionof the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.Michoacán is a geographically strategic statebecause it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,which then gives you direct access to the U.S.The Knights Templar realized very quicklythat they couldn&#39;t face the Zetas on violence alone,and so they developed a strategyas a social enterprise.They brand themselves as representative ofand protecting of the citizens of Michoacánagainst organized crime.Their brand of social enterprise meansthat they require a lot of civic engagement,so they invest heavily in providing local services,like dealing with home violence,going after petty criminals, treating addicts,and keeping drugs out of the local marketswhere they are,and, of course, protecting peoplefrom other criminal organizations.Now, they kill a lot of people too,but when they kill them,they provide very careful narratives and descriptionsfor why they did them,through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,and billboards that explain that the people who were killedwere killed because they represented a threatnot to us, as an organization, of course,but to you, as citizens.And so we&#39;re actually here to protect you.They, as social enterprises do,have created a moral and ethical codethat they advertise around,and they have very strict recruiting practices.And here you have the types of explanationsthat they provide for some of their actions.They have actually retained accessto the profitable drug trade,but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán,and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas,they leverage that to, for example,trade copper from Michoacán that is legally createdand legally extractedwith illegal ephedrine from Chinawhich is a critical precursor for methamphetaminesthat they produce, and then they have partnershipswith larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federationthat place their products in the U.S.

zh-cn:最后一个是锡纳罗亚贩毒集团当你阅读介绍他们的文章时你时常可以感受到文章隐含的敬畏和赞赏之意因为这个组织是墨西哥最大的一个组织也是经营范围最全的一个组织很多人都觉得这是世界上最大的组织这个组织一开始只是一个搞搞货运的小团队专门在墨西哥和美国之间做点走私的行当但是现在他们已经成长成为一个真正的跨国多元化集团与南方各国的(毒品)生产国有合作关系建立了合作关系的分销网络遍布全球他们培养出来的组织文化包含了专业精神、商业智慧和创新他们研发了新的毒品改进了毒品制造工艺他们挖出了一条毒品管道能够穿越美国边境你们看到了这个管道跟”肖申克的救赎“里面的管道可不一样他们发明了能够躲避雷达的潜水艇和船只来运送毒品他们还发明了用无人机来送货还有弹弓……应有尽有事实上锡纳罗亚贩毒集团的领导人之一还让自己上了福布斯富豪榜
en:Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.When you read about them, you will often read about themwith an undertone of reverence and admiration,because they are the most integratedand the largest of all the Mexican organizations,and, many people argue, the world.They started as just sort of a transport organizationthat specialized in smuggling between the U.S.and the Mexican borders,but now they have growninto a truly integrated multinationalthat has partnerships in production in the southand partnerships in global distributionacross the planet.They have cultivated a brand of professionalism,business acumen and innovation.They have designed new drug productsand new drug processes.They have designed narco-tunnelsthat go across the border,and you can see that these are not&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; types.They have invented narco-submarines and boatsthat are not detected by radar.They have invented drones to transport drugs,catapults, you name it.One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federationactually made it to the Forbes list.

en:Like any multinational would, they have specializedand focused only in the most profitable part of the business,which is high-margin drugs like cocaine,heroine, methamphetamines.Like any traditional Latin American multinational would,the way they control their operationsis through family ties.When they&#39;re entering a new market, they senda family member to supervise it,or, if they&#39;re partnering with a new organization,they create a family tie,either through marriages or other types of ties.Like any other multinational would,they protect their brand by outsourcingthe more questionable parts of the business model,like for example, when they have to engagein violence against other criminal organizations,they recruit gangs and other smaller playersto do the dirty work for them,and they try to separate their operationsand their violence and be very discrete about this.

zh-cn:所以我希望你们在听完这次演讲后能够记住三件事情第一件事情是毒品暴力犯罪是强大的市场需求推动的结果为了保证毒品的销售渠道畅通需要有一个强大的组织支持暴力不可避免第二点是他们的组织结构都非常复杂内部非常紧密他们实际上是商业组织从这点出发来分析和打击他们或许会有更好的效果我想说的第三件事情是即使我们非常习惯于称呼这些组织称呼为&quot;他们&quot;把他们看作远离我们的一群坏蛋但是实际上我们是他们的同伙要么是通过对毒品的直接消费要么是通过你对毒品的接受或容忍在法律法规禁止吸毒的同时我们却能包容甚至鼓励吸毒行为
en:And so what I want you to remember from this talkare three things.The first one is that drug violenceis actually the resultof a huge market demandand an institutional setup that forcesthe servicing of this market to necessitate violenceto guarantee delivery routes.The second thing I want you to rememberis that these are sophisticated,coherent organizationsthat are business organizations,and analyzing them and treating them as suchis probably a much more useful approach.The third thing I want you to rememberis that even though we&#39;re more comfortablewith this idea of &quot;them,&quot;a set of bad guys separated from us,we are actually accomplices to them,either through our direct consumptionor through our acceptance of the inconsistencybetween our policies of prohibitionand our actual behavior of toleranceor even encouragement of consumption.

en:These organizations service, recruit from,and operate within our communities,so necessarily, they are much more integratedwithin them than we are comfortable acknowledging.And so to me the question is not whetherthese dynamics will continue the way they have.We see that the nature of this phenomenonguarantees that they will.The question is whether we are willing to continueour support of a failed strategybased on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignoranceat the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.
