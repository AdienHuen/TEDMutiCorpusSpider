zh-cn:我是一名生态学家，主要是珊瑚礁生态学家。我的研究工作起步于Chesapeake海湾我冬天出去潜水一夜之间成为一名热带生态学家这项工作充满了乐趣前后大约十年我是说，有人付钱让你四处旅行欣赏地球上风景最美的地方那就是我的工作。
en:I&#39;m an ecologist,mostly a coral reef ecologist.I started out in Chesapeake Bayand went diving in the winterand became a tropical ecologist overnight.And it was really a lot of funfor about 10 years.I mean, somebody pays youto go around and traveland look at some of the mostbeautiful places on the planet.And that was what I did.

zh-cn:最后我到了牙买加在西印度群岛那儿的珊瑚礁的确是结构上最为奇特的为我平生所罕见这张照片很有意思，它显示了两点。首先，它是黑白的因为水是如此清澈你可以看得很远曝光很慢那是六十年代和七十年代早期照片都是黑白的它显示的另外一点纵然有这些美丽的珊瑚丛照片上却看不到鱼
en:And I ended up in Jamaica,in the West Indies,where the coral reefs were reallyamong the most extraordinary, structurally,that I ever saw in my life.And this picture here,it&#39;s really interesting, it shows two things:First of all, it&#39;s in black and whitebecause the water was so clearand you could see so far,and film was so slowin the 1960s and early 70s,you took pictures in black and white.The other thing it shows youis that, although there&#39;s this beautifulforest of coral,there are no fish in that picture.

zh-cn:牙买加 Discovery湾的那些珊瑚礁是全球过去的20年中最受研究者关注的珊瑚礁当时我们是最优秀最杰出的曾经有人从澳大利亚跑来研究我们的珊瑚礁这多少有些滑稽因为现在我们跑去研究他们的珊瑚礁科学家们关于珊瑚礁的正常生长状态的观点都建立在这些不存在鱼类的珊瑚礁上然后，到了1980年一场飓风袭来，飓风Allen我把半个实验室搬到了我家里狂风大作海浪高达25到50英尺珊瑚礁消失了，新的岛屿形成了我们想，“哦，我们真是太聪明了。我们知道飓风历来都在发生。”我们在《科学》杂志发表了一篇论文那是第一次有人描述珊瑚礁被一场大飓风毁灭的情景我们对未来作出了预测结果我们全盘皆错原因就是过度捕捞还有就是最后一个食藻生物海胆死了海胆死后几个月之内海藻就开始生长那是同一个珊瑚礁15年前的那个珊瑚礁这是今天的同一个珊瑚礁牙买加北海岸的珊瑚礁还剩下百分之几的活珊瑚覆盖率和大量的海藻及烂泥这大致就是加勒比海珊瑚礁的故事并悲剧性地日益成为全球珊瑚礁共同的命运
en:Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaicawere the most studied coral reefsin the world for 20 years.We were the best and the brightest.People came to study our reefs from Australia,which is sort of funnybecause now we go to theirs.And the view of scientistsabout how coral reefs work, how they ought to be,was based on these reefswithout any fish.Then, in 1980,there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen.I put half the labup in my house.The wind blew very strong.The waves were 25to 50 feet high.And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed,and we thought, &quot;Well, we&#39;re real smart.We know that hurricaneshave always happened in the past.&quot;And we published a paper in Science,the first time that anybody everdescribed the destructionon a coral reef by a major hurricane.And we predicted what would happen,and we got it all wrong.And the reason wasbecause of overfishing,and the fact that a last common grazer,a sea urchin, died.And within a few monthsafter that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow.And that is the same reef;that&#39;s the same reef 15 years ago;that&#39;s the same reef today.The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaicahave a few percent live coral coverand a lot of seaweed and slime.And that&#39;s more or less the storyof the coral reefs of the Caribbean,and increasingly, tragically,the coral reefs worldwide.

zh-cn:这就是我悲伤的小故事我们所有的人在六七十年代都有类似悲伤的故事成千上万个这样的故事在流传着让人很难唤起任何乐观的情绪因为情况在日益恶化日益恶化的原因是在自然灾害过后例如一场飓风以前通常会有一连串的恢复过程但现在的情况是过度捕捞、污染和气候变化彼此相互作用阻止这一过程的发生因此我想梳理并谈论一下这三件事情
en:Now, that&#39;s my little, depressing story.All of us in our 60s and 70shave comparable depressing stories.There are tens of thousandsof those stories out there,and it&#39;s really hard to conjure upmuch of a sense of well-being,because it just keeps getting worse.And the reason it keeps getting worseis that after a natural catastrophe,like a hurricane,it used to be that there wassome kind of successional sequence of recovery,but what&#39;s going on now is thatoverfishing and pollution and climate changeare all interactingin a way that prevents that.And so I&#39;m going to sort of go throughand talk about those threekinds of things.

zh-cn:我们经常听到关于鳕鱼的灭绝我们很难想象两次，有些历史学家说三次殖民时期的世界大战都是为了争夺对鳕鱼的控制鳕鱼养活了大部分西欧人也养活了被遣送到安地列斯群岛上的奴隶有首歌叫“告别牙买加”&quot;阿开果饭和咸鳕鱼很美味”表明了来自加拿大东北部的咸鳕鱼的重要性这一切都在八十和九十年代土崩瓦解35000人丢掉了工作那仅仅是一系列枯竭的开始从味道鲜美的大型种类到味道一般的小型种类从家门口的种类到全球各地的种类你还剩下什么。这可能不容易理解因为你们可以在美国的Costco买到便宜的鱼你们应该阅读一下标签看它来自何处但鱼还是很便宜所有人都觉得没事
en:We hear a lot aboutthe collapse of cod.It&#39;s difficult to imagine thattwo, or some historians would say three world warswere fought during the colonial erafor the control of cod.Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.It fed the slavesbrought to the Antilles,the song &quot;Jamaica Farewell&quot; —&quot;Ackee rice salt fish are nice&quot; —is an emblem of the importanceof salt cod from northeastern Canada.It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:35,000 people lost their jobs.And that was the beginningof a kind of serial depletionfrom bigger and tastier speciesto smaller and not-so-tasty species,from species that were near to hometo species that were all around the world,and what have you.It&#39;s a little hard to understand that,because you can go to a Costco in the United Statesand buy cheap fish.You ought to read the label to find out where it came from,but it&#39;s still cheap,and everybody thinks it&#39;s okay.

zh-cn:这个信息很难传达因此我认为一种有趣的方式是讨论一下垂钓运动因为人们喜欢出去钓鱼就像这个照片上显示的是获胜的鱼人们钓到的最大的鱼有人花了很多钱开着船来到福罗里达州 Key West 附近的一个地方喝很多啤酒往水里扔一大堆鱼钩和鱼线结果钓到了最大最好的鱼获奖的这条冠军鱼就被摆到船上， 让人拍照显然这个家伙对那条鱼激动万分好了，那就是眼下的情景但这个是五十年代的情景同样的船同样的地方同一个码头同一个船舷获胜的鱼是那么大那些小鱼根本没法比。获胜的鱼的平均重量在250到300磅之间，巨型鲈鱼你如果想外出捕捞点什么你几乎肯定可以捕到一条那样的鱼而且味道极其鲜美人们在1950年捕捞大鱼所花的钱比现在抓小鱼所花的钱还少到处都是如此
en:It&#39;s hard to communicate this,and one way that I think is really interestingis to talk about sport fish,because people like to go out and catch fish.It&#39;s one of those things.This picture here shows the trophy fish,the biggest fish caughtby people who pay a lot of moneyto get on a boat,go to a place off of Key West in Florida,drink a lot of beer,throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water,come back with the biggest and the best fish,and the champion trophy fishare put on this board, where people take a picture,and this guy is obviouslyreally excited about that fish.Well, that&#39;s what it&#39;s like now,but this is what it was like in the 1950sfrom the same boat in the same placeon the same board on the same dock.The trophy fishwere so bigthat you couldn&#39;t put any of those small fish up on it.And the average size trophy fishweighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper,and if you wanted to go out and kill something,you could pretty much count onbeing able to catch one of those fish.And they tasted really good.And people paid less in 1950 dollarsto catch thatthan what people pay nowto catch those little, tiny fish.And that&#39;s everywhere.

zh-cn:不仅仅是鱼类正在消失工业化捕捞用的是大家伙大机器我们使用20英里长的渔网极长的鱼线带有100万到200万个鱼钩我们使用拖网那就是说使用一个牵引式挂车那么大的东西重达几千磅挂上巨大的链子从海底横扫而过翻起海床来捕捉鱼类可以把这想象成推倒一座城市或者一个森林因为一切被一扫而光那种栖息地的灭绝简直令人难以置信这是一张照片一张典型的照片显示了全球大陆架的状况你们可以看到底部的条纹就好象你们能看到刚被犁过的玉米地那里曾经是海绵和珊瑚丛那是鱼类生长至关重要的栖息地现在却成了泥土全球海底从丛林变为停车场式泥地的海域相当于人类历史上被砍伐的全球的所有森林的面积。这一点我们是在过去100到150年间完成的
en:It&#39;s not just the fish, though,that are disappearing.Industrial fishing uses big stuff,big machinery.We use nets that are 20 miles long.We use longlinesthat have one million or two million hooks.And we trawl,which means to take somethingthe size of a tractor trailer truckthat weighs thousands and thousands of pounds,put it on a big chain,and drag it across the sea floorto stir up the bottom and catch the fish.Think of it asbeing kind of the bulldozing of a cityor of a forest,because it clears it away.And the habitat destructionis unbelievable.This is a photograph,a typical photograph,of what the continental shelvesof the world look like.You can see the rows in the bottom,the way you can see the rowsin a field that has just been plowedto plant corn.What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral,which is a critical habitatfor the development of fish.What it is now is mud,and the area of the ocean floorthat has been transformed from forestto level mud, to parking lot,is equivalent to the entire areaof all the foreststhat have ever been cut downon all of the earthin the history of humanity.We&#39;ve managed to do thatin the last 100 to 150 years.

zh-cn:我们总是想到石油泄漏或者水银现在人们也经常谈论塑料制品所有这些都很可恨但真正隐伏的危险是生物污染来源于它对整个生态系统造成的巨大的变迁我只想简要地讨论两种生物污染一是入侵物种另外一个来源于营养素这就是臭名昭著的杉叶蕨藻所谓的致命海藻有整整一本书写的就是这个实在是令人尴尬它在偶然之间被从摩纳哥的一个水族馆释放出来它耐寒性强用于装点水族馆非常漂亮它开始迅速地过度生长侵占了一度生物种类繁多的地中海西北部我不知道你们中间有多少人记得这部电影&quot;异形奇花”这就是&quot;异形奇花”中的植物它没有吞噬小店里的人们而是疯狂生长扼杀了几乎所有的海底生物遍及整个地中海西北部我们还未发现能够消灭它的东西我们在尝试各种基因工程来寻找解决办法但是，就目前来说，它就是来自地狱的恶魔人们对它无能为力
en:We tend to think of oil spillsand mercuryand we hear a lot about plastic these days.And all of that stuff is really disgusting,but what&#39;s really insidiousis the biological pollution that happensbecause of the magnitude of the shiftsthat it causesto entire ecosystems.And I&#39;m going to just talk very brieflyabout two kinds of biological pollution:one is introduced speciesand the other is what comes from nutrients.So this is the infamousCaulerpa taxifolia,the so-called killer algae.A book was written about it.It&#39;s a bit of an embarrassment.It was accidentally releasedfrom the aquarium in Monaco,it was bred to be cold tolerantto have in peoples aquaria.It&#39;s very pretty,and it has rapidly startedto overgrowthe once very richbiodiversity of thenorthwestern Mediterranean.I don&#39;t know how many of you remember the movie&quot;The Little Shop of Horrors,&quot;but this is the plant of &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors.&quot;But, instead of devouring the people in the shop,what it&#39;s doing is overgrowingand smotheringvirtually all of the bottom-dwelling lifeof the entire northwesternMediterranean Sea.We don&#39;t know anything that eats it,we&#39;re trying to do all sorts of geneticsand figure out something that could be done,but, as it stands, it&#39;s the monster from hell,about which nobody knows what to do.

zh-cn:现在我们来看另一种污染生物污染来源于过量的营养素绿色革命让我们过度使用人工氮肥政府补助，是我们过度使用的原因之一它沿河流而下被浮游生物吸食就是那些极小的植物细胞生长于沿海水域但是由于我们吃光了所有的牡蛎和所有吞食这些浮游生物的鱼类没有生物再去吞食这些浮游生物所以它们越长越多直到自然死亡对浮游生物来说这是前所未有的死亡后它沉入水底然后腐烂这就意味着细菌会将它分解在此过程中它们耗尽了所有的氧气在所有的氧气被耗尽之后就给任何无法游走的生物造成一个完全致命的环境最后我们所得到的就是一个微生物动物园被细菌所控制还有水母，你们看在你们的左前方仅存的一个渔场商业渔场是个水母渔场再看你们的右边，曾经有过对虾甚至在纽芬兰岛我们曾经捕捞鳕鱼的地方现在也有一个水母渔场
en:Now another form of pollutionthat&#39;s biological pollutionis what happens from excess nutrients.The green revolution,all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.It&#39;s subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.It runs down the rivers,and it feeds the plankton,the little microscopic plant cellsin the coastal water.But since we ate all the oystersand we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton,there&#39;s nothing to eat the planktonand there&#39;s more and more of it,so it dies of old age,which is unheard of for plankton.And when it dies, it falls to the bottomand then it rots,which means that bacteria break it down.And in the processthey use up all the oxygen,and in using up all the oxygenthey make the environment utterly lethalfor anything that can&#39;t swim away.So, what we end up withis a microbial zoodominated by bacteriaand jellyfish, as you seeon the left in front of you.And the only fishery left —and it is a commercial fishery —is the jellyfish fisheryyou see on the right, where there used to be prawns.Even in Newfoundlandwhere we used to catch cod,we now have a jellyfish fishery.

en:And another version of this sort of thingis what is often called red tidesor toxic blooms.That picture on the left is just staggering to me.I have talked about it a million times,but it&#39;s unbelievable.In the upper right of that picture on the leftis almost the Mississippi Delta,and the lower left of that pictureis the Texas-Mexico border.You&#39;re looking at the entirenorthwestern Gulf of Mexico;you&#39;re looking at one toxicdinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish,made by that beautiful little creatureon the lower right.And in the upper right you see thisblack sort of cloudmoving ashore.That&#39;s the same species.And as it comes to shore and the wind blows,and little droplets of the water get into the air,the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill upwith people with acute respiratory distress.And that&#39;s retirement homeson the west coast of Florida.A friend and I did this thing in Hollywoodwe called Hollywood ocean night,and I was trying to figure out how toexplain to actors what&#39;s going on.And I said,&quot;So, imagine you&#39;re in a movie called &#39;Escape from Malibu&#39;because all the beautiful people have movedto North Dakota, where it&#39;s clean and safe.And the only people who are left thereare the people who can&#39;t affordto move away from the coast,because the coast, instead of being paradise,is harmful to your health.&quot;

zh-cn:这又是触目惊心。这是我去年初秋在法国度假时拍的这是布里特尼海岸被覆盖在一片绿色海藻泥下它之所以引起这么多关注的原因除了它确实极其恶心之外也是因为海鸟飞过时因臭味窒息而亡有一个农民也这样死去，你们可以想象有此而滋生的丑闻一场战争在农民和渔夫之间爆发最后的结果是布里特尼海滩必须定期地铲除这些东西
en:And then this is amazing.It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.This is from the coast of Brittany,which is being envelopedin this green, algal slime.The reason that it attracted so much attention,besides the fact that it&#39;s disgusting,is that sea birds flying over itare asphyxiated by the smell and die,and a farmer died of it,and you can imagine the scandal that happened.And so there&#39;s this warbetween the farmersand the fishermen about it all,and the net result is thatthe beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuffon a regular basis.

zh-cn:当然还有气候变化我们都知道气候变化我想最具标志性的形象就是就是北极海域冰层的融化想想那成千上万个为寻找西北航道而死去的人们现在西北航道就在那里我觉得这有点滑稽它地处西伯利亚海岸也许俄国政府应当征收过路费全世界的政府都在严肃对待这件事情北极附近国家的军队都在严肃对待这件事情不管各国领导人如何否认气候变化美国中情局挪威海军美国和加拿大的海军，等等都在忙着考虑如何从他们的角度在这个无法避免的情势下守住自己的地盘当然，北极群落就完蛋了
en:And then, of course, there&#39;s climate change,and we all know about climate change.I guess the iconic figure of itis the melting of the icein the Arctic Sea.Think about the thousands and thousands of people who diedtrying to find the Northwest Passage.Well, the Northwest Passage is already there.I think it&#39;s sort of funny;it&#39;s on the Siberian coast,maybe the Russians will charge tolls.The governments of the worldare taking this really seriously.The military of the Arctic nationsis taking it really seriously.For all the denial of climate changeby government leaders,the CIAand the navies of Norwayand the U.S. and Canada, whateverare busily thinking abouthow they will secure their territoryin this inevitabilityfrom their point of view.And, of course, Arctic communities are toast.

zh-cn:气候变化的其它效应—这是珊瑚白化。右边，是一张美丽的照片那么多白色的珊瑚只不过它们本来应该是棕色的。事情的来由是珊瑚是一种共生生物有些微小的藻类细胞生存在其内部藻类为珊瑚提供糖分珊瑚为藻类提供养分和保护但当温度过高时藻类就无法制造糖分珊瑚就说，”你这个骗子，你不交房租。“于是就把它们赶出去，于是它们就死了。不是所有都死；有些存活下来了。还有更多的在存活着，但这确实是个坏消息。让我试着帮助你们来感知一下，想象你七月份去露营在欧洲或者北美的什么地方第二天早上醒来，你环顾四周，发现百分之八十的树在你视线所及范围内都已经掉光了树叶，光秃秃地立在那儿你回到家，发现北美和欧洲百分之八十的树都已经掉光了它们的叶子然后几个星期之后你在报纸上看到噢，顺便说一下，四分之一的树都死了。那就是印度洋所发生的状况在1998年厄尔尼诺现象过程中，在一个面积大大超过北美和欧洲的区域百分之八十的珊瑚发生了白化四分之一珊瑚死去。
en:The other kinds of effects of climate change —this is coral bleaching. It&#39;s a beautiful picture, right?All that white coral.Except it&#39;s supposed to be brown.What happens is thatthe corals are a symbiosis,and they have these little algal cellsthat live inside them.And the algae give the corals sugar,and the corals give the algaenutrients and protection.But when it gets too hot,the algae can&#39;t make the sugar.The corals say, &quot;You cheated. You didn&#39;t pay your rent.&quot;They kick them out, and then they die.Not all of them die; some of them survive,some more are surviving,but it&#39;s really bad news.To try and give you a sense of this,imagine you go camping in Julysomewhere in Europe or in North America,and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you,and you see that 80 percent of the trees,as far as you can see,have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked.And you come home, and you discoverthat 80 percent of all the treesin North America and in Europehave dropped their leaves.And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,&quot;Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died.&quot;Well, that&#39;s what happened in the Indian Oceanduring the 1998 El Nino,an area vastly greaterthan the size of North America and Europe,when 80 percent of all the corals bleachedand a quarter of them died.

zh-cn:然而真正可怕的事情是所有这些过度捕捞，污染，和气候变化每件事都并非发生在真空里，但是因为存在着所谓的积极反馈它们之间的协同作用使得整体效应远远大于局部的总和。最大的科学挑战对于象我这样思考这些问题的人就是我们是否知道如何把摔碎的蛋形人重新修复？我是说，因为我们现在还可以保护它。但那意味着什么？我们真的不知道
en:And then the really scary thingabout all of this —the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change —is that each thing doesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum.But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks,the synergies among themthat make the whole vastly greaterthan the sum of the parts.And the great scientific challengefor people like me in thinking about all this,is do we know howto put Humpty Dumpty back together again?I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it.But what does that mean?We really don&#39;t know.

en:So what are the oceans going to be likein 20 or 50 years?Well, there won&#39;t be any fishexcept for minnows,and the water will be pretty dirty,and all those kinds of thingsand full of mercury, etc., etc.And dead zones will get bigger and biggerand they&#39;ll start to merge,and we can imagine something likethe dead-zonificationof the global, coastal ocean.Then you sure won&#39;t want to eat fish that were raised in it,because it would be a kind ofgastronomic Russian roulette.Sometimes you have a toxic bloom;sometimes you don&#39;t.That doesn&#39;t sell.

zh-cn:但是真正可怕的是正在发生的物理的，化学的和海洋学的变化。当海洋表面温度升高，海水变轻，海洋变得越来越不易翻转。我们称之为越来越严重的层化其后果是所有的养分那些供给大型鳀鱼渔场，加州沙丁渔场，秘鲁或其它地方渔场的养分都放慢了速度，那些渔场就倒闭了。同时表面氧气充足的海水无法下沉，海洋就变成了沙漠。
en:The really scary things thoughare the physical, chemical,oceanographic things that are happening.As the surface of the ocean gets warmer,the water is lighter when it&#39;s warmer,it becomes harder and harderto turn the ocean over.We say it becomesmore strongly stratified.The consequence of that is thatall those nutrientsthat fuel the great anchoveta fisheries,of the sardines of Californiaor in Peru or whatever,those slow downand those fisheries collapse.And, at the same time,water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen,doesn&#39;t make it downand the ocean turns into a desert.

zh-cn:因此问题是：我们应该如何对此作出应对？我们可以做各种事情来进行补救，但最终，我们最需要补救的是我们自己。这不是鱼，不是污染；也不是气候变化。而是我们自己。我们的贪婪和对增长的需求以及我们无法想象一个不同于我们今天所生活的自私的世界。问题在于：我们是否将对此作出应对？我要说生命的未来和人类的尊严取决于我们作出回应。
en:So the question is: How are we allgoing to respond to this?And we can doall sorts of things to fix it,but in the final analysis,the thing we really need to fixis ourselves.It&#39;s not about the fish; it&#39;s not about the pollution;it&#39;s not about the climate change.It&#39;s about usand our greed and our need for growthand our inability to imagine a worldthat is different from the selfish worldwe live in today.So the question is: Will we respond to this or not?I would say that the future of lifeand the dignity of human beingsdepends on our doing that.
