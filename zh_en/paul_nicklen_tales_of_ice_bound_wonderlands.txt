zh-cn:我成为极地专家极地摄影师的旅程始于我四岁那年当时我一家人从加拿大南部搬到了格陵兰岛以北的巴芬岛我们与因纽特人生活在一起在一个两百人的因纽特社区内除了我们以外只有另外两个非因纽特家庭在这里，我们没有电视机没有电脑，当然，也没有收音机甚至连电话都没有我一天到晚都在户外与因纽特人玩耍冰和雪就是我的沙池因纽特人就是我的老师我就是这样深深地迷恋上了这片极地世界我知道总有一天我将向世人分享这片土地的故事从而保护它
en:My journey to become a polar specialist,photographing, specializingin the polar regions,began when I was four years old,when my family moved from southern Canadato Northern Baffin Island,up by Greenland.There we lived with the Inuitin the tiny Inuit communityof 200 Inuit people,where [we] were oneof three non-Inuit families.And in this community,we didn&#39;t have a television;we didn&#39;t have computers,obviously, radio.We didn&#39;t even have a telephone.All of my time was spent outsidewith the Inuit, playing.The snow and the ice were my sandbox,and the Inuit were my teachers.And that&#39;s where I becametruly obsessed with this polar realm.And I knew someday thatI was going to do somethingthat had to do with tryingto share news about itand protect it.

en:I&#39;d like to share with you,for just two minutes only,some images, a cross-section of my work,to the beautiful musicby Brandi Carlile, &quot;Have You Ever.&quot;I don&#39;t know why National Geographichas done this, they&#39;ve never done this before,but they&#39;re allowing meto show you a few imagesfrom a coverage that I&#39;ve just completedthat is not published yet.National Geographic doesn&#39;t do this,so I&#39;m very excited to be ableto share this with you.

en:And what these images are —you&#39;ll see them at the start of the slide show —there&#39;s only about four images —but it&#39;s of a little bearthat lives in the Great Bear Rainforest.It&#39;s pure white,but it&#39;s not a polar bear.It&#39;s a spirit bear,or a Kermode bear.There are only 200 of these bears left.They&#39;re more rare than the panda bear.

zh-cn:我在这条河边整整蹲了两个月都没有看见一只我心想，我的饭碗就此砸了我向国家地理杂志提出了这个愚蠢的建议我当时是不是脑子进水了？于是在那里蹲点的两个月里我一直在琢磨我的下半生该如何度过我不能再当摄影师了，他们肯定会炒了我国家地理是一本杂志；他们时刻提醒我们他们刊登的是图片，不是借口
en:I sat there on the riverfor two months without seeing one.I thought, my career&#39;s over.I proposed this stupid storyto National Geographic.What in the heck was I thinking?So I had two months to sit thereand figure out different waysof what I was going to do in my next life,after I was a photographer,because they were going to fire me.Because National Geographic is a magazine;they remind us all the time:they publish pictures, not excuses.

en:And after two months of sitting there —one day, thinking that it was all over,this incredible big white male came down,right beside me, three feet away from me,and he went down and grabbed a fishand went off in the forest and ate it.And then I spent the entire dayliving my childhood dreamof walking around with this bearthrough the forest.He went through this old-growth forestand sat up beside this 400-year-oldculturally modified tree and went to sleep.And I actually got to sleepwithin three feet of him,just in the forest, and photograph him.

zh-cn:关于冰川逐渐消失的新闻总是不绝于耳而现存的冰川已经岌岌可危实际上，科学家们原本预测冰川将在未来的100年内消失殆尽，后来他们又说是50年而现在，他们认为极地冰川的寿命只剩下4到10年了这意味着什么？如果你只把这看做是新闻，那它永远只能是新闻了你看过了就忘了而我的工作就是力求引起人们的关注我希望人们理解并明白其中的涵义如果冰川消失了我们的整个生态系统中就会一步步恶化我们可能再也见不到北极熊它们会在未来的50至100年后灭绝
en:We&#39;re inundated with news all the timethat the sea ice is disappearingand it&#39;s at its lowest level.And in fact, scientistswere originally sayingsea ice is going to disappearin the next hundred years, then they said 50 years.Now they&#39;re sayingthe sea ice in the Arctic,the summertime extent is going to be gonein the next four to 10 years.And what does that mean?After a while of reading this in the news,it just becomes news.You glaze over with it.And what I&#39;m trying to dowith my work is put faces to this.And I want people to understandand get the conceptthat, if we lose ice,we stand to lose an entire ecosystem.Projections are that we couldlose polar bears, they could become extinctin the next 50 to 100 years.

zh-cn:还有什么比这种美妙绝伦的巨型动物更性感，更值得我为保护它而奔走的呢北极熊是功夫精湛的猎手有一段时间，我在海岸边跟踪这只熊这里附近没有冰一座冰川崩塌后，一只海豹爬了上来这只熊便奋力游向那只海豹－－那是只800磅重的海豹－－它把海豹擒住，游回原地，大快朵颐它饱餐了一顿，非常开心，吃得肚子鼓鼓的当我慢慢靠近它－－大约20英尺左右－－给它拍照它也顾不上理会我，而接着吃那海豹它吃啊吃，吃得那么饱－－它大约把200磅肉吃下肚里它嘴里一边嚼着把肉咽下去一边把食物反刍到嘴的另一侧
en:And there&#39;s no better, sexier,more beautiful,charismatic megafauna speciesfor me to hang my campaign on.Polar bears are amazing hunters.This was a bear I sat withfor a while on the shores.There was no ice around.But this glacier caved into the waterand a seal got on it.And this bear swam out to that seal —800 lb. bearded seal —grabbed it, swam back and ate it.And he was so full,he was so happy and so fat eating this seal,that, as I approached him —about 20 feet away —to get this picture,his only defense was to keep eating more seal.And as he ate, he was so full —he probably had about200 lbs of meat in his belly —and as he ate insideone side of his mouth,he was regurgitatingout the other side of his mouth.

zh-cn:只要还有一点冰存在，北极熊就能生存下来但是现在，冰不停地融化我们在北极看到越来越多死去的北极熊20年前，我作为生物学家研究北极熊的时候我们从来没有发现死熊而在过去的四五年里熊的尸体随处可见我们看到它们在波弗特海上无助地漂流，这里的冰全部融化了我去年在挪威见过几只死熊。冰上也有它们的尸体这些死去的北极熊反映了冰川融化的严重后果
en:So as long as these bearshave any bit of ice they will survive,but it&#39;s the ice that&#39;s disappearing.We&#39;re finding more and moredead bears in the Arctic.When I worked on polar bearsas a biologist 20 years ago,we never found dead bears.And in the last four or five years,we&#39;re finding dead bearspopping up all over the place.We&#39;re seeing them in the Beaufort Sea,floating in the open oceanwhere the ice has melted out.I found a couple in Norway last year.We&#39;re seeing them on the ice.These bears are already showing signsof the stress of disappearing ice.

en:Here&#39;s a mother and her two year-old cubwere traveling on a ship a hundred milesoffshore in the middle of nowhere,and they&#39;re ridingon this big piece of glacier ice,which is great for them;they&#39;re safe at this point.They&#39;re not going to die of hypothermia.They&#39;re going to get to land.But unfortunately,95 percent of the glaciers in the Arcticare also receding right nowto the point that the iceis ending up on landand not injecting any iceback into the ecosystem.

en:These ringed seals,these are the &quot;fatsicles&quot; of the Arctic.These little, fat dumplings,150-pound bundles of blubberare the mainstay of the polar bear.And they&#39;re not likethe harbor seals that you have here.These ringed seals alsolive out their entire life cycleassociated and connected to sea ice.They give birth inside the ice,and they feed on the Arctic codthat live under the ice.And here&#39;s a picture of sick ice.This is a piece of multi-year icethat&#39;s 12 years old.And what scientists didn&#39;t predictis that, as this ice melts,these big pocketsof black water are formingand they&#39;re grabbing the sun&#39;s energyand accelerating the melting process.

zh-cn:我们潜入了波弗特海这里的能见度为600英尺；我们都系上了安全绳索四处都是浮冰我很乐意花半个小时跟你们讲在这次潜水时，我们怎么差点把命给丢了重要的是，这张图片中的一块常年冰也就是角落的那一大块冰在这一块冰下生存这300多种微生物到了春天，当阳光照在上面浮游植物就在冰层下产生了接着产生更茂密的海草最后，一大批浮游生物所需的食物就有着落了那块冰的实际作用就像一座花园就像花园里的土壤。这是个倒立着的花园如果这块冰消失了，那么花园的土壤也就消失了
en:And here we are divingin the Beaufort Sea.The visibility&#39;s 600 ft.;we&#39;re on our safety lines;the ice is moving all over the place.I wish I could spend halfan hour telling youabout how we almost died on this dive.But what&#39;s important in this pictureis that you have a piece of multi-year ice,that big chunk of ice up in the corner.In that one single piece of ice,you have 300 species of microorganisms.And in the spring,when the sun returns to the ice,it forms the phytoplankton,grows under that ice,and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed,and then you get thezooplankton feeding on all that life.So really what the ice doesis it acts like a garden.It acts like the soil in a garden.It&#39;s an inverted garden.Losing that ice is likelosing the soil in a garden.

en:Here&#39;s me in my office.I hope you appreciate yours.This is after an hour under the ice.I can&#39;t feel my lips; my face is frozen;I can&#39;t feel my hands;I can&#39;t feel my feet.And I&#39;ve come up, and all I wantedto do was get out of the water.After an hour in these conditions,it&#39;s so extreme that, when I go down,almost every dive I vomit into my regulatorbecause my body can&#39;t dealwith the stress of the cold on my head.And so I&#39;m just so happythat the dive is over.I get to hand my camera to my assistant,and I&#39;m looking up at him,and I&#39;m going, &quot;Woo. Woo. Woo.&quot;Which means, &quot;Take my camera.&quot;And he thinks I&#39;m saying,&quot;Take my picture.&quot;So we had this littlecommunication breakdown.(Laughter)But it&#39;s worth it.

en:I&#39;m going to show you picturesof beluga whales, bowhead whales,and narwhals, and polar bears,and leopard seals today,but this picture right here means moreto me than any other I&#39;ve ever made.I dropped down in this ice hole,just through that hole that you just saw,and I looked up underthe underside of the ice,and I was dizzy;I thought I had vertigo.I got very nervous —no rope, no safety line,the whole world is moving around me —and I thought, &quot;I&#39;m in trouble.&quot;But what happenedis that the entire undersidewas full of these billionsof amphipods and copepodsmoving around and feedingon the underside of the ice,giving birth and living outtheir entire life cycle.This is the foundation of the whole food chainin the Arctic, right here.And when you have low productivity in this, in ice,the productivity in copepods go down.

en:This is a bowhead whale.Supposedly, science is statingthat it could be the oldest living animalon earth right now.This very whale right herecould be over 250 years old.This whale could have been bornaround the startof the Industrial Revolution.It could have survived150 years of whaling.And now its biggest threatis the disappearance of ice in the Northbecause of the livesthat we&#39;re leading in the South.

en:Narwhals, these majestic narwhalswith their eight-foot long ivory tusks,don&#39;t have to be here;they could be out on the open water.But they&#39;re forcing themselvesto come up in these tiny little ice holeswhere they can breathe, catch a breath,because right under that iceare all the swarms of cod.And the cod are therebecause they are feedingon all the copepods and amphipods.

en:Alright, my favorite part.When I&#39;m on my deathbed,I&#39;m going to rememberone story more than any other.Even though that spirit bearmoment was powerful,I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever haveanother experiencelike I did with these leopard seals.Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton,have had a bad reputation.They&#39;ve got that wryly smileon their mouth.They&#39;ve got those black sinister eyesand those spots on their body.They look positively prehistoricand a bit scary.And tragically in [2003],a scientist was taken downand drowned,and she was being consumedby a leopard seal.And people were like, &quot;We knewthey were vicious. We knew they were.&quot;And so people love to form their opinions.And that&#39;s when I got a story idea:I want to go to Antarctica,get in the water with as manyleopard seals as I possibly canand give them a fair shake —find out if they really are these viciousanimals, or if they&#39;re misunderstood.So this is that story.Oh, and they also happento eat Happy Feet.

en:As a species, as humans,we like to say penguins are really cute,therefore, leopard seals eat them,so leopard seals are ugly and bad.It doesn&#39;t work that way.The penguin doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s cute,and the leopard seal doesn&#39;tknow it&#39;s kind of big and monstrous.This is just the food chain unfolding.They&#39;re also big.They&#39;re not these little harbor seals.They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.And they&#39;re also curiously aggressive.You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac,floating in these icy waters,and a leopard seal comes upand bites the pontoon.The boat starts to sink, they race back to the shipand get to go home and tellthe stories of how they got attacked.All the leopard seal was doing —it&#39;s just biting a balloon.It just sees this big balloon in the ocean —it doesn&#39;t have hands —it&#39;s going to take a little bite,the boat pops, and off they go.

en:So after five days of crossingthe Drake Passage —isn&#39;t that beautiful —after five days of crossingthe Drake Passage,we have finally arrived at Antarctica.I&#39;m with my Swedish assistant and guide.His name is Goran Ehlmefrom Sweden — Goran.And he has a lot of experiencewith leopard seals. I have never seen one.So we come around the covein our little Zodiac boat,and there&#39;s this monstrous leopard seal.And even in his voice, he goes,&quot;That&#39;s a bloody big seal, ya.&quot;(Laughter)And this seal is takingthis penguin by the head,and it&#39;s flipping it back and forth.And what it&#39;s trying to dois turn that penguin inside-out,so it can eat the meat off the bones,and then it goes off and gets another one.

en:And so this leopard sealgrabbed another penguin,came under the boat, the Zodiac,starting hitting the hull of the boat.And we&#39;re trying to not fall in the water.And we sit down,and that&#39;s when Goran said to me,&quot;This is a good seal, ya.It&#39;s time for you to get in the water.&quot;(Laughter)And I looked at Goran,and I said to him, &quot;Forget that.&quot;But I think I probably used a different wordstarting with the letter &quot;F.&quot;But he was right.He scolded me out,and said, &quot;This is why we&#39;re here.And you purposed this stupid storyto National Geographic.And now you&#39;ve got to deliver.And you can&#39;t publish excuses.&quot;

en:So I had such dry mouth —probably not as bad as now —but I had such, such dry mouth.And my legs were just trembling.I couldn&#39;t feel my legs.I put my flippers on.I could barely part my lips.I put my snorkel in my mouth,and I rolled over the sideof the Zodiac into the water.And this was the first thing she did.She came racing up to me,engulfed my whole camera —and her teeth are up hereand down here —but Goran, before I had gotten in the water,had given me amazing advice.He said, &quot;If you get scared,you close your eyes, ya, and she&#39;ll go away.&quot;

en:So that&#39;s all I had to workwith at that point.But I just started to shoot these pictures.So she did this threat displayfor a few minutes,and then the most amazing thing happened —she totally relaxed.She went off, she got a penguin.She stopped about 10 feet away from me,and she sat there with this penguin,the penguin&#39;s flapping, and she let&#39;s it go.The penguin swims toward me, takes off.She grabs another one.She does this over and over.And it dawned on methat she&#39;s trying to feed me a penguin.Why else would she releasethese penguins at me?And after she did this four or five times,she swam by mewith this dejected look on her face.You don&#39;t want to be too anthropomorphic,but I swear that she looked at melike, &quot;This useless predator&#39;sgoing to starve in my ocean.&quot;

en:So realizing I couldn&#39;t catchswimming penguins,she&#39;d get these other penguinsand bring them slowly towards me,bobbing like this,and she&#39;d let them go.This didn&#39;t work.I was laughing so hard and so emotionalthat my mask was flooding,because I was crying underwater,just because it was so amazing.And so that didn&#39;t work.So then she&#39;d get another penguinand try this ballet-like sexy displaysliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter)And she would sort of bring themover to me and offer it to me.This went on for four days.This just didn&#39;t happen a couple of times.And then so she realizedI couldn&#39;t catch live ones,so she brought me dead penguins.(Laughter)Now I&#39;ve got four or five penguinsfloating around my head,and I&#39;m just sitting there shooting away.And she would often stopand have this dejected look on her facelike, &quot;Are you for real?&quot;Because she can&#39;t believeI can&#39;t eat this penguin.Because in her world,you&#39;re either breeding or you&#39;re eating —and I&#39;m not breeding, so ...

zh-cn:这还没完；它开始把企鹅翻过来放在我头上它想强行喂我吃。它逼着我退了几步它想强行喂我的镜头这是任何一个摄影师梦寐以求的它变得不耐烦了，对着我的脸吹泡泡我想，它想让我知道我这样下去会饿死的但是，它不达目的不罢休它还是不停地给我喂企鹅
en:And then that wasn&#39;t enough;she started to flip penguins onto my head.She was trying to force-feed me.She&#39;s pushing me around.She&#39;s trying to force-feed my camera,which is every photographer&#39;s dream.And she would get frustrated;she&#39;d blow bubbles in my face.She would, I think, let me knowthat I was going to starve.But yet she didn&#39;t stop.She would not stoptrying to feed me penguins.

zh-cn:在与这只雌性海豹相处的最后一天我以为我把它逼急了我非常紧张，它向我游了过来背朝下发出低沉的，手提钻般的喉音，嘎巴嘎巴嘎巴我以为它准备咬我一口以此警告我，我把它惹毛了而实际上，当时另一只海豹正躲在我身后蠢蠢欲动它这么做是为了把那只海豹吓跑它把那只大海豹赶走，抢了它的企鹅送到我面前
en:And on the last day with this femalewhere I thought I had pushed her too far,I got nervous because she came up to me,she rolled over on her back,and she did this deep, gutturaljackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok.And I thought, she&#39;s about to bite.She&#39;s about to let me knowshe&#39;s too frustrated with me.What had happenedwas another seal had snuck in behind me,and she did that to threat display.She chased that big seal away,went and got its penguinand brought it to me.

zh-cn:它并不是我水下遇到的唯一一只海豹我在水中还遇到了其它30多只海豹我从来没有受到任何威胁它们是我所拍摄的最不可思议的动物北极熊也是就像北极熊一样这些动物依赖着冰川才能生存对不起，我有些情不自禁
en:That wasn&#39;t the only sealI got in the water with.I got in the waterwith 30 other leopard seals,and I never once had a scary encounter.They are the most remarkable animalsI&#39;ve ever worked with,and the same with polar bears.And just like the polar bears,these animals dependon an icy environment.I get emotional. Sorry.
