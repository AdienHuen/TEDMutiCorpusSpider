zh-cn:还记不记得高中或是初中时奧德修斯和塞壬的故事？有这么个英雄，奧德修斯从特洛伊战争返回他站在战船的甲板上和大副说着话他说：“明天我们驶过那些岩石岩石上会坐者一群美女她们是塞壬她们会唱首摄人心魄的歌会令听到歌声的水手着迷船撞上岩石而亡你会想 既然如此他们应该另找一条航线避开塞壬但是奧德修斯说”我想听到那首歌我会用蜡把你和其他所有人的耳朵都封上－这样你们就听不见这歌了你们把我绑在桅杆上这样我就能听到歌并且航行不受影响这个船长置全船人的危险于不顾就为了自己听首歌
en:Do you remember the storyof Odysseus and the Sirensfrom high school or junior high school?There was this hero, Odysseus, who&#39;s heading back homeafter the Trojan War.And he&#39;s standing on the deck of his ship,he&#39;s talking to his first mate,and he&#39;s saying,&quot;Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks,and on those rocks sit some beautiful womencalled Sirens.And these women sing an enchanting song,a song so alluringthat all sailors who hear itcrash into the rocks and die.&quot;Now you would expect, given that,that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens,but instead Odysseus says,&quot;I want to hear that song.And so what I&#39;m going to dois I&#39;m going to pour wax in the earsof you and all the men —stay with me —so that you can&#39;t hear the song,and then I&#39;m going to have you tie me to the mastso that I can listenand we can all sail by unaffected.&quot;So this is a captainputting the life of every single person on the ship at riskso that he can hear a song.

zh-cn:我想要是这种状况他们应该事先练习几次奧德修斯会说：“好，我们试试。你把我绑在桅杆上，我怎么央求不管说什么你都不要解开绳子好，现在把我绑上桅杆吧。”大副取了绳子把奧德修斯牢牢绑在桅杆上奧德修斯拼命假装求情说：“放开我吧。放开我吧。我想听那首歌。放开我吧。”大副会很明智地拒绝不会解开奧德修斯然后奧德修斯说；“好，你能胜任这个任务。好，解开我咱们吃晚饭去。”大副迟疑了“我们还在练习呢还是我就解开绳子呢？”大副想“好吧，排练总有结束的时候”他解开奧德修斯，但是奧德修斯大发雷霆“你个蠢货，你个白痴。明天你要这么干，我们都死定了每个人都死定了不管我说什么都不能解开！”他把大副摔倒在地他们就这么折腾了一夜－排练，绑在桅杆上哄大副解开绳子毫不留情地殴打大副闹剧就来了
en:And I&#39;d like to think if this was the case,they probably would have rehearsed it a few times.Odysseus would have said, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s do a dry run.You tie me to the mast, and I&#39;m going to beg and plead.And no matter what I say, you cannot untie me from the mast.All right, so tie me to the mast.&quot;And the first mate takes a ropeand ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot.And Odysseus does his best job playactingand says, &quot;Untie me. Untie me.I want to hear that song. Untie me.&quot;And the first mate wisely resistsand doesn&#39;t untie Odysseus.And then Odysseus says, &quot;I see that you can get it.All right, untie me now and we&#39;ll get some dinner.&quot;And the first mate hesitates.He&#39;s like, &quot;Is this still the rehearsal,or should I untie him?&quot;And the first mate thinks,&quot;Well, I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end.&quot;So he unties Odysseus, and Odysseus flips out.He&#39;s like, &quot;You idiot. You moron.If you do that tomorrow, I&#39;ll be dead, you&#39;ll be dead,every single one of the men will be dead.Now just don&#39;t untie me no matter what.&quot;He throws the first mate to the ground.This repeats itself through the night —rehearsal, tying to the mast,conning his way out of it,beating the poor first mate up mercilessly.Hilarity ensues.

zh-cn:把自己绑到桅杆上大概是最早的心理学家称为承诺手段的书面记录了承诺手段是你在冷静状态下做出的决定来约束自己以防在冲动之下做出事后后悔的事情你想想，人内心有两种状态当涉及到诱惑的问题时学者们早就用了两个自我的比喻第一是当下的自我就象是奥德修斯 他一听到这歌就想去前排占个好位子只想着此时此刻和当下的满足但是另一个自我，未来的自我作为一个老人的奥德修斯他只想在远离伊萨卡的别墅里和妻子佩罗普过退休生活这是另一个自我
en:Tying yourself to a mastis perhaps the oldest written exampleof what psychologists call a commitment device.A commitment device is a decision that you makewith a cool head to bind yourselfso that you don&#39;t do something regrettablewhen you have a hot head.Because there&#39;s two heads inside one personwhen you think about it.Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selveswhen it comes to questions of temptation.There is first, the present self.This is like Odysseus when he&#39;s hearing the song.He just wants to get to the front row.He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.But then there&#39;s this other self, the future self.This is Odysseus as an old manwho wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villawith his wife Penelopeoutside of Ithaca — the other one.

zh-cn:那么为什么我们需要承诺手段呢？因为诱惑难以抗拒19世纪的英国经济学家老纳索威廉姆说“放弃我们能得到的享受或者追寻遥远而不是眼下的结果是人类意志中最痛苦的事情之一。”如果你为自己设定目标，并且你跟普通人一样也许你会意识到不是定的目标高不可攀而是缺乏自律去坚持下来减肥是现实可行的增加运动是现实可行的但是抵抗诱惑很难
en:So why do we need commitment devices?Well resisting temptation is hard,as the 19th century English economistNassau William Senior said,&quot;To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power,or to seek distant rather than immediate results,are among the most painful exertionsof the human will.&quot;If you set goals for yourself and you&#39;re like a lot of other people,you probably realizeit&#39;s not that your goals are physically impossiblethat&#39;s keeping you from achieving them,it&#39;s that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them.It&#39;s physically possible to lose weight.It&#39;s physically possible to exercise more.But resisting temptationis hard.
时间： 4:09
zh-cn:另一个难以抵抗诱惑的原因是当下的自我和未来的自我之间不平等的战争当下的自我活在现在控制一些这个自我有强大英勇的胳膊抓起甜甜圈送到嘴里去而未来的自我都不在场它还在远远的未来，没什么力量它连律师都不在场没人会为了未来自我而争辩所以当下的自我可以击败未来的所有梦想所以在这两个斗争的自我之间要有承诺手段来平衡二者的力量
en:The other reasonthat it&#39;s difficult to resist temptationis because it&#39;s an unequal battlebetween the present self and the future self.I mean, let&#39;s face it, the present self is present.It&#39;s in control. It&#39;s in power right now.It has these strong, heroic armsthat can lift doughnuts into your mouth.And the future self is not even around.It&#39;s off in the future. It&#39;s weak.It doesn&#39;t even have a lawyer present.There&#39;s nobody to stick up for the future self.And so the present self can trounceall over its dreams.So there&#39;s this battle between the two selves that&#39;s being fought,and we need commitment devicesto level the playing field between the two.

zh-cn:我很拥护承诺设备把自己绑到桅杆上是最古老的一个例子，还有其他的把信用卡锁起来不把垃圾食品带回家而减少摄入断网来保证使用电脑在我自己知道承诺手段之前我就在创造他们了当我还是哥伦比亚大学的苦逼博士后时我还在“发表（论文）或淘汰”中挣扎我得为了文章一天写五页不然就得丢掉5块钱
en:Now I&#39;m a big fan of commitment devices actually.Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one, but there are other onessuch as locking a credit card away with a keyor not bringing junk food into the house so you won&#39;t eat itor unplugging your Internet connectionso you can use your computer.I was creating commitment devices of my ownlong before I knew what they were.So when I was a starving post-docat Columbia University,I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career.I had to write five pages a daytowards papersor I would have to give up five dollars.

zh-cn:当你得执行这些承诺手段的时候你就意识到了执行的细节太邪恶了因为要丢掉五块钱不那么容易你不能烧了，那是犯法我想 我可以捐给慈善机构或者给我老婆，等等但是转念一想，我这是在混淆视线因为不写作是坏事，但慈善是好事这样赠予就把不写作变得合理了然后我想了想我可以把它给新纳粹分子但是，这比不写作更坏所以这个方法行不通最后我决定我把它放进信封留到地铁上有时候是好人捡到有时候是坏人捡到总的来说 只是没有意义的但是我会后悔的丢钱行为（笑声）这就是承诺手段
en:And when you try to execute these commitment devices,you realize the devil is really in the details.Because it&#39;s not that easy to get rid of five dollars.I mean, you can&#39;t burn it; that&#39;s illegal.And I thought, well I could give it to a charityor give it to my wife or something like that.But then I thought, oh, I&#39;m sending myself mixed messages.Because not writing is bad, but giving to charity is good.So then I would kind of justify not writingby giving a gift.And then I kind of flipped that around and thought,well I could give it to the neo-Nazis.But then I was like, that&#39;s more bad than writing is good,and so that wouldn&#39;t work.So ultimately, I just decidedI would leave it in an envelope on the subway.Sometimes a good person would find it,sometimes a bad person would find it.On average, it was just a completely pointless exchange of moneythat I would regret.(Laughter)Such it is with commitment devices.

zh-cn:虽然我很喜欢它但是对于承诺手段我仍有两个顾虑在使用的时候可能会感受到首先就是当你使用这些手段的时候比如说不写就付钱这只是会不断地提醒自己没有自控能力你只是在告诉自己，“没有承诺手段，你会一事无成，你不能自律。”这样在一个没有承诺手段的情况下－比如“天哪，那家伙要给我一个甜甜圈我可没有防御机制”你就给吃了所以我不喜欢承诺手段让我们失去能力我想自律就象是肌肉锻炼越多就越强壮
en:But despite my like for them,there&#39;s two nagging concernsthat I&#39;ve always had about commitment devices,and you might feel this if you use them yourself.So the first is,when you&#39;ve got one of these devices going,such as this contract to write everyday or pay,it&#39;s just a constant reminderthat you have no self-control.You&#39;re just telling yourself, &quot;Without you, commitment device,I am nothing, I have no self-discipline.&quot;And then when you&#39;re ever in a situationwhere you don&#39;t have a commitment device in place —like, &quot;Oh my God, that person&#39;s offering me a doughnut,and I have no defense mechanism,&quot; —you just eat it.So I don&#39;t like the way that they take the power away from you.I think self-discipline is something, it&#39;s like a muscle.The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.

zh-cn:承诺手段的另一个问题就是你可以很容易耍滑头就逃过你说：“哎呀，今天写不了啦我有个TED演讲，还得接受5个媒体访问然后得去个鸡尾酒晚会 然后我肯定就喝醉了所以我今天肯定写不了。”这样一来，你就象奥德修斯和大副二者合一你把自己绑起来然后耍个手段逃脱了然后事后就痛打自己
en:The other problem with commitment devicesis that you can always weasel your way out of them.You say, &quot;Well, of course I can&#39;t write today,because I&#39;m giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews,and then I&#39;m going to a cocktail party and then I&#39;ll be drunk after that.And so there&#39;s no way that this is going to work.&quot;So in effect, you are like Odysseus and the first matein one person.You&#39;re putting yourself, you&#39;re binding yourself,and you&#39;re weaseling your way out of it,and then you&#39;re beating yourself up afterwards.

zh-cn:为了寻找承诺手段之外的方法来改善人们与未来自我的关系我努力了近十年特别地，我对财政意义上的未来自我关系感兴趣这是时间跨度的话题我要说的是就是储蓄储蓄是个典型的两个自我的问题当下的自我完全不想储蓄它要消费但是未来的自我要现在的自我储蓄所以这是个时间跨度的问题看看储蓄率自50年代以来一直下跌同时，退休风险指数－在退休时无法有足够的积累一直在上升我们现在的状况是按照麦肯锡全球研究中心预计婴儿潮的人群里每三个就有两个无法完成退休前为退休生活的积累
en:So I&#39;ve been workingfor about a decade nowon finding other waysto change people&#39;s relationship to the future selfwithout using commitment devices.In particular, I&#39;m interested in the relationshipto the future financial self.And this is a timely issue.I&#39;m talking about the topic of saving.Now saving is a classic two selves problem.The present self does not want to save at all.It wants to consume.Whereas the future self wants the present self to save.So this is a timely problem.We look at the savings rateand it has been declining since the 1950s.At the same time, the Retirement Risk Index,the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement,has been increasing.And we&#39;re at a situation nowwhere for every three baby boomers,the McKinsey Global Institute predictsthat two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needswhile they&#39;re in retirement.

zh-cn:我们能做些什么呢？有个哲学家 德瑞克巴菲特他说了一些话对我和我的合作者很有启发他说：“我们忽视未来自我是因为没有信念或缺乏想像。”也就是说我们不知怎么的不相信自己会变老或者我们没法想像有天我们会变老一方面这听起来很可笑当然我们知道自己会变老但是有没有可能有些东西我们相信的同时又不相信呢？
en:So what can we do about this?There&#39;s a philosopher, Derek Parfit,who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I.He said that, &quot;We might neglect our future selvesbecause of some failure of belief or imagination.&quot;That is to say,we somehow might not believe that we&#39;re going to get old,or we might not be able to imaginethat we&#39;re going to get old some day.On the one hand, it sounds ridiculous.Of course, we know that we&#39;re going to get old.But aren&#39;t there things that we believe and don&#39;t believe at the same time?

zh-cn:我和我的合作者用电脑这个时代最伟大的工具来帮助人们想像想像未来可能的样子在这儿我会展示几个第一个是“分配生成器”可以向人们展示未来可能的状况它能显示你未来可能取得的一百种同等概率的结果每一种结果都用这些记号来表示各排上的每一个单位代表一定程度的财富和退休期位置越高也就意味着你可以享受富足的晚年越往下也就是你得努力糊口如果你进行投资如果说你承认这一百件事有可能发生在自己身上并最终决定我的财富
en:So my coauthors and I have used computers,the greatest tool of our time,to assist people&#39;s imaginationand help them imagine what it might be liketo go into the future.And I&#39;ll show you some of these tools right here.The first is called the distribution builder.It shows people what the future might be likeby showing them a hundred equally probable outcomesthat might be obtained in the future.Each outcome is shown by one of these markers,and each sits on a rowthat represents a level of wealth and retirement.Being up at the topmeans that you&#39;re enjoying a high income in retirement.Being down at the bottommeans that you&#39;re struggling to make ends meet.When you make an investment,what you&#39;re really saying is, &quot;I acceptthat any one of these 100 thingscould happen to me and determine my wealth.&quot;
时间： 9:52
zh-cn:你就可以把收入进行分配了你可以象这个人一样修改你的命运但是是有代价的也就是说你得在现在储蓄更多一旦发现了一个感兴趣的投资你就点击“完成”然后这些记号慢慢得一个接一个消失这就象是投资了什么然后坐收红利一样最后将只有一个标记剩下来这就决定了退休时的财富
en:Now you can try to move your outcomes around.You can try to manipulate your fate, like this person is doing,but it costs you something to do it.It means that you have to save more today.Once you find an investment that you&#39;re happy with,what people do is they click &quot;done&quot;and the markers begin to disappear,slowly, one by one.It simulates what it is like to invest in somethingand to watch that investment pan out.At the end, there will only be one marker left standingand it will determine our wealth in retirement.

zh-cn:这个人在退休时能有工作收入的百分之一百五十的入帐他们退休了比工作的时候挣的钱还要多大多数人看到这都会有点喜不自禁一想到自己退休了能比工作的时候还多挣百分之五十但是 如果最后的结果是在底部这应该会让你有点担心或者不寒而栗一想到退休了还得挣扎过活的话通过不停地使用这个工具来预测未来的结果人们能够意识到今天进行的储蓄决定了明天的生活质量
en:Yes, this person retiredat 150 percent of their working income in retirement.They&#39;re making more money while retiredthan they were making while they were working.If you&#39;re like most people,just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy —just to think about making50 percent more money in retirement than before.However, had you ended up on the very bottom,it might have given you a slight senseof dread and/or nauseathinking about struggling to get by in retirement.By using this tool over and overand simulating outcome after outcome,people can understandthat the investments and savings that they undertake todaydetermine their well-being in the future.
时间：11:06
zh-cn:人们常受情绪而激发但是激发每个人的事物却往往不一样这个工具使用了图片很多人不大受代表钱的数字而影响但是钱能买到的东西可以这个分配生成器显示的不是数字而是具体你能买到的东西比如 你的每个月的退休金能有三千，两千五，两千的话这是你买得起的公寓随着排名的下降能看出来质量越来越差有一些看上去象我作为研究生的时候住过的地方而最底下如果你退休的时候一无所有那就得面对老无所居的残酷现实这些照片拍的都是对应价格的网上实际在售的公寓
en:Now people are motivated through emotions,but different people find different things motivating.This is a simulationthat uses graphics,but other people find motivating what money can buy,not just numbers.So here I made a distribution builderwhere instead of showing numerical outcomes,I show people what those outcomes will get you,in particular apartments that you can affordif you&#39;re retiring on 3,000, 2,500,2,000 dollars per month and so on.As you move down the ladder of apartments,you see that they get worse and worse.Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student.And as you get to the very bottom,you&#39;re faced with the unfortunate realitythat if you don&#39;t save anything for retirement,you won&#39;t be able to afford any housing at all.Those are actual pictures of actual apartmentsrenting for that amountas advertised on the Internet.

zh-cn:最后一个我想展示的行为时光机器是我和哈尔赫施费尔德共同开发的他是从一个之前项目加入我称为合作者的也就是“Bill Sharpe”这个工具提供具象的现实我们拍下用户的照片－这个是大学生－然后我们用软件模拟衰老看看当他们六七八十岁的时候是什么样子我们试着测试如果帮助你想像将来的自己的样子能不能改变投资行为
en:The last thing I&#39;ll show you,the last behavioral time machine,is something that I created with Hal Hershfield,who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project,Bill Sharpe.And what it isis an exploration into virtual reality.So what we do is we take pictures of people —in this case, college-age people —and we use software to age themand show these people what they&#39;ll look likewhen they&#39;re 60, 70, 80 years old.And we try to testwhether actually assisting your imaginationby looking at the face of your future selfcan change you investment behavior.

zh-cn:这是我们的一个试验左边是我们测试对象的年轻的脸他可以调控自己的储蓄率当他的储蓄率降低指针在最左边意味着储蓄为零他目前的年收入－现在他每天能拿到手的钱很多百分之九十一但是退休金会很低他的退休金只有工作时薪水的百分之四十四如果现在提高到法定的储蓄上限他的退休金就上升但是他现在就无钱可花而会过得不快乐还有其他的状况来展现未来的情形从未来的角度来看，一切都是相反的如果储蓄很少未来靠收入的百分之四十生活就会很不爽快如果现在多储蓄一点未来就会好过很多因为退休金几乎和工作的收入一样多
en:So this is one of our experiments.Here we see the face of the young subject on the left.He&#39;s given a controlthat allows him to adjust his savings rate.As he moves his savings rate down,it means that he&#39;s saving zerowhen it&#39;s all the way here at the left.You can see his current annual income —this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today —is quite high, 91 percent,but his retirement income is quite low.He&#39;s going to retire on 44 percentof what he earned while he was working.If he saves the maximum legal amount,his retirement income goes up,but he&#39;s unhappybecause now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today.Other conditions show people the future self.And from the future self&#39;s point of view, everything is in reverse.If you save very little,the future self is unhappyliving on 44 percent of the income.Whereas if the present self saves a lot,the future self is delighted,where the income is close up near 100 percent.

zh-cn:为了推广这个概念我和哈尔以及安莲兹开发出了行为学时间机器这个软件不仅让你看到未来也可以看到你未来会根据退休收入的不同而有各种层次的情绪反应比如说有人用这个工具移动光标查看面部表情年轻的脸越来越开心，但没有零星储蓄而老年的年就愁容满面如果转换到中等的储蓄率然后是高储蓄率年轻时候的脸笑容越来越淡年老的脸则随之变的开心我们以此来看看人们是否会对此反应它的好处是它并不会左右人们的想法因为一侧的脸在笑而另一侧脸就在愁它并不指手画脚说选择哪一边只是提醒你对自己的未来负责的人就是自己
en:To bring this to a wider audience,I&#39;ve been working with Hal and Allianzto create something we call the behavioral time machine,in which you not only get to see yourself in the future,but you get to see anticipated emotional reactionsto different levels of retirement wealth.So for instance,here is somebody using the tool.And just watch the facial expressionsas they move the slider.The younger face gets happier and happier, saving nothing.The older face is miserable.And slowly, slowly we&#39;re bringing it up to a moderate savings rate.And then it&#39;s a high savings rate.The younger face is getting unhappy.The older face is quite pleasedwith the decision.We&#39;re going to see if this has an effect on what people do.And what&#39;s nice about itis it&#39;s not something that biasing people actually,because as one face smiles,the other face frowns.It&#39;s not telling you which way to put the slider,it&#39;s just reminding you that you areconnected to and legally tied tothis future self.

en:Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being.And that&#39;s something that&#39;s easy to forget.This use of virtual realityis not just good for making people look older.There are programs you can getto see how people might lookif they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun,if they gain weight and so on.And what&#39;s good is,unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith,you don&#39;t have to program these by yourselfin order to see the virtual reality.There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollarsthat do the same thing.This is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor.You might recognize him from the previous demos.And just for kicks we ran his picturethrough the balding, aging and weight gain softwareto see how he would look.Hal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourselfto disabuse you of that last image.And I&#39;ll close it there.
