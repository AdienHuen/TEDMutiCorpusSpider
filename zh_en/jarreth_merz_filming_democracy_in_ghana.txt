zh-cn:我出生在瑞士在西非的加纳长大加纳对儿时的我是安全的家我很自由快乐70年代早期是加纳的音乐和艺术的辉煌时期但是70年代末加纳陷入政治动荡和政策混乱
en:I was born in Switzerlandand raised in Ghana, West Africa.Ghana felt safe to me as a child.I was free, I was happy.The early 70smarked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.But then by the end of the decade,the country had fallen back into political instabilityand mismanagement.

zh-cn:1979年我目睹了军事政变我们一群孩子聚集在一个朋友家里是个破烂昏暗的棚子有台破旧的黑白电视机在背景处一直闪动着放的是前总统和将军被蒙住眼睛绑在柱子上行刑的队伍来了，枪决了他们将军死了这个场景在电视上直播不久后，我们离开了加纳回到了瑞士
en:In 1979,I witnessed my first military coup.We the children had gathered at a friend&#39;s house.It was a dimly lit shack.There was a beaten up black and white televisionflickering in the background,and a former head of state and generalwas being blindfoldedand tied to the pole.The firing squad aimed, fired —the general was dead.Now this was being broadcast live.And shortly after, we left the country,and we returned to Switzerland.

zh-cn:然后欧洲对我来说是个冲击我开始觉得有必要掩盖自己的肤色以融入这个社会我想如变色龙一样我觉得这是生存的技巧这个方法成功了，至少我觉得是这样的
en:Now Europe came as a shock to me,and I think I started feeling the needto shed my skin in order to fit in.I wanted to blend in like a chameleon.I think it was a tactic of survival.And it worked, or so I believed.

zh-cn:2008年的时候我开始思考我的人生定位我觉得我被定型为一个演员总是演异国风情的非洲人或是暴力的非洲人非洲恐怖分子我琢磨在做回我自己之前我得演多少恐怖分子？我开始以我的一部分以我的非洲血统为耻幸运的是2008年的时候在阔别了28年之后我决定回到加纳我打算拍一部2008年总统大选的纪录片在那儿，我以搜寻我儿时的印迹作为开始但是我都没有意识到我突然身处政治示威的队伍里周围围绕着成千上万高声呼喊人
en:So here I was in 2008wondering where I was in my life.And I felt I was being typecast as an actor.I was always playing the exotic African.I was playing the violent African,the African terrorist.And I was thinking,how many terrorists could I possibly playbefore turning into one myself?And I had become ashamed of the other,the African in me.And fortunately I decided in 2008to return to Ghana,after 28 years of absence.I wanted to document on filmthe 2008 presidential elections.And there, I started by searchingfor the footprints in my childhood.And before I even knew it,I was suddenly on a stagesurrounded by thousands of cheering peopleduring a political rally.

zh-cn:我意识到，当年离开这个国家的时候在民主环境下的自由公平选举只不过是个梦想如今我回来的时候，梦想已经实现了尽管它很脆弱我想，是不是像我在寻找自身定位一样加纳也在探索它的定位？发生在加纳的一切就像发生在我身上一切的隐喻？就好像在西方式的标准下我并没有完全挖掘我的潜能加纳也是虽然我们都很努力的尝试过
en:And I realized that, when I&#39;d left the country,free and fair elections in a democratic environmentwere a dream.And now that I&#39;d returned, that dream had become reality,though a fragile reality.And I was thinking,was Ghana searching for its identitylike I was looking for my identity?Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphorfor what was happening in me?And it was as if through the standards of my Western life,I hadn&#39;t lived up to my full potential.I mean, nor had Ghana,even though we had been trying very hard.

zh-cn:1957年加纳是撒哈拉以南非洲国家中第一个取得独立的国家50年代末期加纳和新加坡的GDP一样现在新加坡是个发达国家而加纳不是但这也许正是证明我们自己的时候是的，认识历史非常重要要从另一个角度去解读它非常重要但是也许我们应该重视自身文化中的力量并以现在的文化作为基石
en:Now in 1957,Ghana was the first sub-Saharan countryto gain its independence.In the late 50s,Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP.I mean, today, Singapore is a First World countryand Ghana is not.But maybe it was time to prove to myself,yes, it&#39;s important to understand the past,it is important to look at it in a different light,but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own cultureand build on those foundations in the present.

zh-cn:2008年12月7日，我在现场早晨7点投票站向选民开放但选民想要掌握他们政治命运的愿望是如此急切他们凌晨4点就开始排队有些住在附近，有些远道而来但他们都想表达自己的声音我问一个选民：“你打算投谁的票？”他说：“不好意思不能告诉你。”他说他心中有打算我非常理解，这是他们的选举他们不会让任何人夺走这个权利
en:So here I was, December 7th, 2008.The polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 AM,but voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands,were starting to line up at 4:00 AM in the morning.And they had traveled from near, they had traveled from far,because they wanted to make their voices heard.And I asked one of the voters, I said, &quot;Whom are you going to vote for?&quot;And he said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t tell you.&quot;He said that his vote was in his heart.And I understood, this was their election,and they weren&#39;t going to let anyonetake it away from them.

zh-cn:第一轮选举没有诞生一个明晰的获选人－还没有人完全占上风－所以3周后进行第二轮选举候选人重新开始竞选活动他们收起了文绉绉的措辞气氛变得激烈然后就出现了意料之中的状况投票站收到举报声称投票箱被窃取随之而来一系列的麻烦人群开始失去控制我们目睹了大街上大量的暴力事件很多人惨遭毒打军队开始开火 人群混乱不堪完全一片混乱我的心渐渐往下沉因为我想，再一次非洲再一次证明我们非洲人没有能力自治不仅如此，我正在记录着－记录着我自己的文化的短处
en:Now the first round of the voting didn&#39;t bring forth a clear winner —so nobody had achieved the absolute majority —so voting went into a second round three weeks later.The candidates were back on the road; they were campaigning.The rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.The heat was on.And then the cliche came to haunt us.There were claims of intimidationat the polling stations,of ballot boxes being stolen.Inflated results started coming inand the mob was starting to get out of control.We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.People were being beaten brutally.The army started firing their guns. People were scrambling.It was complete chaos.And my heart sank,because I thought, here we are again.Here is another proofthat the African is not capable of governing himself.And not only that, I am documenting it —documenting my own cultural shortcomings.

zh-cn:然而当枪声逐渐散去人群开始呼喊我无法相信我所听到的他们在呼喊“我们渴望和平”“我们渴望和平”我意识到和平必然来自人民毕竟是他们的抉择而他们这样做了于是之前嘈杂混乱的声音变成和谐的乐章人民和谐地表达想法这是可能的民主可以以和平手段来实现它可以通过人民的意愿实现他们正为之急切地努力着并全心全意地努力着来实现和平的
en:So when the echo of the gunshotshad lingered,it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob,and I didn&#39;t believe what I was hearing.They were chanting, &quot;We want peace.We want peace.&quot;And I realized it had to come from the people.After all, they decide,and they did.So the sounds that were before distorted and loud,were suddenly a melody.The sounds of the voices were harmonious.So it could happen.A democracy could be upheld peacefully.It could be, by the will of the masseswho were now urgently pressingwith all their heart and all their willfor peace.

zh-cn:现在有个有趣的对比在西方我们宣扬民主的力量我们是其完美模范但实际上当加纳处在和2000年美国大选的相同处境时－布什对戈尔那样的处境时候选人没有表现出任何不情愿去让体制和人民做抉择加纳尊重了民主和它的人民它没有把选举带到最高法庭上而是让人民决定
en:Now here&#39;s an interesting comparison.We in the West,we preach the values,the golden light of democracy,that we are the shining example of how it&#39;s done.But when it comes down to it,Ghana found itself in the same placein which the U.S. election stalledin the 2000 presidential elections —Bush versus Gore.But instead of the unwillingness of the candidatesto allow the system to proceed and the people to decide,Ghana honored democracyand its people.It didn&#39;t leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide;the people did.

zh-cn:然而第二轮选举也没有诞生获选者我说，票数非常接近选举委员会在各党派的同意下决定进行前所未有的第二轮复选人们回到选举站去决定谁做他们的总统而不是让司法系统来做结果如何？成功了失败的候选人放弃职权加纳踏入新的民主进程在民主需要的时候他们没有滥用职权人们深深坚信真正的民主这证明了非洲人民有能力自治
en:Now the second round of votingdid not bring forth a clear winner either.I mean, it was so incredibly close.The electoral commissioner declared,with the consent of the parties,to run an unprecedentedsecond re-run.So the people went back to the pollsto determine their own president,not the legal system.And guess what, it worked.The defeated candidategave up powerand made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.I mean, at the absolute timefor the absolute need of democracy,they did not abuse their power.The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep,proving that the African is capable of governing himself.

zh-cn:现在加纳和非洲艰难的(民主)斗争还没有结束但我有证据，民主的另一面是存在的我们不应该视而不见现在我意识到我的定位不仅是在西方或是非洲我仍在寻找我的定位但我目睹加纳开创了更好的民主加纳告诉了我用不一样的视角看人看自己是的我们非洲人能行
en:Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africais not over,but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists,and that we must not take it for granted.Now I have learnedthat my place is not just in the West or in Africa,and I&#39;m still searchingfor my identity,but I saw Ghanacreate democracy better.Ghana taught meto look at people differentlyand to look at myself differently.And yes,we Africans can.
