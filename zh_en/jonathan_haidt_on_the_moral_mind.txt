zh-cn:想象两个美国人到意大利旅游一起去看米开朗基罗的名作“大卫”当他们和巨大石雕面对面时两个人都望着出神第一个人﹐我们就叫他亚当吧被完美的人体肌理震慑住了第二个人 我们就叫他比尔吧也吓傻了 - 被那两腿间的玩意儿让我试问这两个男人谁比较有可能把票投给小布什谁投给了高尔﹖
en:Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy.They go to see Michelangelo&#39;s &quot;David,&quot;and when they finally come face to face with the statue,they both freeze dead in their tracks.The first guy — we&#39;ll call him Adam —is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form.The second guy — we&#39;ll call him Bill —is transfixed by embarrassment, at staring at the thing there in the center.So here&#39;s my question for you:which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush,which for Al Gore?

zh-cn:大家不用举手因为我们都有一样的刻板印象我们都知道是比尔在这个例子里﹐刻板印象反映了事实事实上﹐自由党员的确比保守党员更容易接受新体验那些喜欢接受新体验的人渴望新鲜 多样性 新想法 旅行较难接受新体验的人喜欢熟悉 安全 可靠的事物
en:I don&#39;t need a show of handsbecause we all have the same political stereotypes.We all know that it&#39;s Bill.And in this case, the stereotype corresponds to reality.It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservativeson a major personality trait called openness to experience.People who are high in openness to experiencejust crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel.People low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable.

zh-cn:如果你知道这些特性你便能了解人类许多难解的行为了解为什么艺术家和会计师如此不同你可以预测他们喜欢看的书他们喜欢去的旅游点甚至他们的饮食偏好只要你了解这个特性﹐你便能理解为什么这么多人喜欢去连锁餐厅吃饭 但你却一个都不认识(笑声)这个特性也让我们理解政治研究这个性格特质的研究者 Robert McCrae 说“开放的人偏向自由 进步 左翼政治思想”他们喜欢一个开放 持续改变的社会“封闭的人偏好保守 传统 右翼的观点。”
en:If you know about this trait,you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior.You can understand why artists are so different from accountants.You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read,what kinds of places they like to travel to,and what kinds of food they like to eat.Once you understand this trait, you can understandwhy anybody would eat at Applebee&#39;s, but not anybody that you know.(Laughter)This trait also tells us a lot about politics.The main researcher of this trait, Robert McCrae says that,&quot;Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views&quot; —they like a society which is open and changing —&quot;whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional, right-wing views.&quot;

OK.Please raise your hand if you&#39;d say you&#39;re libertarian.OK, about a — two dozen.And please raise your hand if you&#39;d say you are right of center or conservative.One, two, three, four, five — about eight or 10.

zh-cn:好。这就是问题。如果我们的目标是了解世界深刻的进一步了解世界但缺乏道德多样性让了解世界变得更难因为当每个人都分享一样的价值观和道德观便成为一个团队﹐一旦进入团队心理原本开放的思想就会闭塞当自由队在2004年败选就像在2000年一样﹐我们自我安慰(笑声)我们尝试自我解释为什么有一半美国人投给另外一队我们想 他们一定是被宗教蒙蔽 或是纯粹愚蠢(笑声)(掌声)如果你认为投给共和党的另一半美国人是因为他们被蒙蔽了我想告诉你的是你被道德母体限制住了某一种特别的道德母体所谓的道德母体﹐就像“黑客任务”里面的大计算机一样
en:OK. This is a bit of a problem.Because if our goal is to understand the world,to seek a deeper understanding of the world,our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.Because when people all share values, when people all share morals,they become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams,it shuts down open-minded thinking.When the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004,and as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves.(Laughter)We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team.We think they must be blinded by religion, or by simple stupidity.(Laughter)(Applause)So, if you think that half of America votes Republicanbecause they are blinded in this way,then my message to you is that you&#39;re trapped in a moral matrix,in a particular moral matrix.And by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie &quot;The Matrix.&quot;

zh-cn:让我们从头开始道德是什么﹖它从哪里来﹖心理学中最糟的想法便是我们像一张白纸一样出生发展心理学告诉我们婴儿来到世界上时已经知道许多有关世界和社会让他们变得更易学习却很难向他人学习有关这些与生俱来的天赋有个人说的很好脑科学家 Gary Marcus他说“脑的初始组织不是来自经验自然提供了第一个版本﹐经验只能修改先建不代表不可塑﹔而是组织先于经验。”那么道德的第一个版本是什么﹖我和同事 Craig Joseph阅读了许多人类学的文献有关不同文化的道德同时也在进化心理学里找相同处跨领域的人谈论的时候他们都谈论什么跨文化和跨物种的人又谈论什么﹖我们总共找到五种我们称它们为五种道德基础
en:Let&#39;s start at the beginning.What is morality and where does it come from?The worst idea in all of psychologyis the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth.Developmental psychology has shownthat kids come into the world already knowing so muchabout the physical and social worlds,and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain thingsand hard to learn others.The best definition of innateness I&#39;ve ever seen —this just clarifies so many things for me —is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus.He says, &quot;The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience.Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises.Built-in doesn&#39;t mean unmalleable;it means organized in advance of experience.&quot;OK, so what&#39;s on the first draft of the moral mind?To find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and Iread through the literature on anthropology,on culture variation in moralityand also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches.What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines?That you find across cultures and even across species?We found five — five best matches,which we call the five foundations of morality.

zh-cn:第一种是伤害-照护我们都是哺乳类﹐我们都有许多神经和荷尔蒙程序让我们与他人联结﹐关怀他人同情他人﹐尤其那些脆弱容易受伤的人让我们对那些造成伤害的人有强烈感觉这个道德基础含括了我在TED所听到的七成的道德陈述
en:The first one is harm/care.We&#39;re all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programmingthat makes us really bond with others, care for others,feel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable.It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm.This moral foundation underlies about 70 percentof the moral statements I&#39;ve heard here at TED.

zh-cn:第二个道德基础是公平-相等有一些模糊的证据证明你是否能在其它动物身上找到相互性但在人类身上的例子却再清楚不过了这幅 Norman Rockwell 的画叫做“金科玉律”Karen Armstrong 也告诉我们这是很多宗教的基础第二哥道德基础含括了我在TED所听到的另外三成的道德陈诉
en:The second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.There&#39;s actually ambiguous evidenceas to whether you find reciprocity in other animals,but the evidence for people could not be clearer.This Norman Rockwell painting is called &quot;The Golden Rule,&quot;and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course,as the foundation of so many religions.That second foundation underlies the other 30 percentof the moral statements I&#39;ve heard here at TED.

zh-cn:第三个基础是团队忠诚你可以在动物里面找到群体你可以找到合作团队但这些组织通常不是很小或是牠们都是兄弟姐妹只有在人类的世界里你看到一大群人彼此相处﹐一起合作但在这例子里﹐团队合作是为了和其它团队斗争这大概是来自我们长时间的部落生态﹐部落心理这种部落心态实在太愉快了就算我们已经不在部落里了我们还是照样因为好玩(笑声)运动和战争就像A片和性的关系我们借此发泄那些古老的欲望
en:The third foundation is in-group/loyalty.You do find groups in the animal kingdom —you do find cooperative groups —but these groups are always either very small or they&#39;re all siblings.It&#39;s only among humans that you find very large groups of peoplewho are able to cooperate, join together into groups,but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.This probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology.And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurablethat even when we don&#39;t have tribes,we go ahead and make them, because it&#39;s fun.(Laughter)Sports is to war as pornography is to sex.We get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives.

zh-cn:第四种道德基础是权威-尊敬从这里你可以看到两种非常接近的物种的服从姿态但人类的权威不是以权力和暴力为基础像其它动物而是以自愿的服从﹐有时候甚至是爱的元素
en:The fourth foundation is authority/respect.Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species.But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality,as it is in other primates.It&#39;s based on more voluntary deference,and even elements of love, at times.

zh-cn:第五种基础是纯洁- 神圣这幅画是“贞节的寓意”但纯洁不只是压抑女性性欲而是任何理想﹐任何想法告诉你只要控制你的身体你便可以成善只要控制进入你身体的东西右翼喜欢谈论性方面的道德左翼喜欢用食物今日食物变成一种道德指标这些观点也来自纯洁有关你愿意触摸和放进身体的东西
en:The fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.This painting is called &quot;The Allegory Of Chastity,&quot;but purity&#39;s not just about suppressing female sexuality.It&#39;s about any kind of ideology, any kind of ideathat tells you that you can attain virtueby controlling what you do with your body,by controlling what you put into your body.And while the political right may moralize sex much more,the political left is really doing a lot of it with food.Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays,and a lot of it is ideas about purity,about what you&#39;re willing to touch, or put into your body.

en:I believe these are the five best candidatesfor what&#39;s written on the first draft of the moral mind.I think this is what we come with, at leasta preparedness to learn all of these things.But as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town,how is this first draft going to get revised?And how will it end up being differentfrom a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia?To think about culture variation, let&#39;s try a different metaphor.If there really are five systems at work in the mind —five sources of intuitions and emotions —then we can think of the moral mindas being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels,where you can set it to a different setting on every channel.And my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I,made a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.And so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too.Here are the results.Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens.On the left, I&#39;ve plotted the scores for liberals;on the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates.The blue line shows you people&#39;s responseson the average of all the harm questions.

zh-cn:你可以看到﹐人们真的很关心伤害和照护的问题他们很支持这方面的陈述在整个表上﹐但你也可以看到自由派比保守派更在乎一些﹐线慢慢降了下来公平也是一样但看看其它三条线自由派的分数非常低基本上自由派是说“这根本不是道德。团体 权威 纯洁 - 这些东西和道德一点关系也没有。我拒绝。”但当人越保守﹐这些价值便提升我们可以说自由派有一种 - 双频或是双基础的道德保守派则是有五基础或是五频的道德
en:So, as you see, people care about harm and care issues.They give high endorsement of these sorts of statementsall across the board, but as you also see,liberals care about it a little more than conservatives — the line slopes down.Same story for fairness.But look at the other three lines.For liberals, the scores are very low.Liberals are basically saying, &quot;No, this is not morality.In-group, authority, purity — this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it.&quot;But as people get more conservative, the values rise.We can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel,or two-foundation morality.Conservatives have more of a five-foundation,or five-channel morality.

en:We find this in every country we look at.Here&#39;s the data for 1,100 Canadians.I&#39;ll just flip through a few other slides.The U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe,Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia.Notice also that on all of these graphs,the slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity.Which shows that within any country,the disagreement isn&#39;t over harm and fairness.Everybody — I mean, we debate over what&#39;s fair —but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter.Moral arguments within culturesare especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.

en:This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question.In one recent study,we asked people to suppose you&#39;re about to get a dog.You picked a particular breed,you learned some new information about the breed.Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded,and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal?Well, if you are a liberal, you say, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s great!&quot;Because liberals like to say, &quot;Fetch, please.&quot;(Laughter)But if you&#39;re conservative, that&#39;s not so attractive.If you&#39;re conservative, and you learn that a dog&#39;s extremely loyalto its home and family, and doesn&#39;t warm up quickly to strangers,for conservatives, well, loyalty is good — dogs ought to be loyal.But to a liberal, it sounds like this dogis running for the Republican nomination.(Laughter)

en:So, you might say, OK,there are these differences between liberals and conservatives,but what makes those three other foundations moral?Aren&#39;t those just the foundations of xenophobiaand authoritarianism and Puritanism?What makes them moral?The answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch,&quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights.&quot;In the first panel, we see the moment of creation.All is ordered, all is beautiful, all the people and animalsare doing what they&#39;re supposed to be doing, where they&#39;re supposed to be.But then, given the way of the world, things change.We get every person doing whatever he wants,with every aperture of every other person and every other animal.Some of you might recognize this as the &#39;60s.(Laughter)But the &#39;60s inevitably gives way to the &#39;70s,where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more.Of course, Bosch called this hell.

en:So this triptych, these three panelsportray the timeless truth that order tends to decay.The truth of social entropy.But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imaginationwhere Christians have this weird problem with pleasure,here&#39;s the same story, the same progression,told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago,in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma.A game in which you give people money,and then, on each round of the game,they can put money into a common pot,and then the experimenter doubles what&#39;s in there,and then it&#39;s all divided among the players.So it&#39;s a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues,where we&#39;re asking people to make a sacrificeand they themselves don&#39;t really benefit from their own sacrifice.But you really want everybody else to sacrifice,but everybody has a temptation to a free ride.And what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative —and this is all played anonymously.On the first round, people give about half of the money that they can.But they quickly see, &quot;You know what, other people aren&#39;t doing so much though.I don&#39;t want to be a sucker. I&#39;m not going to cooperate.&quot;And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good, down to close to zero.

zh-cn:但是 - 诀窍在这Fehr 和 Gachter 在第七轮的时候和每个人说”好的﹐新规则如果你要给一些钱来惩罚那些没有贡献的人﹐你可以这样做。“当人们听到惩罚的时候马上变得合作不但合作 而且继续加强有许多研究表示在解决合作问题上 这有明显的帮助只靠人们的好心并不够有些惩罚会更好就算只是羞辱或是被谈论你需要惩罚让人们在大的群体里合作甚至有些最近的研究谈到宗教让人们想到神往往让人们懂得合作 更符合社会期待
en:But then — and here&#39;s the trick —Fehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people,&quot;You know what? New rule.If you want to give some of your own moneyto punish people who aren&#39;t contributing, you can do that.&quot;And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on,cooperation shoots up.It shoots up and it keeps going up.There&#39;s a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps.It&#39;s not enough to just appeal to people&#39;s good motives.It really helps to have some sort of punishment.Even if it&#39;s just shame or embarrassment or gossip,you need some sort of punishment to bring people,when they&#39;re in large groups, to cooperate.There&#39;s even some recent research suggesting that religion —priming God, making people think about God —often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.

en:Some people think that religion is an adaptationevolved both by cultural and biological evolutionto make groups to cohere,in part for the purpose of trusting each other,and then being more effective at competing with other groups.I think that&#39;s probably right,although this is a controversial issue.But I&#39;m particularly interested in religion,and the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us.Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon.The Grand Canyon is really simple.It&#39;s just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time,and you get the Grand Canyon.It&#39;s not that complicated.This is what&#39;s really complicated,that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon,cooperating with each other, or on the savannahs of Africa,or on the frozen shores of Alaska, and then some of these villagesgrew into the mighty cities of Babylon, and Rome, and Tenochtitlan.How did this happen?This is an absolute miracle, much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon.

zh-cn:答案﹐我想﹐是他们用了所有工具盒里面的工具用了所有道德心理学创造了这些合作团队是﹐你需要想到伤害你需要想到正义但如果你有一些小团队﹐便很容易组织大团队这些小团队中有一些内部组织如果你有一些理想可以告诉人压制他们的欲望 去追求更高的 更荣耀的理想现在我们来到自由派和保守派歧义的交会处因为自由派拒绝其中三个基础他们说”不﹐我们应该要支持多样性 不要搞一些小圈圈。“他们说”让我们质疑权威。“他们说”不要给我这些法律。“
en:The answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox.It took all of our moral psychologyto create these cooperative groups.Yes, you do need to be concerned about harm,you do need a psychology of justice.But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups,and if those sub-groups have some internal structure,and if you have some ideology that tells peopleto suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends.And now we get to the crux of the disagreementbetween liberals and conservatives.Because liberals reject three of these foundations.They say &quot;No, let&#39;s celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership.&quot;They say, &quot;Let&#39;s question authority.&quot;And they say, &quot;Keep your laws off my body.&quot;

en:Liberals have very noble motives for doing this.Traditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive,and restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don&#39;t fit in.So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.They want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos.This guy&#39;s shirt says, &quot;Stop bitching, start a revolution.&quot;If you&#39;re high in openness to experience, revolution is good,it&#39;s change, it&#39;s fun.Conservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions.They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom.The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.It&#39;s really precious, and it&#39;s really easy to lose.So as Edmund Burke said, &quot;The restraints on men,as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights.&quot;This was after the chaos of the French Revolution.So once you see this — once you seethat liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute,that they form a balance on change versus stability —then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix.

Yin and yang don&#39;t hate each other.Yin and yang are both necessary, like night and day,for the functioning of the world.You find the same thing in Hinduism.There are many high gods in Hinduism.Two of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body.You have the markings of Vishnu on the left,so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god.You have the markings of Shiva on the right,Shiva&#39;s the liberal god. And they work together.You find the same thing in Buddhism.These two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insightsthat have ever been attained into moral psychology.From the Zen master Seng-ts&#39;an:&quot;If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against.The struggle between for and against is the mind&#39;s worst disease.&quot;Now unfortunately, it&#39;s a diseasethat has been caught by many of the world&#39;s leaders.But before you feel superior to George Bush,before you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this?Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil?Can you be not for or against anything?

en:So, what&#39;s the point? What should you do?Well, if you take the greatest insightsfrom ancient Asian philosophies and religions,and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology,I think you come to these conclusions:that our righteous minds were designed by evolutionto unite us into teams, to divide us against other teamsand then to blind us to the truth.So what should you do? Am I telling you to not strive?Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts&#39;an and stop,stop with this struggle of for and against?No, absolutely not. I&#39;m not saying that.This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much,using so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money,to make the world a better place, to fight —to fight wrongs, to solve problems.

zh-cn:但就像我们在 Samantha Power 的故事里学到的像 Sergio Vieira de Mello﹐你不能直接杀进去然后说”你错了 我对了“因为﹐就像我们刚刚听到的 每个人都以为自己是对的有太多我们需要解决的问题是那些需要我们去改变他人的问题如果你想要改变他人﹐一个比较好的方法是先了解我们是谁 — 了解我们自己的道德心理了解我们都认为自己是对的﹐然后跨出去就算只是一下子﹐跨出去 想想僧璨跨出你的道德框架尝试当做这只是每个人认为自己是对的人的一种拔河每个人﹐就算你不认同他们 都有自己的理由每个人做事都有自己的理由跨出去如果你这样做﹐你便可以培养道德谦逊让你自己离开这个自以为义一种正常人类的心理想想达赖喇嘛想想达赖喇嘛巨大的道德权威这是来自他的道德谦逊
en:But as we learned from Samantha Power, in her storyabout Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can&#39;t just go charging in,saying, &quot;You&#39;re wrong, and I&#39;m right.&quot;Because, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right.A lot of the problems we have to solveare problems that require us to change other people.And if you want to change other people, a much better way to do itis to first understand who we are — understand our moral psychology,understand that we all think we&#39;re right — and then step out,even if it&#39;s just for a moment, step out — check in with Seng-ts&#39;an.Step out of the moral matrix,just try to see it as a struggle playing out,in which everybody does think they&#39;re right,and everybody, at least, has some reasons — even if you disagree with them —everybody has some reasons for what they&#39;re doing.Step out.And if you do that, that&#39;s the essential move to cultivate moral humility,to get yourself out of this self-righteousness,which is the normal human condition.Think about the Dalai Lama.Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama —and it comes from his moral humility.
