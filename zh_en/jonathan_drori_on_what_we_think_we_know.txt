zh-cn:我会试着解释为何我们知道的东西很可能并没有我们自以为知道的多我想从四个问题开始不是那种今年流行的文化问题对了，刚刚那句是个圈内笑话不过这四个问题，事实上即使是很懂科学的人也会觉得很难应答我拿这些问题去问科学节目制片人问那些有科学教育背景的观众也问教科学的老师还有七岁孩童我发现七岁孩童答得比其他人好这是有些令人惊讶
en:I&#39;m going to try and explain why it is that perhapswe don&#39;t understand as much as we think we do.I&#39;d like to begin with four questions.This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year.That&#39;s an in-joke, by the way.But these four questions, actually,are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard.And they&#39;re questions that I&#39;ve asked of science television producers,of audiences of science educators —so that&#39;s science teachers — and also of seven-year-olds,and I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally betterthan the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising.

zh-cn:第一个问题，我建议你把问题记下来抄在纸上，或想像中的纸上坐在电脑前的你也可以试著作答种籽很轻，而大树很重，是吗？我想我们都同意吧，大树用来制成椅子的东西是从哪来的？对吧？这些东西都是怎么来的？（敲椅声）
en:So the first question, and you might want to write this down,either on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paperin your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well.A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right?I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair,right? Where does all this stuff come from?(Knocks)

zh-cn:问题二，你能否点亮一个小灯泡只用1个电池、1个灯泡、和1条电线？那你能画出上述问题的图解吗？不用真的画但如果需要的话， 你能画出来吗？还是你会说这个不可能？
en:And your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulbwith a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?And would you be able to, kind of, draw a — you don&#39;t have to drawthe diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram,if you had to do it? Or would you just say,that&#39;s actually not possible?

zh-cn:第三个问题，为什么夏天比冬天热？大家应该都同意夏天比冬天还热但为何如此？最后，你能不能简单的勾勒出太阳系的平面图...呈现出行星轨道运行的形状你可以画得出来吗？你画得出来的话，就把形状画出来
en:The third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter,but why? And finally, would you be able to —and you can sort of scribble it, if you like —scribble a plan diagram of the solar system,showing the shape of the planets&#39; orbits?Would you be able to do that?And if you can, just scribble a pattern.

zh-cn:好，孩童对事物的概念不是老师教的老师时常这么以为，但实际上概念来自于常理来自于孩童对周遭世界的体验来自于他们跟同伴彼此交流还有跟保姆、父母亲、所有人交流的经验这个领域中的一个专家，对了，愿他安息就是渥西主教，他说要你将东西放进其他人的闹袋里的时候要小心因为那些东西几乎不会再改变，对吧？(笑声)我不太清楚他的死因，真的他最后上了断头台？还是被吊死？（笑声）现在回到那四个问题，大家都知道是什么问题了你们彼此之间也没有讨论答案我平时习惯点人站起来回答让他丢脸不过这次就不点了
en:OK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers,as teachers often think, but actually from common sense,from experience of the world around them,from all the things that go on between them and their peers,and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience.And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him,Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people&#39;s headsbecause it&#39;s virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right?(Laughter)I&#39;m not quite sure how he died, actually.Was he beheaded in the end, or hung?(Laughter)Now, those questions, which, of course, you&#39;ve got right,and you haven&#39;t been conferring, and so on.And I — you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate,but maybe not in this instance.

zh-cn:种籽可以很重，基本上所有的这些99％都来自于空气我相信有85％的人，或许在你们TED会比较少会说木材来自于大地，而有些人也许你们中的一两位， 可能结束后会来找我争论说木材其实是来自于大地若是如此，那我们就会有让卡车跑来跑去把人们的花园都填上土，那会是很棒的生意。不过实际上我们不会那么做因为木材的材料大部分其实是从空气中来的我在英国念书时考生物每考必过我的成绩很好，但毕业后还是以为木材来自于大地
en:A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff,99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it&#39;s fewer at TED,will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people,probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards,and say that actually, it comes out of the ground.Now, if that was true, we&#39;d have trucks going round the country,filling people&#39;s gardens in with soil, it&#39;d be a fantastic business.But, actually, we don&#39;t do that.The mass of this comes out of the air.Now, I passed all my biology exams in Britain.I passed them really well, but I still came out of schoolthinking that that stuff came out of the ground.

zh-cn:你能用一枚电池和一根电线点亮灯泡吗？是，你可以，我会示范怎么做。不过，现在有个坏消息本来有个影片要给大家看可惜在这边声音放不出来所以我就口头描述一下的，用巨蟒剧团的表演方式，影片内容是这样的，在影片里有一群研究员在毕业典礼那天去麻省理工学院为什么是麻省理工呢？因为它离这里很远大家也就不会太介意不过场景设在英国结果也差不多或是设在美国西岸我们问了麻省理工的毕业生这四个问题这些理工科毕业生也答不出来而且还有很多学生表示“我很惊讶你说木材是从空气中来的”这真的让我很吃惊“，那些理工的毕业生这么说我们用”我们是全球第一的理工大学“来作影片的结尾。因为英国人很傲慢(笑声)我们拿第二个问题去问硕士毕业的工程师们他们说这不可能做得到我们拿了电池、电线、和灯泡问他们”你能做到吗?“，他们没办法，是吧？顺道一提，伦敦的帝国学院的情况估计也差不多如此我们不是在做什么反美的事
en:Second one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire?Yes, you can, and I&#39;ll show you in a second how to do that.Now, I have some rather bad news,which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you,which unfortunately — the sound doesn&#39;t work in this room,so I&#39;m going to describe to you, in true &quot;Monty Python&quot; fashion,what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchersgo to MIT on graduation day.We chose MIT because, obviously, that&#39;s a very long way awayfrom here, and you wouldn&#39;t mind too much,but it sort of works the same way in Britainand in the West Coast of the USA.And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questionsof science graduates, and they couldn&#39;t answer them.And so, there&#39;s a whole lot of people saying,&quot;I&#39;d be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.That&#39;s very surprising to me.&quot; And those are science graduates.And we intercut it with, &quot;We are the premier science university in the world,&quot;because of British-like hubris.(Laughter)And when we gave graduate engineers that question,they said it couldn&#39;t be done.And when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb,and said, &quot;Can you do it?&quot; They couldn&#39;t do it. Right?And that&#39;s no different from Imperial College in London, by the way,it&#39;s not some sort of anti-American thing going on.

zh-cn:虽然听来颇像。问题的关键是我们花了很多钱来教育大众，我们应该正确地来做这件事。其中也有一些社会因素让我们想使大众了解光合作用如何运作例如，有一半的碳储量是人类排放的而另一半碳储量我相当关切，身为皇家植物园的受托管理人是植物吸收多少二氧化碳植物就是以此维生的如果在场有芬兰人，这是芬兰话的双关语我们无论在实际上或隐喻上，都是如履薄冰要是我们不明白那些事电池和灯泡只要这要做就行很简单，不是吗？你们都懂了但要是你没有亲手碰过电池和灯泡如果你只看过电路图你可能就做不出来，这是个麻烦
en:As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of moneyfor teaching people — we might as well get it right.And there are also some societal reasonswhy we might want people to understand what it is that&#39;s happeningin photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equationis how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation,as I&#39;m very conscious as a trustee of Kew,is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.That&#39;s what plants actually do for a living.And, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun:we are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin iceif we don&#39;t understand that kind of thing.Now, here&#39;s how you do the battery and the bulb.It&#39;s so easy, isn&#39;t it? Of course, you all knew that.But if you haven&#39;t played with a battery and a bulb,if you&#39;ve only seen a circuit diagram,you might not be able to do that, and that&#39;s one of the problems.

zh-cn:那么，为何夏天比冬天热？我们从小就知道，离热的东西太近你就被烫到，这真很有效的教育方法很小的时候大家就学到了延伸这个论点，我们觉得夏天比冬天热一定是因为我们离太阳比较近我相信大多人都懂了哦，大家都在摇头不过只有几个人摇得很坚定其他人只是这样子摇而已，好吧夏天比冬天热是因为太阳的辐射线传播得比较多，地球倾斜的关系如果你以为是朝太阳的方向倾斜，那就错了太阳离地球1亿5千万公里，地球倾斜角度大略如此倾斜不是差别所在，在北半球夏天时我们离太阳更远跟倾斜没有关系
en:So, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?We learn, as children, that you get closer to something that&#39;s hot,and it burns you. It&#39;s a very powerful bit of learning,and it happens pretty early on.By extension, we think to ourselves, &quot;Why it&#39;s hotter in summer than in wintermust be because we&#39;re closer to the Sun.&quot;I promise you that most of you will have got that.Oh, you&#39;re all shaking your heads,but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.Other ones are kind of going like this. All right.It&#39;s hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sunare spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn&#39;t.The Sun is 93 million miles away, and we&#39;re tilting like this, right?It makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere,we&#39;re further from the Sun in summer,as it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.

zh-cn:好，问题四是画出太阳系的平面图如果大家相信，大多数可能都相信夏天比冬天热是因为地球离太阳较近大家应该都画了椭圆形对吧？这就能解释了吧？除非，你点头了，你画了个椭圆形你有想过，「夜晚又是怎么回事」？澳洲和美国这边，澳洲是夏天这边是冬天，难道说地球在晚上会冲向太阳然后再冲回来？这实在很奇怪我们脑中有两种思考模式，对的和错的身为人类，我们在很多领域都这样思考
en:OK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system.If you believe, as most of you probably do,that it&#39;s hotter in summer than in winter because we&#39;re closer to the Sun,you must have drawn an ellipse.Right? That would explain it, right?Except, in your — you&#39;re nodding — now, in your ellipse,have you thought, &quot;Well, what happens during the night?&quot;Between Australia and here, right, they&#39;ve got summerand we&#39;ve got winter, and what —does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night,and then rush back again? I mean, it&#39;s a very strange thing going on,and we hold these two models in our head, of what&#39;s right and what isn&#39;t right,and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.

zh-cn:左边是哥白尼画的太阳系平面图跟你们纸上画的差不多，对吧右边是NASA的版本，两张图非常相似我希望大家注意其中的巧合要是你知道人们有错误观念，你会怎么做在他们脑中，楕圆形的轨道是他们儿时经验教的吗？你会给他们看什么样的太阳系示意图?证明太阳系不是他们想的那样你会给他们看这种图吗?这是俯瞰的平面图可是并非如此，瞧瞧我在教科书里找到的你会给他们看这种图对吧？出自教科书出自教育网站你找得到的几乎都是这种图会以这种视角呈现是因为只有一堆同心圆太死板无趣从这种视角看太阳系比较新鲜刺激不是吗？因为弄成这种视角如果你脑中有了这种误解用二度空间来呈现三度空间就会变成椭圆形这真是糟糕，可不是吗？因此，我们寻求证据来增强我们的心智模式我们用这种方式处理种族、政治、所有事当然也用这种方式处理科学，我们只观看是科学家在这么做，我们不断寻求证据来增强我们的心智模式，有些人很有办法也乐意提供证据来增强那些模式
en:So, here&#39;s Copernicus&#39; view of what the solar system looked like as a plan.That&#39;s pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right?And this is NASA&#39;s view. They&#39;re stunningly similar.I hope you notice the coincidence here.What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception,right, in their heads, of elliptical orbitscaused by our experiences as children?What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system,to show that it&#39;s not really like that?You&#39;d show them something like this, wouldn&#39;t you?It&#39;s a plan, looking down from above.But, no, look what I found in the textbooks.That&#39;s what you show people, right? These are from textbooks,from websites, educational websites —and almost anything you pick up is like that.And the reason it&#39;s like that is because it&#39;s dead boringto have a load of concentric circles,whereas that&#39;s much more exciting, to look at something at that angle,isn&#39;t it? Right? And by doing it at that angle,if you&#39;ve got that misconception in your head, then thattwo-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses.So you&#39;ve — it&#39;s crap, isn&#39;t it really? As we say.So, these mental models — we look for evidence that reinforces our models.We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else,and we do it in science as well. So we look, just look —and scientists do it, constantly — we look for evidencethat reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too ableand willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.

zh-cn:所以我现在人在美国，就会说欧洲人的坏话这些图片都是我认为不良的科学教育类似教学中心，这些图取自法国维叶特科博馆以及伦敦科博馆的迎宾翼展示区你看看这些东西建成的模样有很多玻璃隔板，蓝光色调，弄得很专业似的那种方式，就像是伍迪艾伦从床单里冒出来在《安妮霍尔》戏中的那一幕他说“老天，这真是太专业了”这其中没有热情，没有动手参与，是吗这是个双关，不过也有好的教学方法我举一个例子，离这里很近，旧金山探索馆在那里所有的东西，展示品之类的都是用孩子能懂的日常用品做成的都可以动手玩，孩子们可以专心玩好好体验我知道麻省理工毕业生以及伦敦帝国学院毕业生手上有电池电线点亮灯泡的话他们会明白其中的原理而不是觉得他们照着电路图来做是做不到的好的教学方法不是沉溺陶醉在自己世界里对吧？那些东西也不该被隔着用玻璃或是钛制品隔开看起来很漂亮就好，好吗？旧金山探索馆在这点做得非常好看上去很业余，但业余得很对头也就是说，根本的出发点是出自爱和热情
en:So, being I&#39;m in the United States, I&#39;ll have a dig at the Europeans.These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in scienceteaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in Franceand the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London.And, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed,there&#39;s a lot of mediation by glass, and it&#39;s very blue, and kind of professional —in that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes upfrom under the sheets in that scene in &quot;Annie Hall,&quot;and said, &quot;God, that&#39;s so professional.&quot; And that you don&#39;t —there&#39;s no passion in it, and it&#39;s not hands on, right,and, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation —I&#39;ll use an example from nearby — is San Francisco Exploratorium,where all the things that — the demonstrations, and so on,are made out of everyday objects that children can understand,it&#39;s very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with.And I know that if the graduates at MITand in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wireand the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it,they would have learned how it actually works,rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can&#39;t do it.So good interpretation is more aboutthings that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?And things that — where there isn&#39;t an extra barrierof a piece of glass or machined titanium,and it all looks fantastic, OK?And the Exploratorium does that really, really well.And it&#39;s amateur, but amateur in the best sense,in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.

zh-cn:所以，孩童不是空瓶子用“巨蟒剧团”的说法就是有点像英国掌玺大臣会说的意思是说孩童不是空无一物的瓶子他们生来就有自己的想法和理念如果你没从这些地方着手，就改变不了他们对吧？我大概没有改变大家的想法对于世界和宇宙到底如何运作不过这些道理同样可以用在推销新科技上也例如，在英国，我们试着把全部的电视都换成新科技的数位电视有个难题是人们对事物运作的方式一旦有了成见就很难去改变我们不是空瓶子，我们保有心智模式从幼年到成年一直都存在不良的教学是弊多于利在美国和英国，在磁力知识上孩童在就学前学得比较好重力知识也一样，两个不同概念，这实在可悲如果你是个老师，看见受教前和受教后的差别实在令人忧心，学童在受教后考得更差我们都是共犯，我们设计测验方式至少在英国是这样，好让人们能通过考试政府也帮了不少忙，他们推波助澜懂吗？我们都是共犯如果有人替我设计测验在我要考生物的时候让我能真正明白，明白我是否真的懂了不是只在淀粉中加入碘液看着反应呈现蓝色而且能真正明白植物是从空气中茁壮的我的科学可能就会学得比较好所以，最重要的是要让人们能表述清楚他们的模型
en:So, children are not empty vessels, OK?So, as &quot;Monty Python&quot; would have it,this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so,but this is — children are not empty vessels.They come with their own ideas and their own theories,and unless you work with those, then you won&#39;t be able to shift them,right? And I probably haven&#39;t shifted your ideasof how the world and universe operates, either.But this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology.For example, we are, in Britain, we&#39;re trying to do a digital switchoverof the whole population into digital technology [for television].And it&#39;s one of the difficult thingsis that when people have preconceptions of how it all works,it&#39;s quite difficult to shift those.So we&#39;re not empty vessels; the mental models that we haveas children persist into adulthood.Poor teaching actually does more harm than good.In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood betterby children before they&#39;ve been to school than afterwards, OK?Same for gravity, two concepts, so it&#39;s — which is quite humbling,as a, you know, if you&#39;re a teacher, and you look before and after,that&#39;s quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching.And we collude. We design tests,or at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back.OK? We collude, and actually if you —if someone had designed a test for mewhen I was doing my biology exams,to really understand, to see whether I&#39;d understoodmore than just kind of putting starch and iodine togetherand seeing it go blue,and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air,then I might have done better at science.So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.
