zh-cn:但是我的心在哪里？我的心还在阿富汗日复一日，我听着新闻当我得知我的国家发生的一切时我的心都碎了我非常想回到祖国但同时，我知道我不能回去因为那里没有我容身之地我有份好工作是大学教授有着不错的收入生活优越家人都在这里我可以和他们在一起但是我并不快乐我想回家于是我去了难民营当我来到巴基斯坦的难民营时那里有七百五十万难民这七百五十万难民当中百分之九十是妇女和儿童男人们大都被杀死或打仗去了在难民营里当我每天都去做例行调查时我发现了一些你无法想象的事情我看到一个寡妇带着五到八个孩子坐在那里哭泣孩子们不知道该干什么我看到一个年轻的妇女无处可去没有教育，没有娱乐，甚至没有生存的地方我看到年轻的男人们失去了他们的父亲和家园尽管只有10到12岁，他们已经开始养家糊口成为一家之长尽力保护他们的姐妹，母亲和他们自己的孩子
en:But where was my heart?My heart was in Afghanistan.Day after day,when I listened to the news,when I followed what wasgoing on with my country,my heart was breaking up.I really wanted to go back to my country,but at the same time I knewI could not go there,because there was no place for me.I had a good job.I was a professor at a university.I earned good money.I had a good life.My family was here.I could live with them.But I wasn&#39;t happy.I wanted to go back home.So I went to the refugee camp.And when I wentto the refugee camp in Pakistan,there were 7.5 million refugees.7.5 million refugees.About 90 percent of themwere women and children.Most of the men have been killedor they were in war.And you know, in the refugee camp,when I went day-to-day to do a survey,I found things you never could imagine.I saw a widow with five to eight childrensitting there and weepingand not knowing what to do.I saw a young womanhave no way to go anywhere,no education, no entertainment,no place to even live.I saw young men that had losttheir father and their home,and they are supporting the familyas a 10-to-12-year old boy —being the head of the household,trying to protect their sisterand their mother and their children.

en:So it was a very devastating situation.My heart was beating for my people,and I didn&#39;t know what to do.At that moment, we talk about momentum.At that moment, I felt,what can I do for these people?How could I help these people?I am one individual.What can I do for them?

en:But at that moment, I knewthat education changed my life.It transformed me. It gave me status.It gave me confidence.It gave me a career.It helped me to support my family,to bring my family to another country,to be safe.And I knew that at that momentthat what I should give to my peopleis education and health,and that&#39;s what I went after.

zh-cn:但是你们觉得它容易吗？它不容易。因为在那个时候，女孩被完全禁止接受教育也因为俄国入侵阿富汗人们不相信任何人告诉他们说我想做这件事真是太难了我是什么身份？一个从美国来的人在美国接受了教育的人他们会相信我吗？当然不会
en:But do you think it was easy?No, because at that time, educationwas banned for girls, completely.And also, by Russia invading Afghanistan,people were not trusting anyone.It was very hard to come and say,&quot;I want to do this.&quot;Who am I?Somebody who comes from the United States.Somebody who got educated here.Did they trust me? Of course not.

zh-cn:所以我真的需要在这个社区建立信任那么我如何做到呢？我去调查去寻访终于，我找到了一个人他当时已有八十岁他是一个毛拉（学者）我去了他在难民营的帐篷里我问他我想让你做一名老师他看着我对我说：“你这个疯女人，竟然想让我当老师？”我说：“我会让你当上老师的。”最终，他答应了。我在他住的地方开了第一堂课消息很快传开了在一年时间里我们开设了二十五所学校！！！一万五千个孩子上了学这真的很了不起
en:So I really needed to buildthe trust in this community.How am I going to do that?I went and surveyed and looked and looked.I asked.Finally, I found one man.He was 80 years old.He was a mullah.I went to his tent in the camp,and I asked him,&quot;I want to make you a teacher.&quot;And he looked at me,and he said, &quot;Crazy woman,crazy woman, how do you thinkI can be a teacher?&quot;And I told him,&quot;I will make you a teacher.&quot;Finally, he accepted my offer,and once I started a classin his compound,the word spread all over.In a matter of one year,we had 25 schools set up,15,000 children going to school,and it was amazing.

en:With the fall of the Taliban,we went into the country,and we opened school after school.We opened women&#39;s learning center.We continuously opened clinics.We worked with mothers and children.We had reproductive health training.We had all kinds of trainingthat you can imagine.I was very happy. I was delightedwith the outcome of my work.And one day, with four trainersand one bodyguard,I was going up north of Kabul,and all of a sudden, again,I was stopped in the middle of the roadby 19 young men.Rifles on their shoulders,they blocked the road.And I told my driver, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;And the driver said, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;He asked them. They said,&quot;We have nothing to do with you.&quot;They called my name.They said, &quot;We want her.&quot;My bodyguard got out, said,&quot;I can answer you.What do you want?&quot;They said, &quot;Nothing.&quot; They called my name.And by that time, the womenare yelling and screaming inside the car.I am very shaken up,and I told myself, this is it.This time, we all are going to be killed.There is no doubt in my mind.But still, the moment comes,and you take strengthfrom whatever you believeand whatever you do.It&#39;s in your heart.You believe in your worth,and you can walk on it.

en:They said, &quot;It&#39;s OK.The only thing we can do, what we know,from the time we&#39;re born,we just hold the gun and kill.That&#39;s all we know.&quot;And you know what that means.It&#39;s a trap to me, of course.So I walk out of there.They said, &quot;We&#39;ll let you go, go.&quot;And so I walked into the car,I sit in the car,and I told the driver,&quot;Turn around and go back to the office.&quot;At that time, we onlywere supporting girls.We only had money for women to train them,to send them to school, and nothing else.

en:By the time I came to the office,of course my trainers were gone.They ran away home. Nobody stayed there.My bodyguard was the only one there,and my voice was completely gone.I was shaken up, and I sat on my table,and I said, &quot;What am I going to do?&quot;How am I going to solve this problem?Because we had traininggoing on up north already.Hundreds of women were therecoming to get training.

en:So I was sitting there,all of a sudden, at this moment,talking about momentum, we are,at that moment,one of my wonderful donorscalled me about a report.And she asked me, &quot;Sakena?&quot;And I answered her.She said, &quot;It&#39;s not you.What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;I said, &quot;Nothing.&quot; I tried to cover.No matter what I tried to do,she didn&#39;t believe me,and she asked me again.&quot;OK, tell me what&#39;s going on?&quot;I told her the whole story.At that time, she said, &quot;OK,you go next time, and you will help them.You will help them.&quot;And when, two days later,I went the same route,and do you know, they were not in here,they were a little back further,the same young men, standing up thereand holding the rifleand pointing to us to stop the car.So we stopped the car.I got out. I said, &quot;OK, let&#39;s go with me.&quot;And they said, &quot;Yes.&quot;I said, &quot;On one condition,that whatever I say, you accept it.&quot;And they said, yes, they do.So I took them to the mosque,and to make a long story short,I told them I&#39;d give them teachers.Today, they are the best trainers.They learn English,they learn how to be teachers,they learn computers,and they are my guides.Every area that is unknown to usin the mountain areas,they go with me.They are ahead, and we go.And they protect us.And —
