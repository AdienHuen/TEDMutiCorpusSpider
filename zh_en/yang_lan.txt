zh-cn:前往苏格兰的前一天晚上我受邀在上海主持了“中国达人秀”的总决赛八万现场观众聚集在体育场内猜猜谁是表演嘉宾？苏珊·波伊尔我对她说“我明天就要去苏格兰”她唱的棒极了甚至还尝试说些中文送你葱这不是类似“你好”或“谢谢”之类普通的话它的意思是“葱免费”她为什么这样说呢？因为这出自一位中国版“苏珊大妈”之口—一位50多岁的女士一位上海菜商她非常钟爱西方歌剧但是她根本不懂英语、法语或者意大利语所以她尝试用中文的蔬菜名称去填词（笑声）她在体育场现场所演唱的“今夜无人入睡”中的最后一句就是“送你葱”所以当苏珊·波伊尔唱的时候现场八万人齐声合唱非常有意思
en:The night before I was heading for Scotland,I was invited to host the finalof &quot;China&#39;s Got Talent&quot; show in Shanghaiwith the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.Guess who was the performing guest?Susan Boyle.And I told her, &quot;I&#39;m going to Scotland the next day.&quot;She sang beautifully,and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese:送你葱So it&#39;s not like &quot;hello&quot; or &quot;thank you,&quot;that ordinary stuff.It means &quot;green onion for free.&quot;Why did she say that?Because it was a linefrom our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle —a 50-some year-old woman,a vegetable vendor in Shanghai,who loves singing Western opera,but she didn&#39;t understandany English or French or Italian,so she managed to fill in the lyricswith vegetable names in Chinese.(Laughter)And the last sentence of Nessun Dormathat she was singing in the stadiumwas &quot;green onion for free.&quot;So [as] Susan Boyle was saying that,80,000 live audience sang together.That was hilarious.

zh-cn:所以我猜苏珊·波伊尔和这位上海菜商都不同寻常她们都是在被称为娱乐圈的行业中在最不被看好的情况下获得成功的勇气和天赋是她们所依靠的节目和平台为她们提供了实现梦想的舞台与众不同并没有多难从不同角度来说我们每个人都各不相同但是我认为与众不同是件好事因为你展示了一种不同的观点你也许有机会去创造不同
en:So I guess both Susan Boyleand this vegetable vendor in Shanghaibelonged to otherness.They were the least expected to be successfulin the business called entertainment,yet their courage and talent brought them through.And a show and a platformgave them the stageto realize their dreams.Well, being different is not that difficult.We are all differentfrom different perspectives.But I think being different is good,because you present a different point of view.You may have the chance to make a difference.

zh-cn:我这一代人非常有幸可以目睹和参与到过去二三十年中给中国带来众多改变的这场历史性转变我记得1990年的时候我那时刚刚大学毕业我应聘了一份销售部门的工作在当时北京第一家五星级酒店北京喜来登长城饭店—这家店现在还在当我被这位日本经理询问了半小时之后他最后说“那么，杨小姐你还有什么问题想问我的吗？”我鼓起勇气泰然自若的说“是的，您可否告诉我你们到底销售的是什么？”我当时对于一个五星级酒店销售部门到底在买什么没有什么概念那是我生平第一次走进一家五星级酒店
en:My generation has been very fortunateto witness and participatein the historic transformation of Chinathat has made so many changesin the past 20, 30 years.I remember that in the year of 1990,when I was graduating from college,I was applying for a job in the sales departmentof the first five-star hotel in Beijing,Great Wall Sheraton — it&#39;s still there.So after being interrogatedby this Japanese manager for a half an hour,he finally said,&quot;So, Miss Yang,do you have any questions to ask me?&quot;I summoned my courage and poise and said,&quot;Yes, but could you let me know,what actually do you sell?&quot;I didn&#39;t have a clue what a sales department was aboutin a five-star hotel.That was the first day I set my footin a five-star hotel.

zh-cn:大约就在同时我参加了一次试镜—中国国家电视台的第一次公开试镜—试镜的还有数千名大学女孩儿制片人对我们说他们想找一些甜美，单纯漂亮的新面孔所以当轮到我的时候，我站起来说“为什么电视上女性的个性总是必须要漂亮，甜美，单纯比较讨好？为什么不能拥有自己的想法自己的声音？”我觉得我好像有点冒犯他们了实际上，他们却对我的话留下了深刻印象于是我入围了第二轮选拔然后是第三轮、第四轮七轮选拔过后我是唯一留下来的选手于是我出现在了国家电视台黄金时段的节目上大家可能不信但那是中国的电视台中第一个允许主持人表达出个人观点而不用照读审核脚本的节目（鼓掌）我当时每周的观众人数在2-3亿人左右
en:Around the same time,I was going through an audition —the first ever open auditionby national television in China —with another thousand college girls.The producer told usthey were looking for some sweet, innocentand beautiful fresh face.So when it was my turn, I stood up and said,&quot;Why [do] women&#39;s personalities on televisionalways have to be beautiful, sweet, innocentand, you know, supportive?Why can&#39;t they have their own ideasand their own voice?&quot;I thought I kind of offended them.But actually, they were impressed by my words.And so I was in the second round of competition,and then the third and the fourth.After seven rounds of competition,I was the last one to survive it.So I was on a national television prime-time show.And believe it or not,that was the first show on Chinese televisionthat allowed its hoststo speak out of their own mindswithout reading an approved script.(Applause)And my weekly audience at that timewas between 200 to 300 million people.

zh-cn:数年后我决定去美国哥伦比亚大学进修研究生同时开始经营我自己的传媒公司这些在我刚刚开始工作的时候是从来没想过的因此我们做了许多工作过去这些年，我面试了一千多人有时，年轻朋友找到我说“杨澜，你改变了我的一生”我为此觉得很自豪但是，我们同样非常幸运可以见证整个国家的转变我是北京申奥团队的一员上海世博会的形象大使我见证了中国融入着世界同样在被世界所接受但是我时常会思考当代的年轻人是什么样的？他们是如何与众不同的什么样的未来是他们将要塑造的中国的未来，说的大一些世界的未来？
en:Well after a few years,I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia Universityto pursue my postgraduate studies,and then started my own media company,which was unthought ofduring the years that I started my career.So we do a lot of things.I&#39;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past.And sometimes I have young people approaching mesay, &quot;Lan, you changed my life,&quot;and I feel proud of that.But then we are also so fortunateto witness the transformation of the whole country.I was in Beijing&#39;s bidding for the Olympic Games.I was representing the Shanghai Expo.I saw China embracing the worldand vice versa.But then sometimes I&#39;m thinking,what are today&#39;s young generation up to?How are they different,and what are the differences they are going to maketo shape the future of China,or at large, the world?

zh-cn:所以，今天我想基于社交媒体平台谈谈年轻人首先，他们是谁？他们看起来是什么样子的？这个女孩儿叫郭美美—20岁的漂亮女孩儿她炫耀自己的名牌包衣服和汽车在自己的微博上中国版的推特同时她自称中国红十字会商业总经理她并没意识到她触及了人们的敏感神经并引起了整个国家的质疑几乎是一片混乱质疑红十字会的信誉论战非常激烈红十字会不得不召开新闻发布会进行澄清同时调查也进行着
en:So today I want to talk about young peoplethrough the platform of social media.First of all, who are they? [What] do they look like?Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei —20 years old, beautiful.She showed off her expensive bags,clothes and caron her microblog,which is the Chinese version of Twitter.And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Crossat the Chamber of Commerce.She didn&#39;t realizethat she stepped on a sensitive nerveand aroused national questioning,almost a turmoil,against the credibility of Red Cross.The controversy was so heatedthat the Red Cross had to open a press conferenceto clarify it,and the investigation is going on.

zh-cn:截至今日我们所知的是她自己编造了那个头衔—也许是因为她觉得和慈善扯上关系很值得炫耀那些奢侈品都是她的男友送她的礼物她男友曾是红十字会商业部下属部门的的一位董事很难理清其中的关系但不管怎样，公众还是不买帐依旧群情激愤这表现出的是一种对以往缺少机构透明度的政府或是拥有政府背景机构的信任缺失这件事同样表明了作为社交媒体的微博所拥有的力量和影响力
en:So far, as of today,we know that she herself made up that title —probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.All those expensive itemswere given to her as giftsby her boyfriend,who used to be a board memberin a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce.It&#39;s very complicated to explain.But anyway, the public still doesn&#39;t buy it.It is still boiling.It shows us a general mistrustof government or government-backed institutions,which lacked transparency in the past.And also it showed usthe power and the impact of social mediaas microblog.

zh-cn:微博兴起于2010年伴随着翻一倍的访问量和三倍使用时间的激增新浪网，主要的新闻门户网站拥有一亿四千多万微博用户腾讯，2亿最受欢迎的博主—不是我自己—是为影星她拥有九百五十多万关注者或是粉丝其中约八成的使用者是年轻人不到30岁如你所知，因为传统媒体依然在政府严格的监管下所以社交媒体就提供了一个信息公开的小缺口但是因为你没有太多其他渠道仅从这个缺口传出的信息有的时候非常的激烈，活跃甚至带有暴力
en:Microblog boomed in the year of 2010,with visitors doubledand time spent on it tripled.Sina.com, a major news portal,alone has more than 140 million microbloggers.On Tencent, 200 million.The most popular blogger —it&#39;s not me —it&#39;s a movie star,and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans.About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people,under 30 years old.And because, as you know,the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government,social media offers an openingto let the steam out a little bit.But because you don&#39;t have many other openings,the heat coming out of this openingis sometimes very strong, activeand even violent.

zh-cn:因此通过微博的方式我们可以去更好的了解中国的年轻人那么他们如何不同呢？首先，他们大多生于80和90后在计划生育政策下基于重男轻女的原因许多家庭进行选择性流产造成现在男性比女性多3千万的现状这可能会给社会带来潜在风险但谁又知道呢我们活在全球化的世界所以他们可以找别的国家的女友他们普遍受过良好的教育中国这一代人中的文盲率不到1%城市里80%的孩子可以接受大学教育但是他们正面临着中国的老龄化65岁以上的人口比重今年达到了百分之七点多并且可能在2030年达到百分之十五众所周知我们有这样的传统那就是年轻人要供养老年人并在他们生病的时候照顾他们这就意味着年轻的夫妇将要供养四位老人中国人口平均寿命为73岁
en:So through microblogging,we are able to understand Chinese youth even better.So how are they different?First of all, most of them were bornin the 80s and 90s,under the one-child policy.And because of selected abortionby families who favored boys to girls,now we have ended upwith 30 million more young men than women.That could posea potential danger to the society,but who knows;we&#39;re in a globalized world,so they can look for girlfriends from other countries.Most of them have fairly good education.The illiteracy rate in China among this generationis under one percent.In cities, 80 percent of kids go to college.But they are facing an aging Chinawith a population above 65 years oldcoming up with seven-point-some percent this year,and about to be 15 percentby the year of 2030.And you know we have the traditionthat younger generations support the elders financially,and taking care of them when they&#39;re sick.So it means young coupleswill have to support four parentswho have a life expectancy of 73 years old.

zh-cn:所以年轻人要过生活并不容易大学毕业生供过于求在城市里大学毕业生找到的第一份工作月薪大约在400美元左右但是平均房租约为500美元以上那么他们怎么办呢？他们不得不合租—挤在非常有限的空间内为了省钱—他们把自己叫做“蚁族”对于那些准备结婚自己买房的人来说他们不得不为此工作30到40年才能负担得起他们的第一套房子同样的数据在美国仅仅需要花费一对夫妇5年的积蓄但在房地产价格飞涨的中国则需要30到40年
en:So making a living is not that easyfor young people.College graduates are not in short supply.In urban areas,college graduates find the starting salaryis about 400 U.S. dollars a month,while the average rentis above $500.So what do they do? They have to share space —squeezed in very limited spaceto save money —and they call themselves &quot;tribe of ants.&quot;And for those who are ready to get marriedand buy their apartment,they figured out they have to workfor 30 to 40 yearsto afford their first apartment.That ratio in Americawould only cost a couple five years to earn,but in China it&#39;s 30 to 40 yearswith the skyrocketing real estate price.

zh-cn:在两亿的外来务工者中六成是年轻人他们发现自己可以说是夹在城市和农村之间他们中的大多数不想再回到农村去但却缺少归属感他们工作时间很长收入和社会福利却很少同时他们却更加脆弱对于失业通货膨胀银行信贷紧缩人民币升值或是欧美国家对于他们所生产商品的需求下降去年有一起令人震惊的事件发生在中国南方一家原始设备制造商的园区内13名年轻的工人在他们20岁左右的年纪选择了自杀一个接一个就像传染病一样他们的动机却是各种不同的个人原因但是整个事件却唤起社会对于外来务工人员身体和精神两方面被孤立的质疑和思考
en:Among the 200 million migrant workers,60 percent of them are young people.They find themselves sort of sandwichedbetween the urban areas and the rural areas.Most of them don&#39;t want to go back to the countryside,but they don&#39;t have the sense of belonging.They work for longer hourswith less income, less social welfare.And they&#39;re more vulnerableto job losses,subject to inflation,tightening loans from banks,appreciation of the renminbi,or decline of demandfrom Europe or Americafor the products they produce.Last year, though,an appalling incidentin a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China:13 young workersin their late teens and early 20scommitted suicide,just one by one like causing a contagious disease.But they died because of all different personal reasons.But this whole incidentaroused a huge outcry from societyabout the isolation,both physical and mental,of these migrant workers.

zh-cn:对于那些返回农村的务工人员他们发现自己在当地很受欢迎因为在城市里通过网络的辅助他们掌握了知识，技术和网络他们可以创造更多就业机会提升当地农业水平同时创造新商机在欠发达的市场因此过去这几年中，沿海地区出现了劳动力资源短缺
en:For those who do return back to the countryside,they find themselves very welcome locally,because with the knowledge, skills and networksthey have learned in the cities,with the assistance of the Internet,they&#39;re able to create more jobs,upgrade local agriculture and create new businessin the less developed market.So for the past few years, the coastal areas,they found themselves in a shortage of labor.

zh-cn:这些图表展示了一个更加普遍的社会背景第一个是恩格尔系数它揭示了日常必需品的消费下降的百分比在最近十年中家庭收入方面下降到37%但是在过去两年中再次上升到39%标志着生活成本的上升基尼系数已经超过警戒线0.4个百分点现在是0.5—甚至比美国更糟糕—展示出了收入的不平衡同时你可以发现整个社会对于缺少流动性变得失去信心同时，对于权力和财富的仇恨心理非常普遍所以任何对于权力部门或商业领域的腐败或幕后交易的指控都会唤起社会的不满甚至是骚乱
en:These diagrams showa more general social background.The first one is the Engels coefficient,which explains that the cost of daily necessitieshas dropped its percentageall through the past decade,in terms of family income,to about 37-some percent.But then in the last two years,it goes up again to 39 percent,indicating a rising living cost.The Gini coefficienthas already passed the dangerous line of 0.4.Now it&#39;s 0.5 —even worse than that in America —showing us the income inequality.And so you see this whole societygetting frustratedabout losing some of its mobility.And also, the bitterness and even resentmenttowards the rich and the powerfulis quite widespread.So any accusations of corruptionor backdoor dealings between authorities or businesswould arouse a social outcryor even unrest.

zh-cn:因此通过微博上的一些热门话题我们可以发现年轻人最关心的是什么社会正义和政府问责制名列前茅最近的十年间大规模的城市化和城市发展让我们看到了许多关于私有财产强制拆迁的报道这同样在年轻人中引起了强烈的愤怒和失望人们有时因此而死有的时候为了保卫自己的财产不惜自焚因此当这些事件越来越频繁的被互联网公之于众的时候人民要求政府采取行动予以制止
en:So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging,we can see what young people care most about.Social justice and government accountabilityruns the first in what they demand.For the past decade or so,a massive urbanization and developmenthave let us witness a lot of reportson the forced demolitionof private property.And it has aroused huge anger and frustrationamong our young generation.Sometimes people get killed,and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest.So when these incidents are reportedmore and more frequently on the Internet,people cry for the government to take actions to stop this.

zh-cn:于是好消息是今年年初的时候国务院通过一项新的规章制度关于房屋的征用和拆除并且把强行拆除的权利从地方政府转移到法院同样的，许多其他事关公共安全的事件同样是网络热门议题我们听到了空气污染水污染和有毒食品问题你知道吗，我们制造假牛肉他们有种配料你把它刷在一片鸡肉或鱼肉上它们就变得看起来像牛肉然后最近人们非常关心食用油问题因为数以千计的人发现[精炼]食用油来自餐厅的地沟油于是所有这些引起了来自互联网的巨大反响幸运的是我们看到政府部门更加及时，更加频繁的对公众关心的问题作出反应
en:So the good news is that earlier this year,the state council passed a new regulationon house requisition and demolitionand passed the rightto order forced demolition from local governmentsto the court.Similarly, many other issues concerning public safetyis a hot topic on the Internet.We heard about polluted air,polluted water, poisoned food.And guess what, we have faked beef.They have sorts of ingredientsthat you brush on a piece of chicken or fish,and it turns it to look like beef.And then lately,people are very concerned about cooking oil,because thousands of people have been found[refining] cooking oilfrom restaurant slop.So all these thingshave aroused a huge outcry from the Internet.And fortunately,we have seen the governmentresponding more timely and also more frequentlyto the public concerns.

zh-cn:同时年轻人看起来更加关注自己在公共政策制定中的参与性但是他们有时有一点点迷失于他们想要什么样的个人生活中国很快将要超越美国成为奢侈品品牌最大的市场—这还不包括中国人在欧洲或者其他地方的消费但是你知道吗？这些消费群体中的一半收入在2000美元以下他们根本不富裕他们把那些包和衣服当作一种身份和社会地位的象征这是一个女孩儿在一档电视交友节目中的话她说她宁愿坐在宝马车里哭也不愿坐在自行车后笑但是，我们当然还是有年轻人仍然会选择微笑不管是坐宝马还是自行车
en:While young people seem to be very sureabout their participationin public policy-making,but sometimes they&#39;re a little bit lostin terms of what they want for their personal life.China is soon to pass the U.S.as the number one marketfor luxury brands —that&#39;s not including the Chinese expendituresin Europe and elsewhere.But you know what, half of those consumersare earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars.They&#39;re not rich at all.They&#39;re taking those bags and clothesas a sense of identity and social status.And this is a girl explicitly sayingon a TV dating showthat she would rather cry in a BMWthan smile on a bicycle.But of course, we do have young peoplewho would still prefer to smile,whether in a BMW or [on] a bicycle.

zh-cn:所以在下张图片中，你会看到一个非常普遍的现象叫做“裸婚”不是说他们裸体去结婚指的是这些年轻夫妇准备好在没有房子，没有汽车，没有钻戒没有结婚典礼的情况下结婚表明他们对于真爱的信奉同时，人们在通过社交媒体做着好事第一张照片向我们展示了一辆满载着500只将要成为食材的流浪狗的卡车被发现并被拦截在高速路上整个国家都在通过微博进行着关注人们捐钱，狗粮自愿去拦截这辆车经过数小时的交涉500只狗被解救同时人们还在帮助寻找丢失的孩子一位父亲把丢失孩子的照片放在网上消息被转发数千次之后孩子被找到了我们也通过微博见证了这个家庭得以重聚
en:So in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenoncalled &quot;naked&quot; wedding, or &quot;naked&quot; marriage.It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding,but it shows that these young couples are ready to get marriedwithout a house, without a car, without a diamond ringand without a wedding banquet,to show their commitment to true love.And also, people are doing good through social media.And the first picture showed usthat a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogsfor food processingwas spotted and stopped on the highwaywith the whole country watchingthrough microblogging.People were donating money, dog foodand offering volunteer work to stop that truck.And after hours of negotiation,500 dogs were rescued.And here also people are helping to find missing children.A father posted his son&#39;s picture onto the Internet.After thousands of resends in relay,the child was found,and we witnessed the reunion of the familythrough microblogging.

zh-cn:幸福是最近两年里我们听到的最多的词汇幸福不仅仅与个人的经历和价值有关同样与大环境有关人们在思考着以下问题我们是否要通过牺牲环境的方式来换取更高的GDP？我们如何完成社会和政治改革从而跟上经济增长的步伐保持可持续性和稳定性？同样，自我更正的系统有多大的能力来保证人们在各种摩擦同时发生的时候得到满意的结果？我觉得人民会给出这些问题以答案同时我们的年轻一代将会改变这个国家同样，在这个过程中改变着他们自己
en:So happiness is the most popular wordwe have heard through the past two years.Happiness is not only relatedto personal experiences and personal values,but also, it&#39;s about the environment.People are thinking about the following questions:Are we going to sacrifice our environment furtherto produce higher GDP?How are we going to perform our social and political reformto keep pace with economic growth,to keep sustainability and stability?And also, how capable is the systemof self-correctnessto keep more people contentwith all sorts of friction going on at the same time?I guess these are the questions people are going to answer.And our younger generationare going to transform this countrywhile at the same time being transformed themselves.
